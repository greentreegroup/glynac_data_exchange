In case of cancellation, the Contractor will invoice LCW for the pro-rated amount due (based on working days, not calendar days), up to and including the last day of full-time work.\u201d \n\u00a0 \nFinally, we have invoiced and received 50% of the SOW fee.\u00a0 AND we invoiced the Neurodiversity session that was delivered, and 100% of the PM fee.\u00a0 They want to know if we are billing forward, or taking \u201cfrom the prepayment pot\u201d.\u00a0 I need to meet with Chuck and SG \u00a0to answer this question before Thursday COB.\u00a0 The complexity of this situation suggests a a live discussion.\u00a0 Thinking about current and future implications goes beyond what we pay LB. \n\u00a0 \nCheers~ \n\u00a0 \nAndrea Wicks Bowles \n(She/Her/Hers) \nSenior Consultant \nLCW \nWebsite\n\u00a0\n|\n\u00a0\nTwitter\n \n|\n\u00a0\nFacebook\n\u00a0\n|\n\u00a0\nLinkedIn\n \nView our upcoming events\n \n| \nSign-up for our newsletter\n \n\u00a0 \n\u00a0\nCONTACT \nRebecca Parrilla\nr.parrilla@lcwmail.com\n+1.773.938.3784\n\u00a0\nCONTACT \nNicole Barile\nn.barile@lcwmail.com\n\u00a0\nCONTACT \nAndrea Bowles\na.wicksbowles@lcwmail.com\n773-938-4181\n\u00a0\nView in HubSpot\n\u00a0\nThis email was sent to \np.seminario@lcwmail.com\n because the notification \nActivity on record you own or follow\n is turned on in the account \nlcwinclusion.com\n (Hub ID: 23618458) \n\u00a0\n\u00a0\nDo you want to stop receiving these emails?\n \u00a0\nTurn off\n \nActivity on record you own or follow\n email notifications. \u00a0\n\u00a0\nHubSpot, Inc.\n2 Canal Park\nCambridge, MA 02141",

This was a confusing one \ud83d\ude42.

(Btw he emailed me that he wasn\u2019t able to do April 28 after all so that date should be crossed off the list on the SOW and it\u2019s actually a total of 16 GroupM sessions, not 18).I\u2019m not sure there would have been a ton of prep for Larry for these sessions because he\u2019s facilitated this content many times in advance, however, he did reserve the dates so in my opinion some courtesy compensation is warranted for the opportunity cost. \u00a0We had contracted to pay him $350 per GroupM session so that would be a total of $840 for 16 sessions. \u00a0 Here\u2019s the timeline of GroupM events in case helpful: 2/10/25: Emailed Larry first Project Assignment: \nhttps://www.dropbox.com/scl/fi/cgc6hgzlh1tmho1gtkmxv/PA-25-01_Baker_Feb-Apri2025-Facilitationsv1.pdf?rlkey=8hi9thqdm0xykzgl1kzk1tl4c&dl=0\n\u00a0with start date of February 24th \u00a0(14 dates / 28\u00a0 GroupM sessions total) 2/13: Lukeisha notified us that they are not ready to start on February 24th\u00a0and it would \u201cprobably be the first or second week in March\u201d. Notified Larry the same day via email 2/18: We had an internal meeting with GroupM. Lukeisha said the earliest first session would be March 14th\u00a0earliest. Notified Larry via email. Sent Larry a revised PA: \nhttps://www.dropbox.com/scl/fi/p4gr7gpj018ykklgwfyo0/PA-20-01_Baker_Mar-Apr2025-Facilitationsv2.pdf?rlkey=atrogqbj39bgbbfletvr0b1zj&dl=0\n\u00a0with the first session being March 14th 2/19: Received signed PA back from Larry 2/21: Larry asked me about a Spencer Stewart session. I asked Chuck about it, He confirmed that this should be added to the PA so I sent Larry a new PA: \nhttps://www.dropbox.com/scl/fi/1lop63gfad8g7fui01bzq/PA-25-01_Baker_Mar-Apr2025-Facilitationsv3.pdf?rlkey=iviqj5abkc1doxksjt4id7cx0&dl=0\n\u00a0which included the Spencer Stewart session on 3/6. The first GroupM session was still listed as 3/14. 3/5: GroupM pushed back first session again and I notified Larry via email. GroupM saying the earliest would be March 21st 3/17: GroupM pushed back the 2025 launch again, this time to \u201clate April at the earliest\u201d, I notified Larry 3/25: We still don\u2019t have a firm start date. GroupM has checked off all but one task they needed to do before we can firm up that date. We have a meeting with them tomorrow (3/16) where hopefully this last task will be resolved (it has to do with their scheduling system). \u00a0 RP \u00a0 Rebecca M.

Jaya and I have been exploring what these LCW sessions could look like for our ERG Leadership team and have a couple question regarding our global colleagues: \n\u00a0 \nWe currently have three executive sponsors based in EMEA and one in APAC. We can likely schedule sessions at a fairly reasonable time for our Americas and EMEA colleagues, but unfortunately not APAC. We obviously do not want our APAC colleague to feel excluded, so I am curious to know how you generally handle a timing issue like this? \nAlong the same vein, we have several APAC and EMEA colleagues who serve in leadership of the ERGs (as co-leads, not Executive Sponsors), so we run into the scheduling issue again. We do want to be able to accommodate all time zones, so I presume we would need a separate session for our EMEA/APAC colleagues. Would there be an additional cost associated with this, and, if so, what would the costs be? We want to be cost conscious but are mindful of these time zone issues and want to be fair to your team, as well. \n\u00a0 \nThanks in advance! \n\u00a0 \nBest, \nLiz \n\u00a0 \nElizabeth \u201cLiz\u201d Bushner\n\u00a0\n(she/her/hers)\nSpencer Stuart\n\u00a0San Francisco\n \nT\u00a0415.808.8905 \nTaking pride in diversity and inclusion\n \n\u00a0 \nThis message is a private communication.

Sorry for sending yet another email, but wanted to let you know that after reading \nthe actual EEOC document\n, it seems to me that Paradigm\u2019s last row below can be confusing or even misleading. Regarding training, the EEOC guidelines state: \n\u00a0 \nTitle VII also\u00a0prohibits employers from limiting, segregating, or classifying employees or applicants based on race, sex, or other protected characteristics in a way that affects their status or deprives them of employment opportunities...\n[28]\n\u00a0 \n\u00a0 \nUnlawful limiting, segregating, or classifying workers related to DEI can arise when employers separate workers into groups based on race, sex, or another protected characteristic when administering DEI or any trainings, workplace programming, or other privileges of employment, even if the separate groups receive the same programming content or amount of employer resources.\n[31]\n\u2026 \n\u00a0 \nEmployers instead should provide \u201ctraining and mentoring that provides workers\u00a0\nof all backgrounds\n\u00a0the opportunity, skill, experience, and information necessary to perform well, and to ascend\u00a0to upper-level jobs.\u201d\n[32]\n\u00a0 \n\u00a0 \nSo I interpret the above as separating workers in terms of who participates or is given the oppty to attend the training, not the \ncontent\n of the training. \n\u00a0 \nJust wanted to clarify that.

I've had some time to go through the menu and have a few questions about pricing for each course. I'm interested in the following sessions,\u00a0divided by type. Are they priced by the hour, by the session or both? It's a little of both and the number of faciltators.\u00a0Let's assume we have 40 people in each session, would we need 3 or 4 sessions of each? We usually suggest that sessions be limited to 25-30 people in order to maximize interaction and engagement. We find that active participation suffers as the number of participants increases. We are flexible, though.\u00a0 Facilitated learning Cultural Competence & Inclusion Skill-Building: Building a Culture of Inclusion (all audiences)\u00a0 Pricing is $8,000 per session.\u00a0 Inclusion\u00a0Skill-Building: Brave Conversations on Race\u00a0+ Power of Allyship Culture (all audiences) Pricing is $8,000 per session for each .\u00a0 Cultural Competence & Inclusion Skill-Building: Building a Culture of Inclusion Pricing is $12,000 \u00a0per session\u00a0+ Leading with Conscious Inclusion (managers & leaders)\u00a0 Pricing is $8,000 per session ELearning -\u00a0We have two models for elearning; 1) a price based on org size which starts at $20k for up to 10,000 users, and 2) for smaller organizations we host the modules for $50 for each user (for 12 months). The latter would work best for you folks. Foundations of Diversity & Inclusion (all audiences) Fostering Collaboration (all audiences) Mini-workshops Foundations\u00a0of Diversity & Inclusion\u00a0Price is $3,600\u00a0per session Spotlight on Intersectionality Price is $3,600\u00a0per session I realize I am repeating myself with the foundations courses, but I think it's important to offer this in different\u00a0ways so the message clicks for everyone, and also because I don't know that everyone will attend each kind of session. Can you tell me what the cost of those selections would be, based on a company of 160 people? We have 50-60 people who are people managers and would be in the manager & leader sessions. Thank you!

Don\u2019t be put off by the final cost in the proposal. \ud83d\ude0a\u00a0\u00a0To build the proposal I had to assume some things around the final number of sessions and the specific manager/leader training you might be interested in. Note that any of the products in the deck can be swapped out for assumptions made in the proposal. \u00a0 Either way, think of this as a menu that we can customize accordingly. \u00a0 You\u2019ll notice that I did not provide pricing on the Diversity Leadership Governance piece yet. I need to talk with the team about how best to represent that outside of the ERG/BRG Consulting Package. As I was reviewing the program I noticed that there wasn\u2019t a clean line item for that piece alone. I will work to get you that tomorrow. \u00a0 Please let me know if you want to meet and discuss anything sent here. We can schedule a follow up call for end of this week/early next week at your convenience. \u00a0 Best, \u00a0 Chuck \u00a0 Chuck Adams (He/Him) Chief Executive Officer LCW Office: +1.773.938.4285 Mobile: +1.630.373.5068 \u00a0 \u00a0 Website: \nhttps://nam10.safelinks.protection.outlook.com/?url=https%3A%2F%2Furl.us.m.mimecastprotect.com%2Fs%2FQZJxC68lwAIrKlnSpfLU5DQ7o%3Fdomain%3Dinfo.lcwinclusion.com&data=05%7C02%7Cc.adams%40lcwmail.com%7Cc9b123cf44b848653bf608dd67fcfeac%7C3ca40a42d72d43c9b92e0740101d9dd3%7C0%7C0%7C638781058542783177%7CUnknown%7CTWFpbGZsb3d8eyJFbXB0eU1hcGkiOnRydWUsIlYiOiIwLjAuMDAwMCIsIlAiOiJXaW4zMiIsIkFOIjoiTWFpbCIsIldUIjoyfQ%3D%3D%7C0%7C%7C%7C&sdata=RiYYa6d6rHn03NeLRXggVp1bF7HgByydaRDZzkrYIFg%3D&reserved=0\n\u00a0|\u00a0Twitter: \nhttps://nam10.safelinks.protection.outlook.com/?url=https%3A%2F%2Furl.us.m.mimecastprotect.com%2Fs%2Fsz7tC73mxBuAkjOCWhWUoRL0R%3Fdomain%3Dinfo.lcwinclusion.com&data=05%7C02%7Cc.adams%40lcwmail.com%7Cc9b123cf44b848653bf608dd67fcfeac%7C3ca40a42d72d43c9b92e0740101d9dd3%7C0%7C0%7C638781058542808227%7CUnknown%7CTWFpbGZsb3d8eyJFbXB0eU1hcGkiOnRydWUsIlYiOiIwLjAuMDAwMCIsIlAiOiJXaW4zMiIsIkFOIjoiTWFpbCIsIldUIjoyfQ%3D%3D%7C0%7C%7C%7C&sdata=ZC6RVIF7ccmu3b5Cm4QiV6ZPvI3u%2Fj4PQJaZ7tCNedk%3D&reserved=0\n |\u00a0Facebook: \nhttps://nam10.safelinks.protection.outlook.com/?url=https%3A%2F%2Furl.us.m.mimecastprotect.com%2Fs%2Fi3FPC82nyDI6R87I2iXUyIGQz%3Fdomain%3Dinfo.lcwinclusion.com&data=05%7C02%7Cc.adams%40lcwmail.com%7Cc9b123cf44b848653bf608dd67fcfeac%7C3ca40a42d72d43c9b92e0740101d9dd3%7C0%7C0%7C638781058542822670%7CUnknown%7CTWFpbGZsb3d8eyJFbXB0eU1hcGkiOnRydWUsIlYiOiIwLjAuMDAwMCIsIlAiOiJXaW4zMiIsIkFOIjoiTWFpbCIsIldUIjoyfQ%3D%3D%7C0%7C%7C%7C&sdata=%2B14Dk1YzAr3IlxMC15C3RKnNaEEXqUgTDgfO3BALt6c%3D&reserved=0\n\u00a0|\u00a0LinkedIn: \nhttps://nam10.safelinks.protection.outlook.com/?url=https%3A%2F%2Furl.us.m.mimecastprotect.com%2Fs%2FBNcZC9rozEckBV5SOsOUq1zvT%3Fdomain%3Dinfo.lcwinclusion.com&data=05%7C02%7Cc.adams%40lcwmail.com%7Cc9b123cf44b848653bf608dd67fcfeac%7C3ca40a42d72d43c9b92e0740101d9dd3%7C0%7C0%7C638781058542838096%7CUnknown%7CTWFpbGZsb3d8eyJFbXB0eU1hcGkiOnRydWUsIlYiOiIwLjAuMDAwMCIsIlAiOiJXaW4zMiIsIkFOIjoiTWFpbCIsIldUIjoyfQ%3D%3D%7C0%7C%7C%7C&sdata=bO%2B%2F95piXK67ZtosNOo2Zfjpm%2B6Wj%2BBEe2QTFOWo718%3D&reserved=0\n View our upcoming events: \nhttps://nam10.safelinks.protection.outlook.com/?url=https%3A%2F%2Furl.us.m.mimecastprotect.com%2Fs%2FGKolC0RNnrhG30RiOtgU9WM7X%3Fdomain%3Dinfo.lcwinclusion.com&data=05%7C02%7Cc.adams%40lcwmail.com%7Cc9b123cf44b848653bf608dd67fcfeac%7C3ca40a42d72d43c9b92e0740101d9dd3%7C0%7C0%7C638781058542851359%7CUnknown%7CTWFpbGZsb3d8eyJFbXB0eU1hcGkiOnRydWUsIlYiOiIwLjAuMDAwMCIsIlAiOiJXaW4zMiIsIkFOIjoiTWFpbCIsIldUIjoyfQ%3D%3D%7C0%7C%7C%7C&sdata=%2FiGrqK3X4Hfu1MXsCh1RxWWqTZGkmvGh1RcuNM7Q5P0%3D&reserved=0\n\u00a0| Sign-up for our newsletter: \nhttps://nam10.safelinks.protection.outlook.com/?url=https%3A%2F%2Furl.us.m.mimecastprotect.com%2Fs%2FdsBoCgJOq9FA25LC7uWU4YGNo%3Fdomain%3Dinfo.lcwinclusion.com&data=05%7C02%7Cc.adams%40lcwmail.com%7Cc9b123cf44b848653bf608dd67fcfeac%7C3ca40a42d72d43c9b92e0740101d9dd3%7C0%7C0%7C638781058542863697%7CUnknown%7CTWFpbGZsb3d8eyJFbXB0eU1hcGkiOnRydWUsIlYiOiIwLjAuMDAwMCIsIlAiOiJXaW4zMiIsIkFOIjoiTWFpbCIsIldUIjoyfQ%3D%3D%7C0%7C%7C%7C&sdata=J83SuVBh7PWWoxL7zguav7kwQqT246ClQ1JhHApirRI%3D&reserved=0\n \u00a0 Disclaimer The information contained in this communication from the sender is confidential.
