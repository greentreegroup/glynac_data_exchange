We\u2019re still catching our breath from a busy DevLearn conference where we had the chance to connect with many of our customers and the eLearning community as a whole. We also recently wrapped up our 3rd annual customer summit, Rustici: The Gathering, with a focus on adapting and embracing change. From the rapidly evolving technologies we use to where and how we work, we covered a lot of great topics and had some incredible customer stories to share. I especially \nenjoyed chatting with our original founder, Mike Rustici\n, on how we've evolved over the years. You don\u2019t want to miss hearing for yourself how grandma says you\u2019re supposed to pronounce \u201cRustici.\u201d (it\u2019s at 49:50 if you want to skip ahead).\nAnd this week, we are all busy catching up with each other in the office and in person during our annual Thanksmas event, my favorite time of year!

We also had the opportunity to interview Acorn PLMS about how their platform uses Rustici Driver behind the scenes.\nSee the highlights \u2192\neLearning standards\nIs SCORM dead? Standards adoption by the SCORM Cloud numbers\nWith SCORM being 20+ years old, it\u2019s understandable that some might question if it\u2019s still viable. Based on SCORM Cloud data, which sees a lot of course launches every day, here\u2019s what the adoption numbers for SCORM, xAPI and cmi5 have to say.\nCheck out the blog \u2192\nProduct news\nPreview Rustici Generator, our new content parsing tool with AI flare\nOur recent webinar dove deep into our latest product, Rustici Generator.

I will gladly take those later sunsets, even if it does mean some dreary mornings, waking up before the sun for the next few weeks. For me the trade-off is worth it. Even though we lost an hour, I feel more rejuvenated as we jump into spring. That's a good thing because we have a pretty busy docket ahead of us with a \nfull conference calendar\n and welcoming a few new faces to the team this month. We're even cooking up a new AI service you'll hear about more later this year.\nI'm also rejuvenated by the way our teams have come together and embraced a \nhybrid working environment\n. It's hard to believe that we've been at this now for four years. It's not always easy, but the benefits of letting people live and work where they want has really paid off for us.\n\u00a0\nTammy Rutherford, Managing Director\nRecent news\nLearn a latte with us at upcoming conferences and webinars\nIf you\u2019ve got travel plans to attend conferences, get your morning caffeine fix with us.

    "body": "You don't often get email from sbammel@koreanconsulting.com. \nLearn why this is important\nRecent discussions have reinforced something I\u2019ve known for a while\u2026\n \nView this email in your browser\nSteven S. Bammel, PhD\nKorean-to-English Translator\nEmail: sbammel@koreanconsulting.com\nWebsite: \nStevenBammel.com\nResume\n - \n\"Consistently Good Work\" Pledge\nHello,\nRecent discussions have reinforced something I\u2019ve known for a while\u2026 Many of the so-called leaders of the localization industry are barely paying attention to freelance translators or small LSPs. In fact, despite what they say about \u201chuman-in-the-loop\u201d workflows, they expect we\u2019ll be gone soon.\nWe can\u2019t sit here and wait for the toolmakers, MT providers, and other big players to dictate the environment in which we work. The competitive pressures are too strong for that. To stay relevant over the long term, we\u2019ve got to develop our own new-paradigm skill set.\nFortunately, Generative AI (GenAI; e.g.ChatGPT) gives us this opportunity! \nRight now, GenAI is a technology for small-scale magic. It is cheap, accessible, and powerful. With GenAI, we can raise both quality and efficiency from the bottom up, using tools and workflows that are more powerful than legacy NMT. \nThis is why I keep emailing you about my \nGenAI for LSPs Workshop\n. During this two-hour event (which is FREE, by the way), I cover the following points:\nGenAI has superpowers.\nGenAI will make you more productive.\nHere\u2019s how AI-savvy linguists are using GenAI right now.\nAs a project manager, you can use GenAI in your daily work, too.\nGenerative AI Iterative Translation (GAIT) is a next-generation workflow.\nYou can support your linguists during the GenAI transition.\nConsider these four ideas to keep moving forward.\nWhen you attend, I will share with you a temporary API key so that you can immediately experience the most powerful GenAI model currently available. You will also get a set of sophisticated prompts, a tool in which to use them (CotranslatorAI Free), some innovative ideas and perspectives, and inspiration to jump ahead.\nI\u2019ve given presentations about GenAI to thousands of translators over the past year and now I\u2019m expanding my efforts. You might wonder why a freelance translator is inviting you to this \nGenAI forLSPs Workshop\n. It\u2019s because I\u2019ve been obsessed with learning about and using GenAI in my language work and nobody is better placed than I am to give you insights into how to work with the technology and connect with your linguists in this area.\nSeveral LSP clients have taken me up on my free workshop offer. If you can arrange at least four members of your team into a workshop, I\u2019ll do a private event for you.\nBut I\u2019ve also scheduled two \u201copen\u201d workshops for LSP clients who would like to attend individually or with just one or two team members. If you\u2019re not ready for the private workshop, then I\u2019d like to invite you to one of these open ones.\nTo register, simply click the workshop you wish to attend and then enter your information on the Zoom registration page that will pop up. I\u2019ll then follow-up with you before the event with instructions to help you get ready.\nClick here to register for Open Workshop #1: Tuesday, February 20 @ 1 PM Central European Time\nClick here to register for Open Workshop #2: Friday, February 23 @ 4 PM US Eastern Standard Time\nMy workshop is nothing like other AI webinars out there; you will be glad you attended.\nI hope to talk to you soon. \nThanks,\nSteven\nWhat you can expect when you work with me:\nAccurate, well-written, and well-formatted translations of your documents\nOn-time delivery every time, sometimes with overnight turnaround\nPrompt and thorough communication before, during, and after your project\nSingle source for both English-to-Korean and Korean-to-English translation\nI personally translate every Korean-to-English translation project myself.\nMy team and I work together on a best-practice, six-eye translation-edit-QA process for English-to-Korean translation jobs.\nConsistently high quality from project to project by leveraging the latest technology and best-practice workflows\nTransparent pricing structure that includes CAT and volume discounts\nWorkflow verifiability, US-based business registration, professional liability insurance, and my \u201cConsistently Good Work\u201d Pledge\nConfidential handling of and respect for your intellectual property, including workflow options with additional security\nServices I provide:\nKorean>English translation\nEnglish>Korean translation\nEnglish>Korean trans-edit-QA\nKorean>English revision\nThe main fields I work in:\nBusiness management\nFinance & accounting\nCorporate/business legal\nIntellectual property\nPublic sector\nMedical & pharmaceutical\nCopyright (C) 2024 Korean Consulting & Translation Service, Inc..

We hosted our 2nd annual customer conference, Rustici: The Gathering, with over 300 customers joining us virtually for 3 days of sessions featuring 15 guest speakers and 30 Rusticians. From our own take on Hot Ones with Joe to hearing our Content Controller customers discuss scaling their content distribution strategies, and from industry experts dropping their xAPI knowledge to \nhow we keep the culture while hybrid\n - we covered a lot of ground.\nOnce we caught our breath, we said farewell to summer with our all-company meetings, that we now call Quails (long story), and a good old fashioned field day. Fun fact: Andy Whitaker\u2019s secret talent is quail egg/spoon racing. And now? We\u2019re continuing to keep the hybrid balance of staying connected virtually and hanging out in-person.\n\u00a0\nTammy Rutherford, Managing Director\nRecent news\nWill we see you at an upcoming conference? We hope so!\nMany students went back to school in the last month, and we\u2019re ready to head back out to conferences!

Hear their top tips for limiting this common SCORM predicament and leave the dungeon with the completion treasure.\nView the recording \u2192\nProduct news\nYou asked and now we have a new SCORM Cloud Tester plan\nSCORM Cloud is an integral part of testing courses for customers and non-customers alike. As content requirements have changed, so have testing needs. That\u2019s why we added a new Tester plan tier specifically for all the users who are testing very frequently.\nSign up for Tester \u2192\nAsk us anything\nDo I need a headless LRS and one with native reporting features?\nThere are several options out there, so how do you know if what you really need is a player, an integrated LRS or a full-fledged reporting tool with an analytics dashboard?

As long as the user makes it to that screen, the file tells our Workday system that the user completed the course, even without check the certification box. Will you please have this fixed. \n\u00a0\nAlso, when leaving the course, the file is bookmarking where the user left off, but the video does not automatically start, and the user has to click twice on the video screen for it to begin playing. The captions also turn off on the bookmarked video and there is no option to turn them back on during the video playback.

As long as the user makes it to that screen, the file tells our Workday system that the user completed the course, even without check the certification box. Will you please have this fixed. \n\u00a0\nAlso, when leaving the course, the file is bookmarking where the user left off, but the video does not automatically start, and the user has to click twice on the video screen for it to begin playing. The captions also turn off on the bookmarked video and there is no option to turn them back on during the video playback.
