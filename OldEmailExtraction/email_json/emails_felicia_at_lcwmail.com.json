    "body": "Plus: the importance of aligned incentives. \nThe upside of in-person work \u00a0\u00b7\u00a0 \nView in browser\n \nThe Insightful Leader\nBY \nKELLOGG INSIGHT\nLeadership advice from the Kellogg School of Management at Northwestern University\nGood morning,\nIt\u2019s been about four years since COVID-19 began spreading across the world\u2014and with it, the popularity of remote work.\nHere in the U.S., most remote-capable jobs (60 percent) used to be done exclusively on-site. But in a \nfew short years\n, those numbers have been flipped on their head. Now that number is just 20 percent. In other words, the majority of workers who can telework now do, at least part time.\nSo at \nKellogg Insight\n, we\u2019re always on the lookout for studies that can tell us how to make sense of remote work. Today, we\u2019ll share one such study. Plus: compensating Elon Musk, and why we\u2019re all suddenly afraid to fly on planes.\nProximity isn\u2019t dead yet\nIn-person work has an important role to play in innovation and, in particular, in how much we are able to \nlearn\n from our collaborators.\n \nThis finding comes from a study by Kellogg\u2019s \nHyejin Youn\n and her collaborator Frank van der Wouden of the University of Hong Kong (and a former Kellogg postdoc). The researchers analyzed more than 17 million scientific publications over the past 45 years.\nSpecifically, they set out to identify scholars who had gained new knowledge from their previous collaborations. A good proxy for this, they realized, was doing research in a new field: someone who started their career in one academic discipline, then collaborated with authors from another discipline, and ultimately published a paper in that new field as a sole author. This seemed like straightforward evidence that they\u2019d learned from their earlier collaboration. In their sample, the team found 1.7 million researchers who fit the bill.\nThen they identified the geographic locations of those researchers and their collaborators. Collaborators were considered \u201clocal\u201d if they were less than 700 meters apart, about a 10-minute walk.\nThey found that researchers who collaborated locally were more likely to gain new knowledge from their teammates than those who collaborated at a distance. The difference was most pronounced in the science and engineering disciplines, as well as for researchers who were in the earlier stages of their careers, and those at lower-ranked institutions.\nThe researchers take this as evidence that being together physically\u2014perhaps reading body language, mulling a problem at a whiteboard, and teaming up to use specialized laboratory equipment\u2014is particularly important for innovation.\nWhich doesn\u2019t mean working remotely doesn\u2019t have its place. Youn is a big fan of hybrid work, where employees can be productive at home, but then work together in-person to generate something new.\n\u201cWe learn from each other in person more than we think we do,\u201d Youn says. \u201cThat\u2019s part of our success as humans, especially when it comes to knowledge that is new, not yet defined. You have to be present to watch and learn. And collaborating locally is the way to do that.\u201d\nYou can read more about the research in \nKellogg Insight\n \nhere\n.\nThe importance of aligning incentives\nElon Musk isn\u2019t the only one who was disappointed when a Delaware judge decided to deny him his $55 billion dollar compensation package. \nGeorge Georgiadis\n, an associate professor of strategy at Kellogg, wasn\u2019t pleased either.\nYes, $55 billion is a pretty eye-popping sum, he acknowledges in a recent piece for \nThe Hill\n. But the package was specifically designed to be high-risk, high-reward to incentivize performance\u2014and somewhat improbably, Tesla\u2019s stock price hit nearly all of its targets.\nMy argument doesn\u2019t center on whether Musk, already a multibillionaire, would be more or less incentivized with $10 billion instead of $50 billion. The concern lies in preserving and protecting the integrity and effectiveness of performance pay.\nPerformance pay can be highly effective in aligning a company\u2019s goals with employees\u2019 actions, even when the likelihood of hitting performance targets seems slim. It aids in retaining employees, particularly high performers. Bonuses, alongside stock and option awards subject to vesting, provide compelling reasons for talented individuals to remain with the company.

    "body": "You don't often get email from johns@drjohnsullivan.com. \nLearn why this is important\nThe recent Post-COVID hiring shortage wasn\u2019t temporary, instead, it\u2019s a permanent business condition.\n \n \nShare\n \n \nShare\n \n \nTweet\n \nLATEST ARTICLE\n \nThis \u201cForever\u201d Hiring Shortage\u2026 Will Forever Hurt Your Business Results (Shifting to Competitive Advantage Recruiting)\nThe recent Post-COVID hiring shortage wasn\u2019t temporary, instead, it\u2019s a permanent business condition. So why isn\u2019t it a standard corporate practice to measure (and respond to) the current level of recruiting competition in your industry?\nDescriptors\n| Recruiting / Hiring shortages \u2013 Future of recruiting components \u2013 5 min read\nIn order to minimize the business damage during this prolonged shortage, Recruiting will be required to make a quantum shift in both its recruiting strategy and its hiring tools. So, the recruiting function now offers its organization a competitive advantage over each of its major recruiting competitors. I call this required new TA strategy, Competitive Advantage Recruiting (or CAR).\nCompetitive Advantage Recruiting\u2026 provides the recruits that allow business units to prosper\nCompetitive Advantage Recruiting is a next-generation recruiting strategy designed to allow a corporation to dominate the hiring competition in its industry. Its primary differentiating factor is that it is externally focused. So, it has as its primary goal the reaching and then the maintaining of a competitive advantage in this permanently competitive marketplace. Of course, for that to happen, every aspect of your recruiting process must have a superior design. So that it produces superior results (when compared side-by-side to the same process in operation at your TA competitors). A second goal is to provide superior recruiting performance as a result of using an objective data-driven recruiting strategy and toolkit. A listing of the core elements of this CAR strategy can be found later in this article.\u00a0\nNote:\n\u00a0You can learn more about the steps for implementing Competitive Advantage Recruiting\u00a0\nhere\n.\u00a0\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\nExpect These Negative Business Consequences\u00a0\n(When you fail to adapt to this forever shortage)\u00a0\nKorn Ferry\n\u00a0estimates that by 2030, this global talent shortfall will result in 85 million open jobs that can\u2019t be filled. And that failure will cost companies trillions of dollars in lost economic opportunities. When that shortfall occurs at your corporation, your executives will realize that this hiring shortage will permanently hurt your sales/profit, stock price, production, AI, supply chain, and innovation. These top 10 negative consequences are listed below, with the highest impact negative consequences appearing early on the list.\u00a0\nExecutives will notice the revenue shortfalls \u2013\n\u00a0when recruiting ends up hiring lower-performing individuals into revenue-generating positions. Or when revenue-generating and revenue-impact positions are left vacant for too long. Your business will not generate enough revenue to meet its budget allocations. And that loss in revenue may actually lower your stock price.\nInnovation will come to a grinding halt \u2013\n\u00a0employees will be overworked because of numerous hiring failures in key positions. These innovator employees simply won\u2019t have the time to collaborate or to think about future innovations. In addition, in a highly competitive marketplace. A strained and poorly designed recruiting process won\u2019t have the capability to recruit additional innovators successfully. Taken together, these will limit your organization\u2019s most valuable human output.\nSome work simply won\u2019t get done\u00a0\n\u2013 when a significant percentage of your priority jobs go unfilled. Much important work simply won\u2019t get done. And when one phase of a business process doesn\u2019t get completed, the output of the entire process will be reduced.\nDeadlines will be missed\n\u00a0\u2013 with a significant percentage of your priority jobs going unfilled. And with other jobs remaining open for months. Many internal and external deadlines will simply be missed.\nWork quality will diminish\n\u00a0\u2013ineffective sourcing and candidate screening processes will result in the hiring of many weak performers. Those mis-hires, coupled with so many unfilled jobs, will require team members to work longer hours just to produce the same volume of work. And that employee strain/stress will likely result in more accidents. As well as a measurably lower quality of work that your customers will likely notice.\nYour new hire turnover will be high\n\u00a0\u2013 because your overworked recruiters won\u2019t likely have enough time to match a top candidate perfectly with their perfect job/manager. Your new hire turnover rate will likely be extremely high, and that will be extremely expensive.\nYou will hire less diversity \u2013\u00a0\ndiverse teams are desirable because studies show they are more productive. However, without a data-driven diversity recruiting process that provides a competitive advantage, you will likely fail to get even your fair share of the available diversity candidates.\nOutdated hiring processes will hurt your brand \u2013\n\u00a0when your image as a desirable company fades. As a result of potential candidates learning about ineffective hiring processes and a poor candidate experience. Over time, your recruiting results will continue to degrade unabated.\nHiring manager time will be wasted\n\u00a0\u2013 a weak, noncompetitive recruiting process will result in many failed searches. And having to reopen so many of them will exhaust and frustrate your hiring managers.\nTA may be outsourced\n\u00a0\u2013 as the hiring shortage at your organization becomes more severe over time. You can expect added pressure from your executives to give up and to outsource your entire function to a lower-cost vendor instead.\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\nHere Are The Core Elements\u2026 Of The CAR Strategy\nFor your corporation to remain successful during this permanent hiring shortfall, I have found that it must shift away from the traditional recruiting model. And shift into this competitive advantage recruiting strategy. A dozen core elements of this Competitive Advantage Recruiting strategy are highlighted below.\nRaise the bar to recruiting domination\u00a0\n\u2013 even the recruiting functions that have been successful in the past. Will struggle throughout this \u201cforever\u201d hiring shortage because of the intense competition that everyone will now face. This will force your executives to raise the bar on recruiting, away from the historical goal of simply being competitive, to a higher goal of recruiting dominance in your industry. And it will be quickly obvious to everyone that you won\u2019t be able to dominate without a much more aggressive strategy and toolkit. That includes a component of continually tracking every aspect of the recruiting marketplace and what each of your TA competitors is doing.\u00a0\nIt is data / metric driven\n\u00a0\u2013 with the high level of competition, you simply can\u2019t tolerate high error rates. So, this CAR strategy emphasizes data-driven decisions and the use of performance metrics throughout the recruiting process.\nIt emphasizes having direct business impacts\n\u00a0\u2013 because clear ownership leads to excellence. TA must accept the accountability for not just completing hires. But going further to ensure that those hires produce measurably higher business impacts. So, as part of the strategy, TA must have a process for measuring the direct business impact that recruiting creates in each strategic business function.\nIt prioritizes key jobs\n\u00a0\u2013 because there are never enough resources to hire the best for every open job. This CAR strategy prioritizes jobs so that it is easier to focus the most and the best recruiting resources on filling these priority jobs with exceptional talent. Similarly, the strategy also prioritizes key business units and teams.\nIt uses a mass personalized recruiting approach\u00a0\n\u2013 research shows that targeted, personalized recruiting is much more effective than the \u201ctreat them all the same\u201d shotgun approach. So, the CAR strategy focuses on providing \u201cmass personalized\u201d recruiting in priority jobs. The first step in mass personalization is accepting the fact that top candidates now hold (and will continue to hold) a lopsided amount of power in the recruiting relationship. Mass personalization also requires you to treat top candidates as unique individuals who will add tremendous value to your organization. This customized approach also requires you to tailor your recruitment marketing and your assessment and selling approaches. So that they closely fit the candidate\u2019s expectations, needs, and job acceptance criteria.\u00a0\nIt is an aggressive strategy \u2013\u00a0\nyou certainly won\u2019t be able to win a long-term \u201cwar for talent\u201d unless you are aggressive and are willing to take some risks. And that level of aggressiveness begins with directly targeting (some call it poaching) the most desirable \u201cpassive candidates\u201d currently fully employed because the very best and most desirable candidates are likely already working across the street at one of your competitors. As an added bonus, when you recruit employees away from individual competitors. You will likely also acquire their organization\u2019s new ideas and best practices.\nThe strategy assumes continuous obsolescence\n\u00a0\u2013 in order to keep up with the rapid speed of change that results from the continuous implementation of new recruiting technology. Recruiting leaders must assume that every element in your current recruiting effort is constantly becoming obsolete. To avoid obsolescence, TA must use data to continually test and then update every individual recruiting process and tool that is beginning to become obsolete.\u00a0\nIt demands that you only use the best sources\n\u00a0\u2013 because all successful hiring of top performers starts with great sourcing. TA leaders must use data to identify and exclusively use the best sources to find candidates for each priority job. Usually, the most effective sourcing channel that should be emphasized is a data-driven referral program that makes every employee a 24/7 talent scout.\nIt hires fast\n\u00a0\u2013 because the competition for top candidates will remain high. The best candidates may now make their job choices even faster. And that will mean that you won\u2019t be successful unless you assess candidates and make offers faster than your competitors. That means that you must analyze every hour of your hiring process. To shorten it without negatively impacting new hire quality.\nIt creates a candidate pipeline\n\u00a0\u2013 one of the keys to successfully hiring the top \u201cpassive candidates.\u201d It is to start identifying and building a relationship of trust with them long before you actually have an open position for them. And the tremendous value added by this \u201cupfront time.\u201d This makes the creation and maintenance of this pipeline essential.\nIt builds a powerful brand\n\u00a0\u2013 in a highly competitive marketplace. It\u2019s important to realize that top candidates are first drawn to employers with a well-known employer brand. So, if you even expect to get the attention of the most in-demand candidates. You must build, maintain, and measure the strength of your organization\u2019s employer brand.\nYour recruiters must be tech and business-savvy\u00a0\n\u2013 to successfully recruit top tech and in-demand talent. You must have sophisticated recruiters who fully understand each candidate and the technologies that they use. Also, to gain the trust and the time of your hiring managers. Your recruiters must fully understand the business environment and the challenges that the hiring manager faces.\nYou must emphasize recruiting remote workers\u00a0\n\u2013 because hiring shortages are often limited to a few geographic areas. Hiring managers can avoid some of those shortages by opening up more remote work opportunities. In addition, hiring managers must realize that they can only land some top global candidates if they offer them a work-at-home option.\u00a0\nNote:\n\u00a0You can learn more about the additional critical success factors in this CAR strategy\u00a0\nhere\n.\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\nIf You Want To Know More About\u2026 The Underlying Causes Of This Shortage\nIf you\u2019re interested, this next section provides a \u201csnapshot list\u201d of what I have found to be the top 10 factors. That is driving this increase in the recruiting competition. Either by increasing the number of job openings or talent competitors. Or by reducing the available supply of applicants.\u00a0\nFactors that are increasing the number of job openings\nThe expanding use of technology results in numerous new job openings\u00a0\n\u2013 the ever-accelerating spread of technology into every business function. This means that there will continue to be multiple job openings available to each qualified candidate. But especially in the functional areas of AI, Quantum Computing, IT, marketing, and data security.\nHigh employee turnover rates are increasing the number of job openings\u00a0\n\u2013 since the beginning of the great resignation, employee turnover rates have been high. With so many employee departures, companies will continue to have more jobs to refill.\u00a0\nWeak corporate recruiting will keep jobs open for longer\n\u00a0\u2013 budget cuts and recruiter layoffs will continue to limit the recruiting capabilities of many corporations. And with so many ineffective corporate recruiting efforts. Most hard-to-fill jobs will stay open much longer. And that will increase the number of days when a recruiter must compete against other active recruiters.\u00a0\nFactors that are decreasing the number of potential applicants\nRapid skill obsolescence reduces the number of highly skilled candidates\u00a0\n\u2013 in our fast-changing world, employee skills quickly become outdated. And that, coupled with massive cutbacks in corporate training, means that the percentage of the workforce currently upskilled in the needed technology areas isn\u2019t rising to meet the demand for skilled new hires. While at the same time, there may be a continuing surplus of lower-skilled workers.\nGig jobs reduce the available corporate workforce\n\u00a0\u2013 the increased availability of gig jobs and Internet income opportunities. It will continue to reduce the percentage of the overall workforce interested in corporate jobs.\nRetirements continue\u00a0\n\u2013 large-scale baby boom retirements are ongoing. And those retirements continue to reduce the size of the available workforce.\u00a0\nThere is a shortage of college grads\u00a0\n\u2013 fewer students are now entering college. And the number of graduates in hot technical majors hasn\u2019t kept up with the demand. So, college recruiting in hot majors will continue to be highly competitive.\nLower levels of immigration\n\u00a0\u2013 lower projected levels of legal immigration. A decrease in the number of foreign students attending US colleges will result in a lower supply of international workers who can work in US facilities.\nSmaller families reduce the growth of the workforce\u00a0\n\u2013 a global population shrinkage trend is now a problem in Italy, Japan, China, and, to some extent, the US. This continuing trend will mean fewer young candidates will enter the workforce over the next decade.\u00a0\nWorker priorities are changing\u00a0\n\u2013 because of the Covid scare and the continuing high unemployment rate. This has caused many potential candidates to take their time in deciding whether they will return to corporate work. In addition, increased levels of employee burnout and harsh return-to-the-office policies are also causing many potential applicants to delay their return to the workforce.\nIf you only do one thing\u00a0\n\u2013 begin to track these ratios. The number of qualified applicants per priority open jobs. And the number of companies actively recruiting for your most critical job to determine how stiff your recruiting competition currently is.\nFinal Thoughts\nHistorically, the critical factors essential for business growth included access to enough capital, land/raw materials, machinery, and labor/management capabilities. However, in today\u2019s fast-moving and quick-to-copy everything global business environment. A new business growth paradigm has been developing. So, over time,\n\u00a0technology capability, innovation, and speed may soon become the three top critical success factors\u00a0\nthat now drive continuous business growth.\u00a0\nAs a result of the emergence of these new growth factors, great hiring has become strategically essential. A corporation simply can\u2019t develop or implement technology, move fast, or innovate without the capability of successfully hiring exceptional candidates in the most competitive recruiting marketplace ever.\nAuthor\u2019s Note\n\u00a0\nPlease spread these ideas\n\u00a0by sharing this article with your team/network\n\u00a0and by posting it on your favorite media.\nAlso, join the well over 20,000+ that follow or have connected with Dr. Sullivan\u2019s community on\u00a0\nLinkedIn\n.\u00a0\nAnd, if you don\u2019t already subscribe to Dr. Sullivan\u2019s Aggressive Talent Management articles, you can do that\u00a0\nhere\n.\nMOST RECENT ARTICLES\nThis \u201cForever\u201d Hiring Shortage\u2026 Will Forever Hurt Your Business Results\u00a0(Shifting to Competitive Advantage Recruiting)\nDiscover Exceptional Candidates \u2013 Scan Resumes For These Talent Indicators\nCompetitive Retaliation \u2013 When They Recruit Your Talent\u2026 Strike Back Hard!

In this free webinar, economist \nNicola Persico\n offers up his home country, Italy, as a cautionary tale for the United States. He argues that demographic changes, debt, and overregulation have led to low growth\u2014and could do the same in America if the country doesn\u2019t make smart policy decisions going forward.\n\u00a0\nRegister\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\nFaculty Speaker\n\u00a0\nNicola Persico\n is the John L. and Helen Kellogg Professor of Managerial Economics & Decision Sciences at Kellogg.

    "body": "Plus: this year's best Super Bowl ads. \nLove at first cite \u00a0\u00b7\u00a0 \nView in browser\n \nThe Insightful Leader\nBY \nKELLOGG INSIGHT\nLeadership advice from the Kellogg School of Management at Northwestern University\nGood morning,\nHappy Valentine\u2019s Day! Here at \nKellogg Insight\n, we may not have candy or roses to offer you, but we do have the next best thing: academic studies about marriage. \nAnd if this particular holiday is not your thing, never fear! We\u2019ll also share some highlights from the \n20th annual Kellogg School Super Bowl Advertising Review\n.\nMatters of the heart\nWant to understand the science of marriage a bit better? For best results, please imagine these findings presented to you in a heart-shaped velvet box: \n1. \nPreparing to tie the knot? Consider a joint bank account. \nAmong the most important discussions newlyweds can have is whether and how to merge their finances. It can be a fraught conversation, as research shows that \nmoney is a leading cause of arguments between partners\n.\nResearch from Kellogg\u2019s \nEli Finkel\n shows one way couples can help preserve their relationship during those critical first years of marriage: by going all in on a joint bank account.\n \nFinkel and his coauthors found that a joint bank account can help couples align their financial goals and adhere to communal norms, rather than behave in a more transactional way. If all money is everyone\u2019s money, then partners don\u2019t need to keep score.\n\u201cThe newlywed years are considered the \u2018connubial crucible.\u2019 That means the dynamics that couples develop in those years predict how their relationship will progress thereafter,\u201d Finkel explains. \u201cWe wanted to take that crucial period and see if we could use bank-account structure to alter how satisfied couples are in their relationships. And we found that we could.\u201d\n2. \nSorry, Stevie: maybe superstition \nis\n the way.\nWhen Kellogg\u2019s \nKieu-Trang Nguyen\n got married, she and her husband didn\u2019t consult the stars to see if they were compatible. But they have plenty of Vietnamese family and friends who did\u2014using Tu Vi, an ancient belief system that offers individuals and couples predictions about future events, such as marriages, births, deaths, business prospects, and travels.\nAs a scholar, Nguyen wanted to know how much these beliefs really matter to couples when it comes to making marriage decisions and whether auspicious marriages fare better.\nHer recent research reveals that couples in auspicious marriages benefit in measurable ways: they earn more and have a higher standard of living, for example, and their children are less likely to drop out of school.\nWhich is not to say that the stars were necessarily right in their predictions. Nguyen says that there\u2019s a self-fulfilling prophecy at work: when a couple\u2019s social circle believes a marriage is auspicious, they are more likely to step in and offer help, buoying the couple through hard times.\n3. \nWhom you marry has important economic effects\u2014beyond your own household. \nWas your spouse\u2019s ambition something you noticed when you were dating? If so, research by Kellogg\u2019s \nBenjamin Friedrich\n suggests you aren\u2019t alone.\nIn particular, Friedrich and his coauthors looked at what is called educational ambition\u2014the starting wages and wage-growth trajectories associated with various educational programs. Using administrative data from Denmark from 1980 to 2018, the researchers found that over the past forty years, couples have become more likely to self-select into marriages with partners in the same ambition category.\nThey estimated that this trend explains more than 40 percent of increasing income inequality since 1980. And the widening gap is driven partly by people in the highest ambition group, who are the most likely to marry one another\u2014and who also earn more than they did four decades ago.\nSo when it comes to couples\u2019\u2014and countries\u2019\u2014financial outcomes, \u201cmarital sorting is becoming more and more important,\u201d Friedrich says.\nThe Super Bowl\u2019s superb ads\nOK, enough of the love stuff.\nFor 20 years, Kellogg\u2019s \nDerek Rucker\n and \nTim Calkins\n have gathered students together to grade Super Bowl ads. Rather than rating them based on solely cleverness or likability\u2014like many of us casual fans do\u2014they use a framework developed by Rucker called \nADPLAN, which measures attention, distinction, positioning, linkage, amplification, and net equity\n. \nIn 2024, the students\u2019 overall winner was Google Pixel for its \u201cJavier in Frame\u201d spot. Like the Kansas City Chiefs, Google took the crown for the second year in a row; its \u201cFixed on Pixel\u201d spot was the 2023 Super Bowl Ad Review winner.\n\u201cGoogle Pixel has clearly figured out the formula to success for advertising in the Super Bowl,\u201d Rucker said after the event. \u201cOnce again the company was able to demonstrate a new technology that enhances the user experience, while also connecting with viewers in an unexpected, emotional way.\u201d \nOther brands that earned top marks included Mountain Dew\u2019s \u201cHaving A Blast\u201d and Dove\u2019s \u201cHard Knocks.\u201d\nOverall, \u201cit was a great year for advertising, and we saw very few brands miss the mark,\u201d Calkins said. \u201cSpots attracted attention with strong linkage, solid branding and utilized \u2018celebrity wow.\u2019\u201d \nAnd if the two organizers had gotten a vote? In \na webinar on Monday\n, Rucker said his favorites were CeraVe and Reese\u2019s, while Calkins gave the nod to Microsoft, Etsy, and Poppi.\nRead more about the Super Bowl Ad Review and this year\u2019s results \nhere\n.\n\u201cIf we are intentional and more inclusive with future growth, we could all but close the wealth gap for the majority of Black Americans.\u201d\n\u2014 Kellogg senior fellow \nDwight Hutchins\n, speaking at the Kellogg and Northwestern Mutual \nGather Against the Gap event\n, which focused on strategies to close the U.S.\u2019s $10 trillion racial wealth gap.\nSee you next week! \nSusie Allen, senior research editor\nKellogg Insight\n\u00a0 \nYou should follow us on \nTwitter\n or \nLinkedIn\n.\nAnd listen to our \npodcasts\n.\nFeedback\n \u00a0\u00b7\u00a0 \nUnsubscribe\n \u00a0\u00b7\u00a0 \nAbout Us\n\u00a9 Kellogg School of Management, Northwestern University.",

    "body": "You don't often get email from johns@drjohnsullivan.com. \nLearn why this is important\nMost resume scans are shallow, so they pass over factors that reveal if a candidate is exceptional.\n \n \nShare\n \n \nShare\n \n \nTweet\n \nLATEST ARTICLE\n \nDiscover Exceptional Candidates \u2013 Scan Resumes For These Talent Indicators\nMost resume scans are shallow, so they pass over factors that reveal if a candidate is exceptional.\u00a0\nDescriptors\u00a0\n| Recruiting/Resume screening \u2013 Talent indicators \u2013 How-to \u2013 5 min read\nWhy Most Resume Scanning Approaches Fail To Identify Exceptional Candidates\nMost traditional resume-scanning processes come up short. They are designed primarily only to identify the job selection requirements that each candidate meets. However, in the cases where you must hire an exceptional candidate, these scans are painfully inadequate. Most of these scans literally \u201cpass over\u201d and fail to record the resume talent factors that indicate when a candidate is exceptional because they have Advanced Talent Capabilities (ATC). These advanced capabilities can include the ability to innovate, learn rapidly, be an early adopter of technology, and have broad industry contacts. And, of course, it is important to realize upfront. Identifying these ATC factors is critical for great hiring because having only a handful of these ATC factors will upgrade a merely qualified candidate\u2026 to an exceptional one.\nThe \u201cAdvanced Talent Capability\u201d Indicators That You Must Identify\nDuring the decades I taught a master class in aggressive recruiting, I continually asked participating hiring managers and recruiters to look beyond the basic selection criteria for a job (i.e., job skills, experience, and credentials). And to identify the advanced capabilities that would make any new hire truly exceptional. So, I now recommend that everyone include a process for identifying them during all human and software resume scans and interviews. The highest impact ATC factors appear early in this following list.\nThey focus on their accomplishments\n\u00a0\u2013 rather than only listing their duties and skills. An exceptional candidate names and then highlights each of their major accomplishments. Highlighting these accomplishments demonstrates that they are results-oriented and provide every one of their deliverables.\n\u00a0An example of content to look for:\u00a0\nI reached 100% of the xyz project goals, including its on-time and under-budget metrics. The director noted that it was the #1 team accomplishment all year. As a result, I was nominated for and won the Employee of the Year award!\nThey quantify their results and provide comparison numbers\u00a0\n\u2013 the language of business and executives focuses on numbers and dollars. So, the best candidates use numbers throughout their resumes to quantify their major results. And to make comparisons between the accomplishments in different departments easier. They also include a dollar value estimate for each major accomplishment and a comparison number to show the extent of the change in the metric (i.e., compared to the average and the previous best and worst numbers).\n\u00a0\nAn example of content to look for:\u00a0\nI\n\u00a0\nimplemented changes to our quality control process that resulted in a 32% increase in output quality (valued this year at $106,000). Last year\u2019s increase in quality was only 12%, and its value was only $34,000).\nThey measure the quality of their work outputs\u00a0\n\u2013 exceptional candidates show that they understand the importance of work in product quality. They do that by reporting the quality of their work immediately after they have revealed the volume of their work.\u00a0\nAn example of content to look for:\u00a0\nI have been consistently ranked as the high-volume producer within the division. At the same time, it maintains a .001% error rate and a 98% customer satisfaction rating.\nThey reveal the quality of the organizations they worked for in their resume\u00a0\n\u2013 this may seem like a minor factor. However, the reviewer downgrades many exceptional candidates because they worked at a weak company or a mostly unknown organization. Automatically downgrading them would be a mistake if the individual worked in one of their most successful business units or teams. So, look for candidates that proactively educate the resume reader. By highlighting several indications of organizational quality (not the size) at each organization where they worked.\n\u00a0An example of content to look for:\u00a0\nI worked at the most innovative business unit at the start-up XYZ Technology. It was ranked #6 for product quality and innovation out of the 167 companies in our chip manufacturing industry.\nThey make it clear that they have worked with key people and the top organizations \u2013\n\u00a0because the best executives and vendors only want to work with the best. Exceptional candidates highlight the fact that they were chosen to provide input, advice, or work for your key executives. They also highlight that they were chosen to work with the best customers and external consultants.\n\u00a0\nAn example of content to look for:\u00a0\nI was selected by my CEO to be the only division employee who was appointed to serve on her strategic planning committee. I was also chosen to shadow the director of Google\u2019s strategic planning during his visits to our facility.\u00a0\nThey demonstrate that they are early adopters of technology\n\u00a0\u2013 rather than fearing new technologies, this candidate actively embraced them. And as part of their commitment and without being told. They demonstrated that they have continually researched, benchmarked, and reported to the team what they have learned about emerging technologies in their field.\n\u00a0\nAn example of content to look for:\u00a0\nAs\u00a0\npart of my self-directed, continuous learning on industry trends. I noticed that AI was projected to become a critical technology in our industry soon. So, I became an AI expert by first reading and then using my extensive industry contracts to benchmark our industry\u2019s \u201cemerging next practices\u201d in the area of AI. As a result, my recommended AI implementation plan was accepted within six months by a unanimous vote of the team.\nThey provide a web link to their actual work \u2013\n\u00a0resume screening and interview processes both have inherent weaknesses. Because you only read/hear a candidate\u2019s words. Even though, in many cases, the best assessment can only occur when an analyst actually reviews their work. So, you should consider it a positive factor whenever a candidate shows that they are proud of their work. By making it easy to access with hyperlinks to samples of the work and what they have written in their field.\u00a0\nAn example of content to look for:\u00a0\nWith the permission of my superiors, I published an online white paper covering the advantages of implementing AI in the sales function. You can gain access to it here on LinkedIn.\nThey demonstrate that they utilize data and metrics everywhere \u2013\n\u00a0Because a top growth area in most business units is to become a data-driven function. So, it makes sense for an exceptional employee to serve as a role model in developing that capability. Look for candidates that \u201cpepper their resume\u201d with the actual performance metrics that they used. And also to show how they have used data to support each of their important decisions.\u00a0\nAn example of content to look for:\u00a0\nBecause of my interest in and knowledge of metrics and data. Even though I didn\u2019t work in recruiting, I was assigned to lead the team that was developing success metrics for that function. As a result, the team developed, tested, and implemented recruiting metrics that covered the quality of hire, time to hire, the new hire failure rate, the cost of a weak hire, and the new hire turnover rate. The head of Google recruiting even called and benchmarked against our work.\nThey demonstrated that they are a serial innovator \u2013\n\u00a0in a rapidly changing world, few outputs are more important than continuous innovation. However, realize that it is often a mistake to only search for the word innovation (because others often misuse the word). Instead, search deeper and look for the actions and behaviors that reveal that an employee is really an innovator. Those actions include developing hypotheses, benchmarking, collaborating with others, experimenting, and learning from failure.\u00a0\nAn example of content to look for:\u00a0\nI created an internal learning group of outside-the-box thinkers with the goal of exploring how we could increase innovation in the sales area. Within three months, the VP formally sanctioned and funded the group. Later, I was asked to successfully develop and lead two other formal innovation groups (in customer service and WFH policy).\nThey admit failure, but they learn from each other \u2013\n\u00a0Teams that operate in a high-risk environment often fail. However, rather than not mentioning the topic, most exceptional candidates are instead open about their major work failures. The employee has used them as an opportunity to learn and improve.\u00a0\nAn example of content to look for:\u00a0\n\u00a0\nOur DEI team developed a new diversity training class for managers. Unfortunately, the reviews of the new class were embarrassing. But rather than waiting, I took ownership of the problem. And I subsequently collaborated with our engineering function\u2019s failure analysis team. And with their help, we identified the 2 root causes and the 6 critical success factors. In this case, we found that the #1 critical success factor always involved \u201cthe customer\u201d in the design and the final testing of all new classes.\nThe candidate is on the leading edge in their profession\u00a0\n\u2013 exceptional new hires usually require little formal training because they pride themselves on being self-directed, continuous learners. One of the ways that you can determine if a candidate is on the leading edge of knowledge in their field and business is by using industry buzzwords throughout their resume and during their interviews.\u00a0\nWhat to look for:\n\u00a0To stay ahead of our industry developments. I completed an online course covering industry trends. In it, I learned about currently hot and emerging subject areas. Including AI, Quantum Computing, Salesforce, Python, overhiring, blockchain, ESG and online team communications platforms\nThey take ownership of problems before others\n\u00a0\u2013 all good employees accept accountability for their area. However, exceptional employees go further and \u201caccept the ownership\u201d of problems no one seems to own. This willingness to act proactively obviously helps to accelerate the team\u2019s overall problem-solving effort.\u00a0\nAn example of content to look for:\u00a0\nI noticed that no one within our team seemed to be addressing our falling customer service scores. So, with my leader\u2019s permission, I alerted everyone that I was accepting ownership, which involved researching the problem and seeking their input on a solution. Within three months, our team leader thanked me for returning our customer service scores to normal.\nThey have business acumen\n\u00a0\u2013 no matter how strong a candidate is in their functional area. It is a fact that they will be able to provide much more additional value. If they are also strong in each of the important functional business areas. So, look for evidence that the candidate also has knowledge and experience in the business competencies. Customer service, selling, goal setting, leadership, metrics, finance, and problem identification.\u00a0\nAn example of content to look for:\u00a0\nEven though I was the youngest store employee, the store manager trusted me. She gave me the financial responsibility for store closing and the end-of-the-day cash reconciliation. During my tenure, we had only one day when, initially, the cash and the receipts were more than $10 out of balance.\nThe candidate will soon be promotable\n\u00a0\u2013 the most desirable candidates are often those who will soon qualify for a promotion. So, when you are assessing a promising candidate, make a rough estimate of how long (minimum and maximum) it will likely be until they are promotable. This assessment of their\u00a0\nlikely career trajectory\n\u00a0after they join your company will help to ensure that you will have a sufficient number of future leaders.\u00a0\nAn example of content to look for:\n\u00a0Have the resume review check their resume to determine if the candidate currently meets over 60% of the promotion requirements for their next level of job. If so, designate them as an exceptional candidate.\u00a0\nTheir resume includes powerful quotes\n\u00a0\u2013 resume screeners should be aware. Exceptional employees are constantly \u201ctalked about\u201d by executives, customers, and managers. As a result, they have received many positive quotes about their capabilities and accomplishments. So, you should expect exceptional candidates to repeat some of those positive quotes in their resumes and during their interviews.\n\u00a0An example of content to look for:\n\u00a0\nThe owner said he was completely impressed with my work at his gas station. \u201cThat he would fully pay for my college education\u201d (And he did).\nAdditional Indicators Of Candidate Excellence\nOf course, every organization has to identify its own set of ATCs that make a candidate exceptional. So, in addition to the above list, I have provided some slightly less impactful talent capabilities in this section. It may also indicate that you have an exceptional candidate.\n\u00a0\nThey are proactive\nThey have a global perspective\nThey quickly adapt to major changes\nThey are a problem solver\nThey are self-motivated\nThey move fast\nThey work effectively in a diverse team\nThey are consistently highly rated and ranked\nThey are an influencer\nThey make others around them better\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014-\nNote: When updating your own resume.\nMake sure that each of the advanced talent capabilities that you have\nare included and easy to find in a quick scan.\nIf you only do one thing\u00a0\n\u2013 From a recent key position opening, identify your preferred top seven capabilities from the Advanced Talent Capabilities list in this article. Next, capture the resume of a recent new hire in that job. One that you have already determined to be an exceptional employee. Thoroughly scan their resume to determine how many of your seven chosen capabilities were covered in that exceptional employee\u2019s resume. Next, do the same resume scan on an average candidate for the same job. Finally, compare the difference between the number of ATCs identified in each resume. These results should reinforce your inclination to develop a formal resume-scanning process that will more accurately identify exceptional candidates in the future.\u00a0\nFinal Thoughts\nUnfortunately, it is fairly common for resume reviewers to rely on their subjective judgment to decide when a candidate should be rated as exceptional. This \u201csoft approach\u201d often results in fewer candidates being designated as exceptional. So, instead, what is needed is a more systematic and objective approach that first identifies each of the important Advanced Talent Capabilities that are relevant to this job. Then, it develops a mandatory process for systematically and thoroughly scanning the resume for all indications of these capabilities.\nAuthor\u2019s Note\nPlease spread these ideas\n\u00a0by sharing this article with your team/network\n\u00a0and by posting it on your favorite media.\u00a0\nAlso, join the well over 20,000+ that follow or have connected with Dr. Sullivan\u2019s community on\u00a0\nLinkedIn\n.\nAnd, if you don\u2019t already subscribe to Dr. Sullivan\u2019s Aggressive Talent Management articles, you can do that\u00a0\nhere\n.\nMOST RECENT ARTICLES\nDiscover Exceptional Candidates \u2013 Scan Resumes For These Talent Indicators\nCompetitive Retaliation \u2013 When They Recruit Your Talent\u2026 Strike Back Hard!

Chances are, you remember it less because of the information it contained and more because of how that information was conveyed. \n\u201cTo be successful, it\u2019s simply not enough to have brilliant ideas. You must also be able to communicate your ideas clearly and concisely in order to persuade investors, stakeholders, and clients,\u201d says \nMichael Foley\n, a clinical assistant professor of leadership and communication at the Kellogg School.\nThis week, we\u2019ll offer some of Foley\u2019s tips for honing your message and connecting with your audience. We\u2019ll also share some research from \nMatt Groh\n, an assistant professor of management and organizations, on the use of AI in medicine.\nA balancing act\nMost speakers are either scripters or wingers, says Foley. Scripters stick closely to their talking points; wingers just, well, tend to wing it. Which method is more effective? According to Foley, neither. The sweet spot is in the middle.\n \nLeaders should aim for what Foley calls \u201cstructured improvisation,\u201d where you prepare your key talking points while giving yourself the freedom to express yourself in a natural and conversational manner.\n\u201cThe structure shows the audience that you\u2019ve done your due diligence and that you\u2019re going to be crisp, clear, and on point,\u201d Foley says. \u201cIt also shows you know where they\u2019re coming from, you\u2019ve anticipated some of their questions already, and you\u2019ve woven them into your content.\u201d\nWhen you master this technique, you can jot down notes on a napkin and talk effortlessly for twenty minutes or more, he says.\nSpeakers should also aim to strike a balance between objective and subjective evidence. Objective evidence\u2014data, statistics, charts\u2014helps you establish context and build a case, especially with technical audiences. Subjective evidence is best used to illustrate a point, such as relating a testimonial to demonstrate client impact.\nKnowing your audience can help you determine how much of each type of evidence you cite. For example, stories work well in business presentations or investment pitches, but might not resonate with analytical audiences such as engineers, PhD researchers, and accountants.\nYou can read the rest of Foley\u2019s recommendations in \nKellogg Insight\n.\nWhat AI can\u2014and can\u2019t\u2014do for medical diagnosis\nLike many fields, medicine is still figuring out how it will make the most effective use of artificial intelligence. While robots are unlikely to replace doctors anytime soon, it\u2019s easy to imagine a future in which the two work together. These physician\u2013machine partnerships hold particular promise for dermatology, a specialty in which diagnosis often comes down to recognizing the visual characteristics of a disease\u2014something that deep-learning systems (DLSs) can be trained to do with great precision. \nThere\u2019s even hope that machine learning could help address a known problem in the field: only 10 percent of images in dermatology textbooks depict patients with darker skin, meaning that physicians may be unfamiliar with the different ways diseases can present across skin tones.\nIn new research, Groh put the issue of machine-aided dermatology to the test by seeing how suggestions from deep-learning systems affected physicians\u2019 photo-based diagnoses. \nThe results were mixed. Assistance from even an imperfect deep-learning system increased dermatologists\u2019 and general practitioners\u2019 diagnostic accuracy\u2014but among general practitioners, the DLS exacerbated disparities in accuracy across light and dark skin. In other words, generalists supported by AI got much better at making correct diagnoses in light skin but only slightly better in darker skin.\nThe findings suggest that the best AI-supported dermatology might look different from how we currently imagine it\u2014and that DLSs and doctors are more powerful together than they are alone. \u201cIt\u2019s all about augmenting humans,\u201d Groh says. \u201cWe\u2019re not trying to automate anyone away. We\u2019re actually trying to understand how augmentation might work, when and where it will be useful, and how we should appropriately design augmentation.\u201d\nYou can read more about the research in \nKellogg Insight\n.\n\u201cWhat my research tries to highlight is that there are certain ESG factors and signals that can be taken advantage of from an investor\u2019s perspective.\u201d\n\u2014 Assistant professor of accounting \nAaron Yoon\n, in \nKellogg Insight\n, on the link between supply-chain ESG risks and stock prices.\nSee you next week!\nSusie Allen, senior research editor\nKellogg Insight\n\u00a0 \nYou should follow us on \nTwitter\n or \nLinkedIn\n.\nAnd listen to our \npodcasts\n.\nFeedback\n \u00a0\u00b7\u00a0 \nUnsubscribe\n \u00a0\u00b7\u00a0 \nAbout Us\n\u00a9 Kellogg School of Management, Northwestern University.",

    "body": "Plus: middle managers and over-the-counter markets. \nScared of AI? Here\u2019s an optimistic take. \u00a0\u00b7\u00a0 \nView in browser\n \nThe Insightful Leader\nBY \nKELLOGG INSIGHT\nLeadership advice from the Kellogg School of Management at Northwestern University\nGood morning,\nQuick: guess how many of the 270 jobs listed in the 1950 census have since been eliminated by automation. Are you thinking a quarter? A third?\n\u201cJust one,\u201d says Kellogg\u2019s \nHatim Rahman\n, an assistant professor of management and organizations. \u201cAnd in case you are wondering, \nthat job was an elevator operator\n.\u201d\nIt\u2019s a statistic that he wants us to keep in mind as we ponder the future of work\u2014and specifically, the \u201cfear that AI is going to suddenly lead to mass unemployment.\u201d Rahman spoke about how AI will affect our careers, and our society, on a recent \nThe Insightful Leader Live\n webinar. Today, we\u2019ll share some highlights from that discussion.\nChange happens more slowly than we think\nIf worries about AI decimating the labor force and taking away your livelihood have been keeping you up at night, Rahman has some words of reassurance: \u201cDecades of research shows that fear is unfounded.\u201d\n \nAs much as it \nfeels like\n technology is advancing so rapidly that we can barely keep up, it takes much longer for those advances to fully embed themselves in society. This will be true of AI, too. \u201cIt\u2019s going to take a long time for it to penetrate an industry, especially in ways that will affect your career,\u201d says Rahman.\nThis may be cold comfort to individual illustrators, translators, and journalists who have already \nlost some work to generative AI\n. But zoom out a bit, and it\u2019s clear that while these professions are the first to be affected by the technology, they are nowhere near obsolete. Instead, they are changing, as AI is gradually incorporated into various work streams and new infrastructure emerges to support it. \u201cThe more complex the technology, the more technical, human, and monetary resources are needed to develop, integrate, and maintain [the] technology,\u201d says Rahman.\nHow we use AI is up to us\nBy now you\u2019ve surely heard the argument that AI is neither good nor bad, but simply a tool. Much will depend, then, upon how we choose to deploy it. And, Rahman says, there is time for us to make this choice collectively and deliberately.\nWe can choose to use AI to replace as many workers as possible\u2014or we can instead choose to use AI to bolster talent and identify it in underrecognized places. We can choose to let machines make the bulk of the decisions around our healthcare, education, and defense\u2014or we can choose to keep humans at the helm, ensuring that human values and priorities rule the day.\nAnd it\u2019s not pollyannaish to think we\u2019ll actually have a choice. There are already areas where we\u2019ve opted to prioritize human involvement. Take aviation. Despite estimates that more than 90 percent of a pilot\u2019s responsibilities can be automated, our society has still decided to put well-trained pilots, capable of flying manually, in the cockpit in case things go awry.\nAutomation has worked out pretty well for pilots, says Rahman. \u201cIn fact, in aggregate, \nthe number of pilots and their pay has increased for years\n.\u201d\nTo learn more about how AI will reshape our world, \nyou can read more in \nKellogg Insight\n.\nTalking Point\nTo sell an asset for the highest price, you generally want to solicit offers from as many buyers as possible. The same goes for purchasing: the more potential sellers you approach, the better the deal you\u2019ll probably get. The benefits of competition are, after all, a cornerstone of economics. But in over-the-counter (OTC) markets\u2014or networks for trading securities not listed on formalized exchanges\u2014investors have historically sought few counterparties, something researchers have struggled to explain. A new study finds that OTC investors are motivated by concerns about front-running\u2014that is, when counterparties know what move an investor plans to make, they can take steps to raise or lower the price of that asset. Contacting few counterparties, the research shows, protects against this problem. \nRead more in \nKellogg Insight\n.\n\u201cHow do we let people go home from work at a reasonable time, disconnect at a reasonable time, not burden them with emails on the weekends, on vacations, after hours?\u201d\n\u2014 Professor of management and organizations \nAdam Waytz\n, on \nMarketplace\n, on the plight of middle managers and the importance of letting them unplug.\nSee you next week!\nSusie Allen, senior research editor\nKellogg Insight\n\u00a0 \nYou should follow us on \nTwitter\n or \nLinkedIn\n.\nAnd listen to our \npodcasts\n.\nFeedback\n \u00a0\u00b7\u00a0 \nUnsubscribe\n \u00a0\u00b7\u00a0 \nAbout Us\n\u00a9 Kellogg School of Management, Northwestern University.",

No, not like that. \u00a0\u00b7\u00a0 \nView in browser\n \nThe Insightful Leader\nBY \nKELLOGG INSIGHT\nLeadership advice from the Kellogg School of Management at Northwestern University\nGood morning,\nEarly in her career, \nEllen Taaffe\n got some advice she didn\u2019t like. Taaffe, who enjoys wearing bright colors, was told by her boss that her red blazers were making her stand out in the wrong way. She should wear a navy blazer, like the rest of her team.\nTaaffe, a clinical associate professor of management and organizations and author of the recent book \nThe Mirrored Door\n, has subsequently thought a lot about how we present ourselves at work. But at the time of the red blazer showdown, she didn\u2019t know what to think or do. Should she wear the clothes that felt right to her\u2014or accept this as one of those parts of herself that she doesn\u2019t bring to the office? \nToday, we\u2019ll delve into the thorny issue of personal authenticity in the workplace. We\u2019ll also discuss what happens when wealthy foreigners move to popular global cities.\nHow should you present yourself at work?\nIn the end, Taaffe didn\u2019t ditch her red blazers. And in \na recent episode of The Insightful Leader podcast\n, she explained that she\u2019s glad she stuck to her guns. It made room for other people to shed the unofficial navy blue uniform, too. \u201cSo I think that was helpful,\u201d she said.\n \nThere\u2019s been a lot of discussion in recent years about the importance of being able to bring our whole selves to work. There are a lot of good reasons for this, particularly when it comes to creating a workplace that feels inclusive to people who haven\u2019t always been included.\nBut it\u2019s also important to acknowledge that, fair or not, how we show up at work could affect how we are treated. \nFor instance, wearing pajamas at work probably doesn\u2019t send the right message about your level of professionalism or how much you respect the people around you. But dressing too fancily can backfire, too. Take this research from \nDerek Rucker\n, a professor of marketing, who has researched how people react to luxury brands. In one study, he found that mentioning high-status items can hurt job candidates applying for positions that require a lot of personal warmth (for example, human resources).\nRucker says he thinks about how he dresses more than he used to \u201cbecause I realized there may be unintended signals that I send,\u201d he said. \u201cAnd so I don\u2019t obsess about it to the point where it\u2019s like, let me think about every single item every single day. \u2026 But if I\u2019m meeting new people, I think a little more about what I will wear and how I present myself.\u201d\nSo, how do you decide when it\u2019s worth it to present yourself as you truly are\u2014and when not to? And how can managers create an environment where people feel safe to be themselves in the right ways? For more on how to thread these needles, \nyou can listen to the whole episode\n.\nTalking Point\nWho among us hasn\u2019t dreamed\u2014even just in passing\u2014about starting life afresh in some far-flung place? In recent decades, the decreased cost of air travel and the rise of remote work have made that dream a reality for some. Popular global cities, including Paris and Venice, have seen a surge of foreign arrivals from wealthy countries, laptops in hand and stars in their eyes, settling in for months or longer. For governments, the new arrivals pose a tricky challenge: they are a boon to local economies but also bring increases in rents, traffic, and congestion. So should new arrivals be discouraged or encouraged? \nNew research\n by finance professor \nSergio Rebelo\n tackles that question and finds a creative way to harness the upsides while minimizing the downsides. Specifically, he and his coauthors suggest taxing capital gains on property sales and using the revenue to help offset the harms caused to locals.\nRead more in \nKellogg Insight\n. \n\u201cA lot of low-wage occupations are going to be automated by AI, \u2026 and it\u2019s going to increase pay for occupations that use AI as a complement.\u201d\n\u2014 Professor of finance \nDimitris Papanikolaou\n, speaking at the \nAmerican Finance Association annual meeting\n, on how AI will affect the labor market.\nSee you next week!\nSusie Allen, senior research editor\nKellogg Insight\n\u00a0 \nYou should follow us on \nTwitter\n or \nLinkedIn\n.\nAnd listen to our \npodcasts\n.\nFeedback\n \u00a0\u00b7\u00a0 \nUnsubscribe\n \u00a0\u00b7\u00a0 \nAbout Us\n\u00a9 Kellogg School of Management, Northwestern University.",

That positivity also means they are uncomfortable with the criticism that comes along with failure. However, I find that perspective to be a serious miscalculation. Because \u201c\ncriticism is the engine of change,\u201d\u00a0\nit is beneficial as it harnesses outsiders (with fresh eyes) to help you understand every aspect of what went wrong.\nThe many benefits of failure include:\nIt makes you stronger\nIt tells you what not to do again\nIt forces you to innovate\nIt reveals the root causes of failure\nIt\u2019s an excuse to interact with executives\nIt keeps your ego in check\nIt illuminates the path to success\nIt forces you to focus on output quality\nIt provides you with fresh criticism\nIt forces you to use metrics and collect data\n\u201cIt\u2019s fine to celebrate success,\n\u00a0\nbut it is more important to heed the lessons of failure.\u201d\u2015\n\u00a0Bill Gates\nThe Eight Major Failure Areas In HR\nThe remainder of this article covers eight major failure areas in HR. And within each of these eight areas. I provide at least one \u201csnapshot data point\u201d supporting the argument covering why that HR area deserves closer examination.\u00a0\nHR failure #1 \u2013\n\u00a0New data suggests that\u2026 HR\u2019s current benefits expansion means higher costs but perhaps no real impact\u00a0\n\u2013 although HR leaders might not be aware of it. Since COVID, HR has essentially advocated a new form of\u00a0\ncorporate paternalism\n. HR has been striving to take care of more and more \u201cworker needs and wants.\u201d Even though meeting these new wants might not impact worker productivity or retention. So, in most of HR, it is still a common practice to propose and implement these new \u201csoft wellness benefits.\u201d Without any data proving that they produce the desired results and have a positive ROI (the dollars of business impacts outweigh the program\u2019s costs). And because these programs can be costly, the HR cost area that used to be called \u201cfringe benefits.\u201d Have now reached 30% of the average worker\u2019s paycheck.\u00a0\nConsider this new data a benefit\u2019s wake-up call\n\u00a0\u2013 unfortunately, the benefits function has done little to prove the business impacts of each of its offerings. But that omission is about to change. Fortunately, one major university recently concluded a comprehensive analysis covering the measurable impacts of 90 of these new \u201csoft\u201d benefit programs. The 90 different benefits that were analyzed include sleep apps and digital wellness solutions. Courses/seminars that cover coaching, mindfulness, massage, resilience, relaxation, time management, and financial health.\u00a0\nAnd if you have time to read this eye-opening study, you can find it by clicking\u00a0\nhere\n. Fortunately,\u00a0\nthe New York Times has summarized its results\n. The NYT reported that employees who participated in these 90 different programs\u00a0\nwere no better off\n\u00a0than colleagues who did not use them. As a result of this startling discovery, I recommend that every major corporation begin researching the employee saved, scheduled impacts, and the ROI of each existing or proposed HR benefit program.\nHR failure #2 \u2013\n\u00a0\nHR has still not been rated as strategic\u00a0\n\u2013 HR has continually failed even to get a majority of our business leaders to rate HR as strategic. And\u00a0\nnew survey data reveals\n\u00a0that HR\u2019s strategic rating has risen only a mere 1% since 2018. And our 46% strategic rating is, unfortunately, a full 21 points behind finance.\nHR failure #3 \u2013\n\u00a0HR is still not trusted by our employees\u2026 despite all of our efforts\n\u00a0\u2013 being fully trusted by your employees is a major goal of every HR function. However, a survey of major tech companies found\u00a0\nthat 70% of employees don\u2019t trust HR\n. And not a single one of these 18 top tech companies had a majority of its own employees say that they trusted HR at their company. And that \u201cdon\u2019t trust\u201d percentage rose to a whopping 83% at Intel.\nHR failure #4 \u2013\n\u00a0\nHiring, our most impactful sub-function, has a painfully high failure rate\n\u00a0\u2013 unfortunately, for years. The Conference Board has rated hiring as a top executive challenge in its annual\u00a0\nC-suite survey\n. The fact that hiring has remained a top challenge for so many years is by itself an indication of the failure of recruiting. The failure rate of new hires is a second failure area. Extensive research by Leadership IQ has revealed that\u00a0\nthe average hiring failure rate\n\u00a0is an astonishingly high 46%. And only 19 percent of new hires actually achieve unequivocal success. The third major failure area in recruiting has been the consistent \u201coverhiring\u201d over the last few years without effective workforce planning. As a consequence of this overhiring, many companies have been forced to initiate painful, large-scale, costly layoffs. The most essential remedial action for recruiting leadership is to begin measuring the on-the-job performance of new hires and the factors that accurately predict it for each job.\nHR failure #5 \u2013\n\u00a0Training and development produce expensive failures\n\u00a0\u2013 this function is among the largest spenders in the HR budget. However, research shows that an amazing 90% of individual training programs\u00a0\nfail to reach their targeted outcomes\n. This is partly because 90% of the provided content doesn\u2019t significantly change employee behavior. Therefore, 75% of\u00a0\nmanagers report that they are dissatisfied\n\u00a0with their L&D function. Instead, L&D must learn to calculate the ROI of each of its programs. Then, keep only the programs that have a direct, sustained, measurable impact on participant productivity.\nHR failure #6 \u2013\n\u00a0Our diversity results have been embarrassing \u2013\n\u00a0one DEI expert concluded, \u201cResearchers have studied the effects of diversity training for years, and they\u2019ve found a resounding theme:\u00a0\nmost DEI programs don\u2019t work\n.\u201d Other research supports this conclusion. Less than 2% of HR leaders reported that they were confident that they were\u00a0\nactually achieving their DE&I goals\n. Employees also support that conclusion because 62% of workers rated their\u00a0\nDEI programs to be ineffective\n. Today, with the increasing level of pushback on DEI programs, Now is an ideal time to make DEI a 100% data-driven function.\nHR failure #7 \u2013\n\u00a0Turnover has skyrocketed, but HR still has no answer\u00a0\n\u2013 HR\u2019s haphazard, mostly intuitive approach to stopping the great resignation has had little effect. Employee retention has remained the\u00a0\nnumber one operational priority\n. And perhaps the costliest turnover area is new-hire turnover. Research by BambooHR\u00a0\nfound that as many as 33% of new hires leave in the first month\n. And after three months, 68% of your new hires will have left. Instead, what is needed is a data-driven approach that identifies the major causes of turnover and the most effective tool for minimizing each cause. Employees also need to be prioritized for retention so that the highest-impact employees receive the most attention.\nHR failure #8 \u2013\n\u00a0The execution within HR also frequently fails\n\u00a0\u2013 unfortunately, HR often stumbles in its ability to execute. That problem is illustrated by the fact that 84% of HR professionals report that their\u00a0\nrecent HR Projects have been unsuccessful\n. And with such a high failure rate of new programs. Every HR function needs to research the\u201d critical success factors\u201d in successful HR operations.\n\u201cThe difference between average people and achieving people\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0is their perception of and response to failure.\u201d\n\u00a0\u2013 John C. Maxwell\nFinal Thoughts\nHR needs to learn from other innovators if it wants to become an innovative function. And that lesson is \u201crather than treating failure as an enemy, embrace it as a powerful learning and motivation tool.\u201d So, in that light, I find that the beginning of each year is the ideal time to examine and learn from last year\u2019s failures. A good starting place is to require each subprogram within HR to begin measuring and reporting its failure rate. The subfunctions to target include hiring, retention, onboarding, L&D, performance management, diversity, and internal movement. In my experience, HR can\u2019t become strategic until it first systematically identifies each of its major failure areas. And then, after each failure, it conducts \u201c\nfailure analysis\n\u201d in order to identify which factors contributed to each failure.\n\u201cI have not failed. I have found 10,000 ways that don\u2019t work.\u201d\n\u00a0\u2015 Thomas Edison\nAuthor\u2019s Note\nPlease spread these ideas\n\u00a0by sharing this article with your team/network\n\u00a0and by posting it on your favorite media.\u00a0\nAlso, join the well over 20,000+\u00a0that follow or have connected with Dr. Sullivan\u2019s community on\u00a0\nLinkedIn\n.\nAnd, if you don\u2019t already subscribe to Dr. Sullivan\u2019s Aggressive Talent Management articles, you can do that\u00a0\nhere\n.\nMOST RECENT ARTICLES\n8 Ugly Numbers\u2026 That Highlight HR\u2019s Failures\nThe Most Read Talent Management Articles (Dr. Sullivan highlights 6 simple recruiting tools)\nA Decision Filter\u2026 A Simple Tool For Making Fast Objective Program Approval Decisions\nNew Year\u2019s Resolutions For Progressive Recruiters (Simple but effective recruiting tools)\nRESOURCES\n \nStay Interviews and Other Powerful Retention Tools\nIn this brand new eBook, learn how to implement Stay Interviews, the highest ROI activity that any manager can utilize which\u00a0has been proven effective in keeping top performers.\nPURCHASE HERE\n \n \nOnboarding & Orientation Toolkit\nHave you been frustrated that it takes new hires/transfers longer than it should to get up-to-speed and become productive faster?

What happened? Are we really in the clear?\nThis week, we\u2019ll hear from Kellogg\u2019s \nJanice Eberly\n on the recession that wasn\u2019t and the general state of the economy. We\u2019ll also share some advice on managing the succession challenge in family businesses.\nWhat\u2019s going on with the U.S. economy?\nCast your mind back to late 2022 and early 2023: supply chains were still a mess from the pandemic. Immigration and labor-force participation were down, sending wages skyrocketing. Inflation was sitting at an eye-popping 6.5 percent. \nNo wonder economists were worried.\n \nBut, \nas Eberly told \nThe Wall Street Journal\n, \u201cthe U.S. economy was in a very different place than it is now.\u201d Those struggles\u2014with supply chains, hiring, and inflation\u2014all lessened over the course of 2023. \nThe \nJournal\n was covering the American Economic Association\u2019s annual meeting in San Antonio, TX. Among the experts there, the consensus was now that the U.S. is headed for a \u201csoft landing\u201d\u2014that is, decreased inflation without a recession. \nBut while a temporary sigh of relief may be warranted, there\u2019s reason for concern about longer-term economic prospects. In a presentation at the conference, Eberly argued that just getting back to business-as-usual won\u2019t be enough to jolt the U.S. economy out of the sluggish growth trajectory it had been on pre-pandemic. The U.S.\u2019s aging population, as well as global conflicts and changes to trade patterns, pose serious challenges to productivity that must be overcome to boost long-term growth. Top candidates for increasing productivity in the long term include AI, increased levels of immigration, and hybrid or remote work arrangements that keep people in the workforce.\nYou can read the whole article in \nThe Wall Street Journal\n.\nFamily matters\nBy some estimates, 90 percent of businesses are family-owned. And while few are as consistently Shakespearean as the fictional Roy family of HBO\u2019s \nSuccession\n, many have to navigate complex family dynamics in the immediate term to set themselves up for success in the distant future.\n\u201cFamily businesses need to focus on long-term resilience, which means preparing the next generation,\u201d says \nMatt Allen\n, a clinical professor at Kellogg and executive director of the \nJohn L. Ward Center for Family Enterprises\n. \u201cThat\u2019s a different time horizon than quarterly earnings.\u201d\nIn \na recent \nKellogg Insight\n article\n, Allen offered some tips on how family enterprises can build and preserve multigenerational resilience. \nFor example: don\u2019t delay planning for a leadership transition. \nIf everyone knows a decade in advance who will take the helm, the entire organization can prepare accordingly. \u201cWhat works terribly is saying, \u2018We\u2019ve got three kids and we\u2019re not quite sure who will be taking over,\u2019\u201d Allen says.\nIn addition to transparency and a measure of continuity, the value of choosing early is that the new leader will have time to build their own relationship with employees and customers, Allen notes: \u201cWhen you have a date already set and a ten-year window to work with, that makes everyone comfortable.\u201d\nYou can read the rest of his advice in \nKellogg Insight\n.\n\u201cWe\u2019re finally at the point where the regulator is willing to give us clear guidance in terms of what\u2019s legal and what\u2019s not.\u201d\n\u2014 Clinical professor of strategy \nSarit Markovich\n, on \nNPR\n, on the Security and Exchange Commission\u2019s approval of exchange-traded funds that will track bitcoin prices.\nSee you next week!\nSusie Allen, senior research editor\nKellogg Insight\n\u00a0 \nYou should follow us on \nTwitter\n or \nLinkedIn\n.\nAnd listen to our \npodcasts\n.\nFeedback\n \u00a0\u00b7\u00a0 \nUnsubscribe\n \u00a0\u00b7\u00a0 \nAbout Us\n\u00a9 Kellogg School of Management, Northwestern University.",

To me, the beginning of the new year is the ideal time to update your current recruiting practices and add a few new simple tools that require little training and no budget. To support the updating effort of recruiters and hiring managers, below, you will find my top five recruiting tools articles from last year. Each of the ranked articles has a short summary covering why you should use it and a hyperlink to the complete article.\nDr. Sullivan\u2019s Must-Read Recruiting Tool Articles From 2023\nOf the more than 50 articles that I published last year, here are the top five most often read recruiting tools articles (ranked by LinkedIn impressions).\u00a0\nThe 5 worst candidate assessment tools that you should stop using\u00a0\n\u2013 this powerful article lists and describes the five worst candidate screening tools that are still commonly used. It utilizes data to question common screening approaches like Myers-Briggs and candidate fit. So, if you want to stop the premature screening out of top candidates and improve your overall recruiting results. Click on this link to learn more about\u00a0\nthe worst screening tools\n\u00a0that you should no longer be using.\nShift to \u201cprofessional conversations\u201d to reduce the stress that occurs in traditional\n\u00a0\ninterviews\n\u00a0\u2013 this article highlights how excessive stress can dramatically reduce the interview performance of even the best candidates. And it suggests you should instead shift to professional conversations. These are less threatening because they strive to reduce it by turning an interview into a more informal conversation between two professionals. So, if you want to see more of the \u201creal candidate\u201d during your interviews. Click here to learn more about these proven\u00a0\nprofessional conversations\n.\nDocumenting your interviews will improve your recruiting results\n\u00a0\u2013 few realize how this simple effort to more completely document your interviews can dramatically improve your hiring. This easy-to-scan article highlights how simple actions (like documenting each interviewer\u2019s numerical score) can help you identify your strongest interviewers. And how, over time, this documentation will help you to continually improve your hiring results. Click here to learn more about\u00a0\nthe value of better interview documentation\n.\nEncourage interview screeners to stop initially searching for weaknesses in candidate resumes \u2013\n\u00a0this article highlights how many resume screeners overly focus on finding candidate weaknesses so that they can quickly reduce their intimidating stack of resumes. However, that search for weaknesses can be delayed or moderated. You will find that most excellent candidates and all innovators have made missteps along the way in their careers. This means that it is better to first focus on finding \u201cpoints of excellence\u201d in a resume. In order to avoid hiring only vanilla candidates who have avoided mistakes by doing little. Click here to learn more about the problem of\u00a0\noverly focusing on weaknesses in resumes\n.\nWhy \u201chow will you solve this real problem\u201d is the most revealing interview\n\u00a0\nquestion\n\u00a0\u2013 it seems like everyone is constantly searching for the one \u201cmagic interview question.\u201d Well, if there is one. Fortunately, the data and my own experience reveal that the single most effective assessment tool is to put the candidate \u201cin the job.\u201d Unfortunately, that is difficult to do prior to hiring. However, you can come very close to \u201cputting them in the job\u201d during their interview by verbally giving the candidate \u201ca real problem that they will face in their job\u201d to solve during the interview. Fortunately, by asking them \u201cto walk you through the steps\u201d on how they will solve this problem.\u201d You can better determine if they will take the right steps and which important ones they will omit when they actually face this real problem. These \u201creal problem-solving type of questions\u201d will by far give the interviewer the most insight into whether the candidate can actually do this job.

Therefore, in my view, this is the most important article that all progressive hiring managers and recruiters should both read and follow. It is:\nTime your hiring when the competition is low \u2013\n\u00a0my research has revealed that the most ignored but highest impact area in recruiting is timing. Because almost everyone begins recruiting immediately after a job comes open, that can be a major mistake. Obviously, you have a better chance of recruiting top candidates when you recruit during the times of year when the hiring competition is extremely low. For example, few major talent competitors actively recruit during Christmas or August when their hiring managers are mostly distracted or are on vacation. So this article highlights how to identify the times during the year when even companies with tiny recruiting budgets and a weak employer brand can successfully recruit top talent during times when this talent has fewer choices. Simply because the major recruiting companies were doing little or no recruiting during that time. Click here to learn more about\u00a0\nthe importance of timing your hiring\n\u00a0when the competition is low.\nMy Editor\u2019s Selection\u2026 The Most Impactful Recruiting Tool For 2023\nAmong the dozens of articles on recruiting tools that I published during 2023, my wickedly smart editor, Michael Cox, selected this article as the most impactful.\u00a0\nA simple \u201cwhat worked survey\u201d quickly improves sourcing\u00a0\n\u2013 this article highlights the importance of applying a \u201cwhat worked survey\u201d of applicants and candidates. In order to learn the most effective job posting channels, the most powerful attraction factors and the strongest employer brand factors. Once you have applicant feedback data revealing these factors, you can quickly and easily improve your candidate sourcing. Click here to learn more about\u00a0\nthis simple survey for identifying what worked\n\u00a0and what didn\u2019t work during sourcing.\u00a0\nFinal Thoughts\nIn a fast-changing world, where AI and Quantum Computing will literally change everything that we do in business and recruiting. Continuous, self-directed, rapid learning will be the key to survival in almost every professional job. So rather than fight it, prepare for it by developing a plan for continuously learning about emerging recruiting tools and best practices.\nThe remainder of my fifty-plus 2023 articles and over 1,300 additional articles covering strategic talent management and aggressive recruiting 155\u2019s tools can be found at\u00a0\nwww.drjohnsullivan.com\n.

    "body": "Plus: the cost of hiring difficulties and the value of teaching empathy. \nThe virtue of having fewer opinions \u00a0\u00b7\u00a0 \nView in browser\n \nThe Insightful Leader\nBY \nKELLOGG INSIGHT\nLeadership advice from the Kellogg School of Management at Northwestern University\nGood morning,\nPineapple on pizza: innovation or abomination? Coffee or tea? Bears or Packers? Heck, I don\u2019t even follow football, and I kind of have an opinion on that last one (which I will \nnot\n share, because I\u2019m not out here trying to lose half my readers in the first paragraph).\nPoint is, modern life forces us into a funny corner where we\u2019re all reflexively forming opinions\u2014even about things that don\u2019t matter much to us. This week, we\u2019ll hear about the virtues of having fewer opinions. Then we\u2019ll explore some new research that quantifies the impact of job vacancies on a company.\nA matter of opinion\nOver on \nLinkedIn\n, \nAdam Waytz\n, a professor of management and organizations at Kellogg, had an idea for an unexpected New Year\u2019s resolution: try to develop fewer opinions. Once a position is formed, Waytz writes, \u201cit can become an unwanted responsibility, an annoyance, or worse, a stimulus for conflict with those who hold different opinions.\u201d In fact, after quitting Facebook and Twitter, Waytz found that the biggest upside was not having more time, but rather having fewer judgments to manage. When you don\u2019t know about the latest tempests in teapots, you don\u2019t have to decide how to feel about them.\n \nAnd the real problem with opinions, Waytz explains, is that we form them really easily\u2014and then start fighting about them. His own research has shown that our brains process seemingly trivial opinions (e.g., \u201cwaffle cones make ice cream taste better\u201d) and politically charged moral beliefs (e.g., \u201cbuying clothing made with sweatshop labor is morally unacceptable\u201d or \u201cAmericans are ethically obligated to buy American cars\u201d) in similar ways.\n\u201cProcessing these pure opinions and moral beliefs (compared to considering factual statements) recruited brain regions involved in thinking about the self and the social world,\u201d he writes. This suggests that opinions are powerful in part \u201cbecause they reflect something about the self and what others think about us.\u201d\nAnd sure, debating some opinions can be fun. (To return to our very first question, I do, personally, \nlove\n pineapple on pizza and have engaged in many enthusiastic discussions about the overall merits of savory/sweet combos. Dip a fry into a milkshake and tell me I\u2019m wrong!) \nBut often, Waytz argues, such back-and-forth turns divisive and downright exhausting: \u201cThat so much of modern life is spent on digital platforms that ask us to upvote, downvote, subscribe, cancel, and provide a rating has further pushed us into a collective state of \nopinion fatigue\n.\u201d His advice? \u201cSurrender some of your likes and dislikes, and experience the freedom that comes with it.\u201d\nYou can read his \nentire post here\n.\nHow vacancies affect the bottom line\nWe all know that job vacancies cause headaches\u2014your remaining workers are covering someone else\u2019s responsibilities, your managers are spending their days sorting through a big stack of r\u00e9sum\u00e9s instead of taking care of everything else they\u2019re supposed to be doing, and productivity suffers. But quantifying precisely how much empty positions hurt firms financially is surprisingly tricky. That\u2019s because most data about recruiting difficulties come from small-scale surveys, which researchers can\u2019t easily match with information about the health of individual firms.\nA new study by \nMaddalena Ronchi\n, an assistant professor of finance, tackles this challenge by analyzing job-posting data from the French government. Ronchi and her coauthors found that doubling the time it takes to fill a job vacancy results in a 3 percent drop in profits; a company facing the average amount of hiring difficulty can expect a 5 percent drop in sales. And it\u2019s not just already-ailing companies that are vulnerable to these effects. \u201cEven productive, large, growing firms are negatively affected by this type of [hiring] friction,\u201d Ronchi says. \u201cIf anything, even more so.\u201d\nYou can read more about the study in \nKellogg Insight\n.\n\u201cDisagreement means richness of point of view, a wealth of ideas. So we want to keep that. But we want to prepare people to listen to different points of view.\u201d\n\u2014 Kellogg dean \nFrancesca Cornelli\n, on \nLinkedIn\u2019s This Is Working podcast\n, on the importance of teaching empathy.\nSee you next week!\nSusie Allen, senior research editor\nKellogg Insight\n\u00a0 \nYou should follow us on \nTwitter\n or \nLinkedIn\n.\nAnd listen to our \npodcasts\n.\nFeedback\n \u00a0\u00b7\u00a0 \nUnsubscribe\n \u00a0\u00b7\u00a0 \nAbout Us\n\u00a9 Kellogg School of Management, Northwestern University.",

Along the way, participants will be given the opportunity to examine their own experiences with emotion labor and reflect on their own more and less effective strategies for managing emotion labor. Participants might be interested in reading\u00a0\nThe Burnout Spiral: The Emotion Labor of Five Rural U.S. Foreign Language Teachers\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\nand/or listen to this\u00a0\n\u00a0\npodcast\n\u00a0\non emotion labor in preparation for the webinar; however, it is not required in order to fully benefit from the webinar.\n\u00a0\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nKris Acheson-Clair\nFormerly Georgia State University faculty and Fulbright Scholar to Honduras, Kris is a well-published scholar on intercultural competence, transformative learning theory, emotion labor, and assessment. Kris currently serves as director of Purdue University\u2019s Center for Intercultural Learning, Mentorship, Assessment, and Research (CILMAR). Under her leadership, CILMAR works with the university\u2019s faculty and staff both to put intercultural learning at the heart of study abroad and virtual exchange programs and to embed intercultural learning across the curriculum and student life in order to reach the entire campus. Kris and CILMAR also serve the field of international education by creating scalable experiential and reflective teaching materials, producing cutting-edge scholarship, offering professional development opportunities, and connecting people and resources in the Intercultural Learning Hub (\nhubicl.org\n).\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n \n \nAnnette Benson\nSince 2003, Annette Benson has served in a variety of administrative roles at Purdue University, including oversight of an ESOL program, HR training in diversity and inclusion, creation of integration and intercultural learning programs, management of the Intercultural Learning Hub, and public relations for the burgeoning CILMAR. Annette holds a Master of Science degree in strategic communication from Purdue\u2019s Brian Lamb School of Communication. She comments that one of the kindest things a supervisor ever did for her was to discuss emotion labor with her.\n\u00a0\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nNon-member Register \n \n \n \n \n \n \nUnsubscribe\n | Sent by SIETAR USA \n4880 Lower Roswell Rd, Suite 165 \u2022 Marietta , GA \u2022 30068",

    "body": "Plus: accepting advice and measuring ad efficacy. \nWhen perks come with a price \u00a0\u00b7\u00a0 \nView in browser\n \nThe Insightful Leader\nBY \nKELLOGG INSIGHT\nLeadership advice from the Kellogg School of Management at Northwestern University\nHappy New Year!\nI did some traveling over the holidays. Naturally, the minute I got back, I started thinking about my \nnext\n vacation. Destination: anywhere warmer and sunnier than Chicago right now. \nAnd like a lot of us, I wondered whether I could somehow game my credit-card rewards to snag a free trip. \nBut new research from \nLulu Wang\n, an assistant professor of finance, shows that these kinds of credit-card perks are actually costing us all. This week, we\u2019ll explain where all the freebies are coming from and why they aren\u2019t actually free. We\u2019ll also share some advice from Kellogg\u2019s associate dean of digital innovation, \nMohanbir Sawhney\n, on the art of accepting advice.\nNot so rewarding?\nWhy is it that credit-card companies seem so eager to give certain customers airline miles and cash back?\n \nWang\u2019s research shows that rewards are one of the best ways for credit-card companies to compete for customers. After all, as consumers, we have lots of choices about how to pay; rewards help companies achieve that coveted \u201ctop of wallet\u201d status. \nThe difficulty, however, is that credit-card companies fund rewards through the fees they charge to merchants. And in the U.S., those fees have gotten very high: about 2.2 percent of the total transaction cost, on average.\nFaced with higher fees, merchants can either raise prices, which affects customers directly. Or they simply eat the cost\u2014which makes them more likely to struggle and close. \u201cConsumers also take a hit from that, even if it isn\u2019t in the prices of goods that they\u2019re buying,\u201d Wang says. \u201cThere\u2019s one fewer coffee shop to go to or one fewer nice seller of clarinets.\u201d\nIt\u2019s also worth remembering that lots of Americans don\u2019t have incomes or credit scores that provide access to the most desirable credit cards. This means that debit-card and cash users, who tend to be lower income, are essentially paying for the credit rewards enjoyed by wealthier Americans.\nSo, can the system be improved?\nWang\u2019s study uses mathematical modeling to test several commonly proposed methods of doing just that. Capping merchant fees, as well as encouraging more debit-card usage, would be \u201cthe most robust policy,\u201d he says.\nMeanwhile, for consumers trying to decide how to feel about using rewards credit cards, Wang says there are no easy answers.\n\u201cThe rational consumer response is, do whatever makes sense for your own financial health and get the rewards if you want,\u201d he says. \u201cThe ethicist might say something like, would you be willing to put $100 in your pocket by stealing a penny from 10,000 people?\u201d\nYou can read more about Wang\u2019s research \nhere\n.\nWords of wisdom\nOver on \nLinkedIn\n, Mohanbir Sawhney, who is also a clinical professor of marketing, had some great tips on receiving \u201cthe gift of advice.\u201d (Psst, you can \nfollow \nKellogg Insight\n on LinkedIn\n, too. That\u2019s \nmy\n advice for today.) \nHere are a few of his recommendations:\n\u201cWould you be open to changing your course of action based on the advice you might get? If the answer is a firm no, then don\u2019t take advice! Readiness to embrace advice means taking advice with the intent to understand and possibly act upon it.\n\u201cGet enough advice so that you have a variety of perspectives and diversity of opinions, but not so much advice from so many people that you get confused and overwhelmed. More advice is not always better.\n\u201cAfter collecting advice, spend time to reflect. Synthesize the advice with your knowledge and values. Then, listen to your gut to decide the course of action. This will ensure that your actions combine the perspectives of advisors with your values and your goals.\u201d\nYou can read the whole post \nhere\n.\n\u201cAdvertisers fundamentally want to know what happens to somebody who sees the ad compared to somebody who doesn\u2019t.\u201d\n\u2014 Professor of marketing \nFlorian Zettelmeyer\n, in \nKellogg Insight\n, on the challenge of measuring digital ad efficacy.\nSee you next week!\nSusie Allen, senior research editor\nKellogg Insight\n\u00a0 \nYou should follow us on \nTwitter\n or \nLinkedIn\n.\nAnd listen to our \npodcasts\n.\nFeedback\n \u00a0\u00b7\u00a0 \nUnsubscribe\n \u00a0\u00b7\u00a0 \nAbout Us\n\u00a9 Kellogg School of Management, Northwestern University.",
