Denial\nExample scenario:\n A Baby Boomer manager dismisses the work-life balance concerns of Millennial employees as simply \"not having a strong work ethic.\"\nWhat's happening:\n The manager fails to recognize the legitimate cultural differences in how generations view work, instead attributing differences to character flaws. They might say, \"When I was their age, we just worked hard without complaining. These kids today just want everything handed to them.\"\n2. Polarization\nExample scenario:\n Gen Z employees form an informal coalition and openly criticize older colleagues for being \"out of touch\" with technology and social trends.\nWhat's happening:\n The younger employees have created an \"us vs. them\" dynamic, judging the older workers negatively based on generational stereotypes. They might express frustration like, \"The Boomers are holding us back with their outdated ideas\u2014they need to retire already\" (Defense), or conversely, \"The older generation's approach to in-person relationship building is so much more authentic than our digital connections\" (Reversal).\n3. Minimization\nExample scenario:\n \nA Gen X team leader says, \"Age doesn't matter in our workplace\u2014we're all just professionals trying to do our jobs well.\"\nWhat's happening:\n While seemingly inclusive, this perspective masks important generational differences in communication styles, work preferences, and values. The team leader is emphasizing universal qualities (\"we're all professionals\") while unintentionally invalidating the unique perspectives and challenges each generation brings to the workplace.\n4. Acceptance\nExample scenario:\n A Millennial project manager acknowledges that different generations have distinct approaches to collaboration and deliberately creates mixed-generation teams to capitalize on diverse perspectives.\nWhat's happening:\n The manager recognizes that Baby Boomers might prefer scheduled meetings and formal documentation, Gen X values independence and efficiency, and Gen Z excels with digital collaboration tools. Rather than judging these differences, the manager respects them as valid cultural variations and designs team processes that accommodate different styles.\n5. Adaptation\nExample scenario:\n A leadership team composed of multiple generations develops a flexible workplace policy that incorporates elements appealing to all age groups.\nWhat's happening:\n The policy includes structured career paths (appealing to Boomers), autonomous work arrangements (valued by Gen X), purpose-driven projects (important to Millennials), and tech-enabled collaboration with rapid feedback (preferred by Gen Z). Leaders shift their communication styles based on their audience\u2014using more formal channels with older employees and more digital platforms with younger staff\u2014while helping different generations translate for each other.\nIn the Adaptation stage, there might be a mentoring program where older employees share institutional knowledge and younger employees provide reverse mentoring on digital skills, creating a genuinely collaborative multigenerational workplace where differences are leveraged as strengths rather than seen as obstacles.",

    "body": "Tell me what you think about these for the IDI slide.\nIntercultural Development Inventory Stages in Workplace Generational Interactions\nHere are examples of how the five IDI stages might manifest when dealing with different generations in the workplace:\n1. Denial\nExample scenario:\n A Baby Boomer manager dismisses the work-life balance concerns of Millennial employees as simply \"not having a strong work ethic.\"\nWhat's happening:\n The manager fails to recognize the legitimate cultural differences in how generations view work, instead attributing differences to character flaws. They might say, \"When I was their age, we just worked hard without complaining. These kids today just want everything handed to them.\"\n2. Polarization\nExample scenario:\n Gen Z employees form an informal coalition and openly criticize older colleagues for being \"out of touch\" with technology and social trends.\nWhat's happening:\n The younger employees have created an \"us vs. them\" dynamic, judging the older workers negatively based on generational stereotypes. They might express frustration like, \"The Boomers are holding us back with their outdated ideas\u2014they need to retire already\" (Defense), or conversely, \"The older generation's approach to in-person relationship building is so much more authentic than our digital connections\" (Reversal).\n3. Minimization\nExample scenario:\n \nA Gen X team leader says, \"Age doesn't matter in our workplace\u2014we're all just professionals trying to do our jobs well.\"\nWhat's happening:\n While seemingly inclusive, this perspective masks important generational differences in communication styles, work preferences, and values. The team leader is emphasizing universal qualities (\"we're all professionals\") while unintentionally invalidating the unique perspectives and challenges each generation brings to the workplace.\n4. Acceptance\nExample scenario:\n A Millennial project manager acknowledges that different generations have distinct approaches to collaboration and deliberately creates mixed-generation teams to capitalize on diverse perspectives.\nWhat's happening:\n The manager recognizes that Baby Boomers might prefer scheduled meetings and formal documentation, Gen X values independence and efficiency, and Gen Z excels with digital collaboration tools. Rather than judging these differences, the manager respects them as valid cultural variations and designs team processes that accommodate different styles.\n5. Adaptation\nExample scenario:\n A leadership team composed of multiple generations develops a flexible workplace policy that incorporates elements appealing to all age groups.\nWhat's happening:\n The policy includes structured career paths (appealing to Boomers), autonomous work arrangements (valued by Gen X), purpose-driven projects (important to Millennials), and tech-enabled collaboration with rapid feedback (preferred by Gen Z). Leaders shift their communication styles based on their audience\u2014using more formal channels with older employees and more digital platforms with younger staff\u2014while helping different generations translate for each other.\nIn the Adaptation stage, there might be a mentoring program where older employees share institutional knowledge and younger employees provide reverse mentoring on digital skills, creating a genuinely collaborative multigenerational workplace where differences are leveraged as strengths rather than seen as obstacles.",

I've noticed you tend to use casual language and abbreviations that some of our more traditional clients might not understand.\nTyler:\n Yeah, I get that. I guess I'm just communicating how I normally would. Is it really that big of a deal?\nPatricia:\n In some contexts, it can be. Many of our established clients expect a certain level of formality. It signals professionalism to them.\nTyler:\n That's interesting. I actually find that being authentic and speaking naturally helps me build better connections. My generation values authenticity over formality.\nPatricia:\n I appreciate that perspective. Perhaps we can find a middle ground. Could you consider adjusting your style for certain clients while maintaining your authentic approach with others?\nTyler:\n I could definitely be more mindful of my audience. Maybe you could help me identify which clients might prefer more formal communication?\nPatricia:\n That's a great solution. I'll share my insights about our client preferences, and perhaps you could teach me some of the more effective casual communication techniques that work well with younger clients.\nTyler:\n I'd be happy to! I think we could both learn from each other's strengths here.\nScenario 2: Millennial Manager & Boomer Employee\nContext:\n Financial services firm \nTopic:\n Adapting to technological changes \nCharacters:\n Jessica (38, Millennial, Team Lead) and Robert (62, Baby Boomer, Financial Analyst)\nConversation:\nJessica:\n Robert, I've noticed you're still using the old spreadsheet method for client data analysis rather than the new CRM system we implemented last month.\nRobert:\n The spreadsheet system has worked perfectly fine for the past 15 years. I can get the same results without having to learn an entirely new system.\nJessica:\n I understand you've developed efficient systems over your career. However, the new CRM offers features that significantly speed up analysis and allows for better team collaboration.\nRobert:\n I've built my career on accuracy and thoroughness. I'm concerned that rushing to adopt new technology might compromise that quality.\nJessica:\n I deeply respect your commitment to quality. What if we approach this as an opportunity to combine your analytical expertise with new tools that can enhance what you already do well?\nRobert:\n I suppose I've been resisting because I'm worried about the learning curve. At this stage in my career, starting from scratch feels challenging.\nJessica:\n That's a valid concern. What if I arranged for one-on-one training sessions? Your experience is incredibly valuable to our team, and combining that with new technological capabilities would be powerful.\nRobert:\n I appreciate you recognizing that. I'm willing to give it a try with proper support. Perhaps I could also document some of the analytical approaches I've developed that might be integrated into the new system.\nJessica:\n That would be excellent! Your expertise could help us customize the CRM to better serve our specific needs.\nScenario 3: Gen X Colleagues of Different Racial Backgrounds\nContext:\n University administration \nTopic:\n Inclusive leadership and cultural awareness \nCharacters:\n Marcus (48, Black, Associate Dean) and Diane (45, White, Department Chair)\nConversation:\nMarcus:\n Diane, I wanted to discuss something I observed in yesterday's faculty meeting. When Professor Johnson, who is Korean American, was speaking about her research, she was interrupted several times.\nDiane:\n I noticed that too, but I wasn't sure if I should step in. I sometimes worry about overstepping or making assumptions about what others might need.\nMarcus:\n I understand that concern. As leaders in our department, though, I think we need to be more proactive about ensuring everyone's voice is heard equally.\nDiane:\n You're right. I realize I may have hesitated because I'm sometimes unsure about how to address these moments without making them more awkward. How do you approach these situations?\nMarcus:\n For me, it's about establishing clear meeting norms from the beginning. I've found that simple statements like \"Let's make sure we hear everyone's complete thoughts before responding\" can make a difference.\nDiane:\n That's helpful. I think I also need to become more comfortable with the discomfort that can come with addressing these moments directly.\nMarcus:\n Absolutely. And from my experience as a Black man in academia, I can tell you that the discomfort of having someone interrupt these patterns is far less than the discomfort of being repeatedly interrupted or overlooked.\nDiane:\n That's an important perspective I hadn't fully considered. I'd appreciate your feedback as I work on being more proactive. Maybe we could collaborate on developing some departmental guidelines for inclusive discussions?\nMarcus:\n I'd be happy to work on that together. By combining our different perspectives and experiences, we could create something that really addresses the needs of our diverse faculty.\nScenario 4: Gen Z Manager & Millennial Employee\nContext:\n Tech startup \nTopic:\n Work-life boundaries and productivity \nCharacters:\n Zoe (27, Gen Z, Product Manager) and Miguel (35, Millennial, Software Developer)\nConversation:\nZoe:\n Miguel, I noticed you've been responding to Slack messages at midnight and sending emails on weekends. I'm concerned about potential burnout.\nMiguel:\n I appreciate your concern, but I'm just trying to stay on top of everything. This project is important, and I want to make sure we meet our deadlines.\nZoe:\n I understand the commitment to the project, but our company values sustainable productivity. We don't expect people to be available 24/7.\nMiguel:\n In my previous companies, responsiveness was highly valued. It showed dedication to the job.\nZoe:\n That's interesting. For my generation, we've seen the negative effects of always-on culture. Research shows that proper rest actually improves overall productivity and creativity.\nMiguel:\n I guess I'm still carrying expectations from previous workplace cultures. Sometimes I worry that if I'm not constantly available, it might seem like I'm not committed enough.\nZoe:\n Your commitment is evident in the quality of your work, not in when you respond to messages. What if we establish some team agreements about communication hours?\nMiguel:\n That could help set clearer expectations. To be honest, it would be nice to disconnect more without feeling guilty.\nZoe:\n Exactly. Let's work together to define what healthy boundaries look like for our team. Your experience is valuable, and I want to make sure you're set up for long-term success here, not just short-term output.\nMiguel:\n I appreciate that. It's actually refreshing to have a manager who prioritizes wellbeing alongside performance.\nScenario 5: Gen X Manager & Gen Alpha Intern\nContext:\n Environmental nonprofit \nTopic:\n Professional communication and expectations \nCharacters:\n Lisa (44, Gen X, Program Director) and Aiden (16, Gen Alpha, Summer Intern)\nConversation:\nLisa:\n Aiden, I wanted to check in about your first few weeks with us. How are you finding the experience?\nAiden:\n It's been cool! I really like the mission. But sometimes I'm not sure what I'm supposed to be doing or if I'm doing things right.\nLisa:\n Thanks for sharing that. Could you tell me more about where you're feeling uncertain?\nAiden:\n Well, like yesterday when you asked me to \"circle back\" with the volunteers, I wasn't really sure what that meant. And sometimes I feel like I should be doing more, but I don't want to mess anything up.\nLisa:\n I see. I should be more clear with my instructions and avoid jargon. \"Circling back\" just means following up with them about their availability.\nAiden:\n That makes sense. Also, is it okay to message you with questions? I use messaging apps for everything, but I'm not sure what's professional.\nLisa:\n Great question. For quick clarifications, messaging is perfect. For more complex discussions or anything involving program decisions, I'd prefer we talk in person or schedule a video call.\nAiden:\n Got it. That helps a lot.\nLisa:\n I'm curious - what methods of communication do you find most effective?\nAiden:\n I like how we use different channels for different types of communication here. But maybe having some examples of professional messages would help me understand the expectations better.\nLisa:\n That's an excellent suggestion. I can put together some templates and examples. And Aiden, please know that asking questions is exactly what you should be doing as an intern. It shows engagement and a desire to learn.\nAiden:\n Thanks! I'm really excited to learn how things work in a professional environment. It's pretty different from school.\nLisa:\n That's why internships are so valuable. And I appreciate your digital fluency \u2013 it brings a fresh perspective to our team. Let's set up a quick check-in meeting each week to address any questions and make sure you're getting the most out of this experience.",

To be honest, it would be nice to disconnect more without feeling guilty.\nZoe:\n Exactly. Let's work together to define what healthy boundaries look like for our team. Your experience is valuable, and I want to make sure you're set up for long-term success here, not just short-term output.\nMiguel:\n I appreciate that. It's actually refreshing to have a manager who prioritizes wellbeing alongside performance.\nScenario 5: Gen X Manager & Gen Alpha Intern\nContext:\n Environmental nonprofit \nTopic:\n Professional communication and expectations \nCharacters:\n Lisa (44, Gen X, Program Director) and Aiden (16, Gen Alpha, Summer Intern)\nConversation:\nLisa:\n Aiden, I wanted to check in about your first few weeks with us. How are you finding the experience?\nAiden:\n It's been cool! I really like the mission. But sometimes I'm not sure what I'm supposed to be doing or if I'm doing things right.\nLisa:\n Thanks for sharing that. Could you tell me more about where you're feeling uncertain?\nAiden:\n Well, like yesterday when you asked me to \"circle back\" with the volunteers, I wasn't really sure what that meant. And sometimes I feel like I should be doing more, but I don't want to mess anything up.\nLisa:\n I see. I should be more clear with my instructions and avoid jargon. \"Circling back\" just means following up with them about their availability.\nAiden:\n That makes sense. Also, is it okay to message you with questions? I use messaging apps for everything, but I'm not sure what's professional.\nLisa:\n Great question. For quick clarifications, messaging is perfect. For more complex discussions or anything involving program decisions, I'd prefer we talk in person or schedule a video call.\nAiden:\n Got it. That helps a lot.\nLisa:\n I'm curious - what methods of communication do you find most effective?\nAiden:\n I like how we use different channels for different types of communication here. But maybe having some examples of professional messages would help me understand the expectations better.\nLisa:\n That's an excellent suggestion. I can put together some templates and examples. And Aiden, please know that asking questions is exactly what you should be doing as an intern. It shows engagement and a desire to learn.\nAiden:\n Thanks! I'm really excited to learn how things work in a professional environment. It's pretty different from school.\nLisa:\n That's why internships are so valuable. And I appreciate your digital fluency \u2013 it brings a fresh perspective to our team. Let's set up a quick check-in meeting each week to address any questions and make sure you're getting the most out of this experience.",

However, it's important to acknowledge that a significant majority of leaders remain committed to advancing inclusion, albeit with increased strategic consideration.\nTo ensure the continued effectiveness and legal defensibility of our DEI programs, we are focusing on:\nLegal Compliance:\n Rigorously auditing our initiatives using established frameworks to mitigate potential legal risks.\nRisk Analysis:\n Evaluating the potential consequences of pausing DEI efforts, including impacts on employee engagement, innovation, and legal standing.\nInternal Communication:\n Reaffirming our commitment to DEI as a core business imperative and cultural value within our organization.\n\u200b\nRead more in my Forbes article here\n.\n \nThanks allies,\nJulie\n\u200b\n\ud83d\udcac \nAllyship Conversation Starters & Resources\n\u200b\nHow to Build Career Resilience in Uncertain Times\n\u200b\n\u200b\n\u200b\n\u200b\n \n\u200b\nBeyond DEI: Understanding Public Opinion on Diversity, Equity, & Inclusion\n\u200b\n\u200b\n\u200b\n \nCare about inclusion for the little ones in your life?

    "body": "Plus: why small firms pass up valuable opportunities. \nApril 2, 2025 \u00a0\u00b7\u00a0 \nView in browser\n \nThe Insightful Leader\nBY \nKELLOGG INSIGHT\nLeadership advice from the Kellogg School of Management at Northwestern University\nGood morning,\nThe transition from individual contributor to first-time manager is a notoriously bumpy ride that requires you to use a muscle you (probably) weren\u2019t trained to flex: helping others grow.\nThis week, \nHarry Kraemer\n, a clinical professor of management and organizations at Kellogg and former chairman and CEO of Baxter International, shares tips to help fledgling leaders stick the landing. \nPlus, what makes small businesses hesitant to take advantage of simple opportunities to improve their bottom line? \nA more-successful transition into management\nIn his 40 years in business, Kraemer\u2019s seen new leaders fall into some of the same traps: they micromanage instead of delegating because they\u2019re more comfortable doing everything themselves, for example. And they\u2019re often so focused on being seen as \u201cirreplaceable\u201d that they end up overshadowing their teams. Unfortunately, Kraemer writes, someone who is irreplaceable in a role is not likely to be promoted out of it.\nKraemer writes that the struggles of first-time managers should be a wake-up call for more-experienced leaders to step up and support them. He offers several tips to that end.\n \nFirst, be a values-based leader, which means constantly reflecting on what matters most so that you can have a positive impact on others. Kraemer\u2019s approach to values-based leadership is anchored in four principles: self-reflection, a balanced perspective, true self-confidence, and genuine humility. \nSelf-reflection is particularly important because it can help you better understand your own priorities and what matters most to you. \n\u201cIf you are not self-reflective, how can you know yourself; and if you do not know yourself, how can you lead yourself? And if you cannot lead yourself, how can you possibly lead others?\u201d Kraemer writes.\nAnother tip for aspiring leaders is to understand that you don\u2019t\u2014and can\u2019t\u2014know everything. Gathering input can provide you with a more balanced perspective and help you correct for blindspots. \n\u201cThis applies to gathering input from others on the best way to tackle a project, as well as to engage with people who hold different and contradictory views, especially in today\u2019s \npolarized world\n,\u201d Kramer writes. \nRead more from Kraemer in \nForbes\n.\nWhy small firms pass up valuable opportunities\nSean Higgins\n's recent research grew out of a surprising observation: small businesses don\u2019t always take advantage of simple opportunities to improve their bottom line.\nHiggins, a Kellogg associate professor of finance, was consulting with a Mexico-based fintech company that charged merchants a fee for credit-card-payment processing. When a competitor had begun offering a lower fee, the fintech company wanted to test lowering its own fee as well. \n\u201cThe idea was to shift some customers to card payments by making those payments cheap enough to offset the indirect costs of using cash, like having to handle it and go to the bank frequently,\u201d Higgins says.\nBut when he helped the company run a pilot study that offered the lower fee to about 11,000 merchants, only about 15 percent opted in. \nThe result motivated Higgins and collaborators Paul Gertler and Ulrike Malmendier of UC Berkeley and Waldo Ojeda of Columbia to study why small businesses hesitate to act. They designed an experiment to test whether behavioral frictions (such as forgetfulness or failing to think long term) could explain why businesses were resistant to taking certain actions that might benefit them. \nThey found that several tools significantly increased customers\u2019 likelihood of accepting the offer. Above all, \u201cpre-announced reminders had the largest impact,\u201d Higgins says.\n\u201cIt has something to do with the fintech company telling merchants on day one that the company is going to do something,\u201d he says, \u201cand then following through and actually doing it.\u201d\nRead more about the research in \nKellogg Insight\n.\n\u201cSince many banking services can be provided online, this will be disproportionately costly to those that have a harder time accessing or using online banking, relative to physical locations, such as the elderly or low-income households.\u201d\n\u2014 \nCarola Frydman\n, in \nNewsweek\n, on what the projected closure of hundreds of U.S. bank branches this year means for Americans.\nSee you next week,\nLaura Pavin, multimedia editor\nKellogg Insight\nFollow us on \nLinkedIn\n.\nAnd listen to our \npodcasts\n.\nKellogg School of Management\n | \n2211 Campus Drive\n, \nEvanston, IL 60208\n \nUnsubscribe larry@lcwmail.com\n \nUpdate Profile\n | \nConstant Contact Data Notice\n \nSent by \ninsight@kellogg.northwestern.edu",

Ignoring federal and academic research showing the success of hybrid and remote models, these policies risk damaging public service efficiency and triggering costly turnover\u2014just as seen under Biden\u2019s more moderate RTO approach.\nTo learn more, check out this \nblog\n.\nRead Blog\n \nPrefer video to text?

I will use the responses to inform my articles in \nHarvard Business Review\n, \nFortune\n, and \nEntrepreneur\n.\nYour Testimonials\nYou and others who gain value from Disaster Avoidance Experts \nservices\n and thought leadership occasionally share testimonials about your experience, such as the one below. You can read more testimonials \nhere\n.\n\"I highly recommend Dr. Gleb coming to your Vistage meeting because it was an outstanding presentation. \nIt was a presentation about really how you think, what kind of questions to ask, how to get through difficult situations.\n And the biggest thing we talk about at Vistage is decisions. After you leave this meeting, you're going to find out better ways of making decisions and the choices you make and the impact that it has on your business, your personal life, and your spiritual life.\"\n-\u200c \nChet Tart\n, Vistage Chair\nSchedule a Free Consultation\n \nWhat's Up With Me\nIt\u2019s a puzzle to me why so many things that appear to be solely data-informed become so politicized.\n Why did WFH grow so politicized, for example? It\u2019s not obvious at all that Republicans should favor government employees working in the office: after all, you can save a lot of money on real estate, as well as on hiring and retention costs, since people are willing to work for less and have better retention when they work remotely at least some of the time. Furthermore, productivity metrics and morale are higher when people can work remotely at least some of the time. But clearly, this issue did become politicized. Is it because of a lack of trust in public workers? Well, you can simply institute more clear accountability and tracking mechanisms, rather than forcing people back to the office, and losing all the benefits. It\u2019s a clear example where culture wars win out over good, common business sense.\u00a0\nWould love to get your feedback on what you found most useful about this edition of the \u201cWise Decision Maker Guide\u201d - simply reply to this email.\nDecisively Yours,\nDr. Gleb\nDr. Gleb Tsipursky\nCEO of Disaster Avoidance Experts\nPS: Are we connected on LinkedIn?

What if\u00a0I get labeled \"difficult\"?\nSo,\u00a0they stay silent. Again.\u00a0Now imagine this happening to employees across your organization, every single day.\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\ud83e\udd14\n The Experience:\u00a0\nFor many employees, especially those from underrepresented backgrounds, this is a daily reality.\nThey \nhold back\n, they \nmask their identity\n, they \nself-censor\n, not because they don\u2019t care\u2026but because the environment has taught them it\u2019s not safe to show up fully.\u00a0\nLeaders like you are doing the work\u2014you\u2019re committed to DEI, you\u2019ve launched initiatives, and built task forces. But without psychological safety, none of it sticks.\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u26a0\ufe0f\n The Problem:\u00a0\nWhen your team doesn\u2019t feel safe to speak up, challenge the status quo, or express themselves authentically, your organization suffers:\u00a0\nInnovation stalls.\u00a0\nEngagement declines.\u00a0\nDiverse talent quietly leaves.\u00a0\nInclusion becomes performative.\u00a0\nLack of psychological safety \nerodes trust\n, and with it, your DEI efforts lose their power. You\u2019re left managing programs that check boxes but don\u2019t change hearts.\n\u00a0\n\ud83d\udca1\n The Future You\u2019re Waiting For:\u00a0\nNow, picture this instead:\u00a0\nA culture where every employee\u2014regardless of role, identity, or background\u2014feels not just seen but \nsafe\n.\nWhere a Black employee challenges a policy without fear.\nWhere a trans team member can correct misgendering confidently.\nWhere junior staff raise bold ideas without worrying they\u2019ll be shut down.\u00a0\nThat\u2019s when DEI becomes more than a program\u2014it becomes \na lived experience\n.\u00a0\nAnd it starts with psychological safety.\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\ud83c\udfa4\n What\u2019s Next:\u00a0\nIn a few days, I\u2019ll be sending you \nPart 2\n, packed with specific, actionable strategies to build psychological safety in your workplace.\u00a0\nBecause inclusion can\u2019t survive without it\u2014and your people can\u2019t thrive without it.\u00a0\n\ud83d\udc49\n Watch your inbox for the next email.
