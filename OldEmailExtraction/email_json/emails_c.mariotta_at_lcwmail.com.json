No rush, but I need your help with the onboarding of new translators.\n\u00a0\nCan you look at the attached \"Translator-Interpreter Profile\" doc & lmk if you would need to send this to new translators you hire? It looks like a way to capture their bank info (which SG could get off their invoice or other ways). And, it looks like it helps you track their rates. Let me know if you think you need to use this doc and/or make any\u00a0changes to it.\n\u00a0\nI've also attached an email template I'm putting\u00a0together that you could s\nend to new translators to get what you need in terms of paperwork. I added a bunch of things in red I'm still working on. What else would you want to include in this doc? Do you need to share info about Trados here or anything else? Feel free to edit the doc.\n\u00a0\nI've also attached the updated Translator Agreement I am working on. Sending more of an FYI.\n\u00a0\nI know this is a lot. It's not a rush as I said. I'm just trying to help get you everything you need to send to new translators.\n\u00a0\nHappy to talk on thee phone about this another time too if easier.\n\u00a0\nThanks!\nFrom:\n Accounting <\naccounting@lcwmail.com\n>\nSent:\n Tuesday, April 1, 2025 6:01 PM\nTo:\n Nicole Barile <\nn.barile@lcwmail.com\n>\nCc:\n Cecilia Mariotta <\nc.mariotta@lcwmail.com\n>\nSubject:\n RE: Invoicing language in Translator Agreement\n \n\u00a0\nHi Nicole,\n\u00a0\nSo the way we currently pay vendors, in order of preference, is:\n\u00a0\nACH to a US bank account\nPayPal\n(international wire, but the service we use is currently unavailable due to their vendor issues \u2013 I am looking into other options)\n\u00a0\nWe don\u2019t send physical checks anymore, it\u2019s electronic only. For US bank accounts, I need the vendor to provide an email address, and then I will send them an invite to create a QuickBooks Money account to manage their information (or send me routing & account).

When you get a sec, can you please lmk if the below is still appropriate? I'm updating our Translation Agreement & think the below might be out of date. Thank you!\n\u00a0\n6.5. \u00a0LCW shall pay the Translator with a check drawn on a US bank (or with PayPal, if so requested by the translator) in US dollars (US$), within 30 days of receiving the invoice, unless agreed upon otherwise by both LCW and the Translator. All bank and processing fees for receiving the money are the responsibility of the translator.\n\u00a0\n6.6. \u00a0The Translator \nmay \nrequest payment via electronic funds transfer (wire transfer). In cases where the invoice amount exceeds US$1000.00, LCW will pay the outgoing wire transfer fees. For lesser amounts, the wire transfer may be requested by discounting the invoice by US$35.00 for international transfers and US$25 for domestic (US) transfers (the charge LCW incurs by initiating the wire transfer).\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\nNicole Barile\n\u00a0\n(She/Her)\nChief Operating Officer\nLCW\n\u00a0\nWebsite\n\u00a0\n|\n\u00a0\nTwitter\n\u00a0\n|\n\u00a0\nFacebook\n\u00a0\n|\n\u00a0\nLinkedIn\nView our upcoming events\n\u00a0| \nSign-up for our newsletter",

    "body": "Hi. No rush, but I need your help with the onboarding of new translators.\nCan you look at the attached \"Translator-Interpreter Profile\" doc & lmk if you would need to send this to new translators you hire? It looks like a way to capture their bank info (which SG could get off their invoice or other ways). And, it looks like it helps you track their rates. Let me know if you think you need to use this doc and/or make any\u00a0changes to it.\nI've also attached an email template I'm putting\u00a0together that you could send to new translators to get what you need in terms of paperwork. I added a bunch of things in red I'm still working on. What else would you want to include in this doc? Do you need to share info about Trados here or anything else? Feel free to edit the doc.\nI've also attached the updated Translator Agreement I am working on. Sending more of an FYI.\nI know this is a lot. It's not a rush as I said. I'm just trying to help get you everything you need to send to new translators.\nHappy to talk on thee phone about this another time too if easier.\nThanks!\nFrom:\n Accounting <accounting@lcwmail.com>\nSent:\n Tuesday, April 1, 2025 6:01 PM\nTo:\n Nicole Barile <n.barile@lcwmail.com>\nCc:\n Cecilia Mariotta <c.mariotta@lcwmail.com>\nSubject:\n RE: Invoicing language in Translator Agreement\n \n\u00a0\nHi Nicole,\n\u00a0\nSo the way we currently pay vendors, in order of preference, is:\n\u00a0\nACH to a US bank account\nPayPal\n(international wire, but the service we use is currently unavailable due to their vendor issues \u2013 I am looking into other options)\n\u00a0\nWe don\u2019t send physical checks anymore, it\u2019s electronic only. For US bank accounts, I need the vendor to provide an email address, and then I will send them an invite to create a QuickBooks Money account to manage their information (or send me routing & account). PayPal they just need to give me the email.\n\u00a0\nHope this is helpful, let me know if you need anything else \n\ud83d\ude0a\n\u00a0\nSG\n\u00a0\nFrom:\n Nicole Barile <n.barile@lcwmail.com> \nSent:\n Monday, March 31, 2025 16:01\nTo:\n Accounting <accounting@lcwmail.com>\nCc:\n Cecilia Mariotta <c.mariotta@lcwmail.com>\nSubject:\n Re: Invoicing language in Translator Agreement\n\u00a0\nHI again SG. I also found this old form (attached) that it seems we used to send to translators to get their banking info / payment preferences. Again, no rush, but can you also check if the attached is needed?

When you get a sec, can you please lmk if the below is still appropriate? I'm updating our Translation Agreement & think the below might be out of date. Thank you!\n\u00a0\n6.5. \u00a0LCW shall pay the Translator with a check drawn on a US bank (or with PayPal, if so requested by the translator) in US dollars (US$), within 30 days of receiving the invoice, unless agreed upon otherwise by both LCW and the Translator. All bank and processing fees for receiving the money are the responsibility of the translator.\n\u00a0\n6.6. \u00a0The Translator \nmay \nrequest payment via electronic funds transfer (wire transfer). In cases where the invoice amount exceeds US$1000.00, LCW will pay the outgoing wire transfer fees. For lesser amounts, the wire transfer may be requested by discounting the invoice by US$35.00 for international transfers and US$25 for domestic (US) transfers (the charge LCW incurs by initiating the wire transfer).\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\nNicole Barile\n\u00a0\n(She/Her)\nChief Operating Officer\nLCW\n\u00a0\nWebsite\n\u00a0\n|\n\u00a0\nTwitter\n\u00a0\n|\n\u00a0\nFacebook\n\u00a0\n|\n\u00a0\nLinkedIn\nView our upcoming events\n\u00a0| \nSign-up for our newsletter",

We can adjust the\u00a0package to give them scores or try to adapt to their system of distinguishing learners with such limited LMS reporting features. But as shown with our testing, the packages have worked and we'll need their LMS to send us the exact settings that will be needed to accompany Del Monte's method of how they plan to distinguish learners who said Yes or No on the questionnaire.\u00a0\n\u00a0\nPerhaps their system only shows a complete pass/fail scenario? We'd need guidance from their LMS on how scores are captured and if it can distinguish a 50% score that \"fails\" but still passes the course.\u00a0\n\u00a0\nPlease note our so long back and forth comes from their limiting system and as you can notice we are flexible and doing our best to help them get what they need.\nPlease let us know.\nWe are happy to help.\nBest,\nCDS\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\nCatalina De Sanctis\nTranslation Specialist\nLCW\n<image003.png>\n\u00a0\nWebsite\n\u00a0| \nTwitter\n\u00a0| \nFacebook\n\u00a0| \nLinkedIn\nView our upcoming events\n\u00a0| \nSign-up for our newsletter\n\u00a0\nFrom:\n\u00a0Randi Mooney <\nrmooney@diligent.com\n>\nSent:\n\u00a0Thursday, February 20, 2025 1:49 PM\nTo:\n\u00a0Catalina De Sanctis <\nc.desanctis@lcwmail.com\n>\nCc:\n\u00a0Brian Luong <\nbluong@diligent.com\n>; Don Reyes <\ndreyes@diligent.com\n>; Karen Lai <\nklai@diligent.com\n>; Kumud Mishra <\nkmishra@diligent.com\n>; Jorgelina Venturi <\nj.venturi@lcwmail.com\n>\nSubject:\n\u00a0Re: Diligent - WO_DELMONTE_COC_080624 - Del Monte CoC\n\u00a0\nHello,\n\u00a0\nDel Monte will be following up with their LMS on this matter.

This method involves the least amount of scope increase since we're at the translation phase. See below for what I did to the package to relay to them. Then can use the Menu to skip to the Certification slide to test both clickable decisions.\n\u00a0\n<image019.png>\n\u00a0\nOn the screen below, when the learner selects the No, the course will complete when the final slide loads. If the learner selects Yes, then the course will register as incomplete when reaching the final slide. \nIf this is not enough for them, please have Del Monte describe how they are going to mitigate this issue for themselves internally with the limitations of their LMS, and we can adjust the package accordingly. \nSince their LMS doesn't allow the reportage they want, they need to decide how they are going to reach out to people who appear incomplete if this isn't good enough. That may even need to include adding language to the course that would then need translation. Reconfiguration/Testing of the course for numerical scores to be sent to signal the selected response in question, would take 1hr per language to adjust totaling $1400 ($140*10lg) additional to the scope on my end. The adjustment I did here would only increase the scope between $140-$280 overall to apply the fix.\n<image020.png>\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\nPlease let us know your comments.\nThanks!\nCDS\n\u00a0\nCatalina De Sanctis\nTranslation Specialist\nLCW\n<image021.png>\n\u00a0\nWebsite\n\u00a0| \nTwitter\n\u00a0| \nFacebook\n\u00a0| \nLinkedIn\nView our upcoming events\n\u00a0| \nSign-up for our newsletter\n\u00a0\nFrom:\n\u00a0Randi Mooney <\nrmooney@diligent.com\n>\nSent:\n\u00a0Tuesday, February 11, 2025 2:31 PM\nTo:\n\u00a0Catalina De Sanctis <\nc.desanctis@lcwmail.com\n>\nCc:\n\u00a0Brian Luong <\nbluong@diligent.com\n>; Don Reyes <\ndreyes@diligent.com\n>; Karen Lai <\nklai@diligent.com\n>; Kumud Mishra <\nkmishra@diligent.com\n>\nSubject:\n\u00a0Re: Diligent - WO_DELMONTE_COC_080624 - Del Monte CoC\n\u00a0\nHi Catalina,\n\u00a0\nI wanted to follow up to see if Dustin's new test file for Del Monte is ready?

But in the meantime, sent over an invite for Friday.\n\u00a0\nHere is a summary of the situation:\nDel Monte noted earlier this week that the SCORM 2004 test file worked well in their LMS but followed up asking if we could send them their test report.\nWe informed them that without explicit access to their LMS and metadata, it would not be possible to generate a report on their behalf.\nThey replied that their LMS does not allow for any reports to be exported. This is where the misunderstanding occurred.\nEarlier in the project, it was interpreted that they were not getting the desired information from SCORM 1.2 completion reports. That is why we decided to proceed with SCORM 2004 as it allows for customized reportage.\nWe have asked Del Monte to confirm with their LMS, Convercent, what type of reports or metadata can be generated or exported. Awaiting a response here.\nQuestions to discuss:\nIs there any way to run a report on behalf\u00a0of Del Monte?\nHave reporting capabilities been brought up in the prior year updates for Del Monte? If so, what was the recommendation?\nThanks!\n_________________________\nDiligent\nRandi Mooney (Doran),\n\u00a0she/her\nAdvisory Specialist II, Advisory & Consulting Services\nrmooney@diligent.com\n\u00a0| \ndiligent.com\n\u00a0\nFrom:\n\u00a0Catalina De Sanctis <\nc.desanctis@lcwmail.com\n>\nSent:\n\u00a0Wednesday, January 29, 2025 7:23 PM\nTo:\n\u00a0Randi Mooney <\nrmooney@diligent.com\n>; Brian Luong <\nbluong@diligent.com\n>\nCc:\n\u00a0Don Reyes <\ndreyes@diligent.com\n>; Karen Lai <\nklai@diligent.com\n>; Kumud Mishra <\nkmishra@diligent.com\n>\nSubject:\n\u00a0RE: Diligent - WO_DELMONTE_COC_080624 - Del Monte CoC\n\u00a0\nHello Randi,\nIm sorry, tomorrow is complicated.
