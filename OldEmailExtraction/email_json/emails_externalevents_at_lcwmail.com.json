With Disability Lead\u2019s support and active identification, its members strengthen disability representation in positions of power and influence, increasing equity, inclusion, and economic opportunity for all. Disability Lead\u2019s proven track record of shifting power to individuals who live at the intersection of marginalized identities demonstrates that people with disabilities are well-suited to tackle systemic problems that have the largest impacts on the most vulnerable. Founded in Chicago, other regions across the nation are attracted to its approach, and Disability Lead is now embarking on a new journey to replicate and expand the model.\n\u200a\n \nChicago Chefs Cook is a non-profit humanitarian organization serving as an unprecedented platform for chefs and restaurateurs to fundraise for humanitarian causes important to culinarians and their diners. The efforts of Chicago Chefs Cook extend the role of chefs in the Chicagoland area from purveyors of culture-rich culinary experiences to multi-dimensional civic leaders. In this way, the organization amplifies the sphere of impact that chefs uniquely create and unlocks deeper points of connectivity between chefs, diners, and community members. The result is a more invested city that shows up for each other, with chefs, and food, serving as the vital connective tissue that binds us all.\n\u200a\n \nWith the onset of COVID-19, Cook County partnered with the Illinois Manufacturing Excellence Center (IMEC) to conduct a historic outreach and census of suburban Cook County manufacturers to assess the pandemic\u2019s impact on their businesses. Manufacturing Reinvented utilizes technical assistance from IMEC to help manufacturers address these identified priorities. Eligible projects cover themes such as market growth, workforce training, operational improvements, and leadership, all aligned with survey results.\n\u200a\n \nCareers in technology have long been dominated by men: despite making up approximately half of the U.S. workforce, only around 29% of technology sector workers identify as female. With more than 4,000 students enrolled to date, the Women+Tech Scholars Program is designed to empower women pursuing careers in technology to reach their breakthrough moments. The program\u2019s educational offerings, resources, and professional networks help narrow employment and advancement gaps for women in tech-related roles. In addition to learning opportunities, scholars receive career guidance, financial support, and real-world work experience through a community of passionate advocates\u2014many of whom started in the same place as the learners today.\n\u200a\n \nHyperelastic Bone\u00ae represents a new generation of regenerative biomaterials that leverages a unique approach to restoring functionality in the body through a dynamic collaboration between biology and 3D-printed biomaterials. The first product made from this novel technology is CMFlex\u2122, a ready-to-use bone graft substitute and the first 3D-printed regenerative bone product cleared by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) for facial reconstruction applications. CMFlex offers a safe and effective alternative to traditional bone grafts\u2014one that can save valuable time during surgical procedures and transform the current standard of care.\n\u200a\n \nThe Springrose Mobility Bra\u2122 is the world\u2019s most versatile bra, thoughtfully designed for women who have limited mobility due to injury, illness, disability, or aging. For those who struggle with traditional bras, its innovative modular design offers over eight different ways to put it on \u2014 including one-handed, stepping in, or overhead \u2014 allowing women to dress painlessly, independently, and with dignity. Despite its innovative functionality, the Mobility Bra\u2122 remains stylish, comfortable, and pacemaker-safe, and is available in the most inclusive size range in the adaptive intimates category. With a granted utility and design patent from the USPTO and patents pending internationally, it redefines what\u2019s possible for apparel.\n\u200a\n \nTrue Star\u2019s innovative social enterprise tackles critical challenges by offering transformative education and hands-on training in media arts and digital marketing to local youth. Their comprehensive curriculum spans journalism, video production, digital marketing, and more, equipping local youth with the essential skills to thrive in the digital age. \n\u200a\n \nREACH Pathways bridges the opportunity gap for under-resourced learners by combining game-based learning with AI-powered tools to build leadership and career skills. REACH provides learners with personalized support, financial resources, and a community that drives success in education and careers. \n\u200a\n \nFounded in 2021, First Women\u2019s Bank is the only commercial bank in the country with a strategic focus on supporting the women\u2019s economy and closing the gender lending gap. To execute this mission, we recruit deposits from individuals, organizations, and corporations that share our vision. These funds are then strategically deployed to \ufb01nance small businesses, with a focus on supporting the women\u2019s economy. We recognize that small businesses are the backbone of our economy, and we are committed to providing the capital they need to succeed. Banking with FWB means becoming part of a community that deeply understands and is committed to growing the economy and the role of women within it.\nView all 2024 Chicago Innovation Award Winners\u00a0\n \n\u200a\n \nCelebrating the women of the Chicago Innovation team and \n\ufeff\nall the work they do for the innovation community\n \n \n \nRosalyn King \nVice President \u2014 Finance & Operations\nLaura Jordan LeClair\nDirector \u2014 Mentoring and Inclusion Programs\nAnna Aguiar Kosicki\nSenior Coordinator of Events and Programs\n \n \n \nMalak Mekha \nSocial Media Coordinator \nMolly Seedhouse\nDirector \u2014 Illinois Student Invention Convention \nGalyna Kravets\nGraphic Designer\n\u200a\n \n\u200a\n \nChicago Innovation Fellows Second Session\nOn February 25th, \nChicago Innovation Fellows gathered for an impactful second session.

    "subject": "Today's Leadership: What's Required?",
    "body": "Out & Equal\u2019s March 2025 Newsletter\n \n\u200a\n\u200a\nToday's Leadership: What's Required?\n\u00a0\nOut & Equal is less than two weeks away from hosting the \n2025 Leadership Forum\n. As we finalize our programming for Partners, our north star is: \nwhat will it take to lead in these unprecedented times?\n\u00a0\nFrom work teams and Employee Resource Groups (ERGs) or Business Resource Groups (BRGs), to an entire organization or community, leadership plays an integral role in:\u00a0\nsetting a vision and defining a compelling and community-centered path forward where no one is left behind;\u00a0\nlistening, validating, and meeting people where they are to hear and acknowledge concerns\u2013even when you might not have clear answers; and\u00a0\nbuilding cultures of trust and support where mistakes are acknowledged, learned from, and tackled together.\u00a0\nWhen any of these areas begin to lag, especially in times when there are other stressors or confusion, that is when challenges and gaps develop, and profound fear can exacerbate.\u00a0\nSo, in this age when there is so much turmoil and so much at stake, where do we go from here? How can leaders instill confidence, trust, and support? What does leadership need to look like today?\u00a0\nAuthenticity, transparency, and inclusion are key. \nPeople are looking for leaders who speak truth and admit mistakes or knowledge gaps, level set and take a commonsense approach to issues, and build cultures that foster inclusion, which tap into the potential of us all.\u00a0\n \nBe bold and empathetic. \nBeing an effective leader means having the support to realize your vision. Meeting people where they are, acknowledging their experiences, and bringing them on a journey\u2014as opposed to pushing them down a path\u2014builds trust and respect all while yielding better business results.\u00a0\u00a0\n \nRemain mission-focused. \nBe disciplined in remaining focused on your highest goals and opportunities ahead. Do not let the immediacy of the current storm cloud your judgement and decision-making. Stay focused, remain committed to your values, support your teams, and keep pushing forward.\u00a0\n \nIn these times of upheaval, effective, strong, and inclusive leadership is the most strategic formula to uplift individuals, teams, and entire organizations. It instills confidence, hope, and trust. It reminds people that they matter and someone, through the hardships and victories, has their back.\u00a0\nAt Out & Equal, that is the type of leadership we bring to the table to our more than 330 Partner organizations. We serve as confidantes, thought partners, and strategic advisors. We\u2019re there to work in true partnership to improve workplaces, optimize culture, and advance their business, talent and culture objectives.\u00a0\nTo all the leaders out there, emerging and seasoned, here is my closing message to you all: keep listening, keep learning, and keep growing. Remember your north star. And remember the power of community. As a CEO, I am inspired by all of you building, in partnership with us, towards the Business of Belonging. \u00a0\n\u00a0\n \n \n \n \nCelebrating Women\u2019s History Month: Firsts Are Essential. Seconds Are Critical. Movements Must Be Intentional.\n\u00a0\nAs we kick off Women\u2019s History Month, it\u2019s key we acknowledge the challenges all\u00a0\nwomen\u2014particularly Queer women, transgender women, and women of color\u2014have and continue to face in the workplace and beyond.\u00a0\nTo ensure the growth and success of our teams, organizations, and communities, we must invest in all women. We must create inclusive spaces where their voices are heard and amplified. We must acknowledge, recognize, and respect their unique experiences and identities. And we must address our own biases and show up as authentic allies. \nNow more than ever, allies\u2013especially if you are a \u201cfirst\u201d to anyone around you or looking up to you\n\u2013\nmust pull people in and up, so that we can keep walking forward together as a community and build firsts and seconds into a movement.\nRead More\n \n\u200a\n\u200a\nRecognizing, Honoring, and Celebrating Transgender Day of Visibility (March 31)\nTransgender and nonbinary people have made our communities and society stronger with contributions that have shaped business, technology, and culture. Across movements and moments, the community has pushed the cause of equality forward for all people.\u00a0\n\u00a0\nAs transgender and nonbinary people face systemic attacks, discrimination, and erasure, allies and the broader LGBTQ+ community have common ground to stand up for and alongside our transgender and nonbinary community authentically and intentionally.\u00a0\n\u00a0\nOn Transgender Day of Visibility and beyond, what can you do to support the community and elevate the conversation?\nFamiliarize yourself with transgender history and transgender heroes in our movement. \nLearn about who they are and \nhow they have made our\u00a0world a better, stronger place\n.\n\u00a0\n \nBe an authentic ally.

    "body": "The New Executive Playbook\nView in browser\nDear Ashton,\n\u00a0\nAs organizations face economic uncertainty, AI-driven transformation, and shifting workforce expectations, one challenge remains constant: how to develop leaders who can navigate complexity and drive business success.\nFor senior learning and talent leaders, ensuring executives have the right mix of financial acumen, strategic agility, and AI fluency is critical. The latest research highlights three key leadership shifts that learning and development (L&D) leaders should prioritize in their executive education strategies.\n\u00a0\nThree Critical Shifts Defining Leadership in 2025\n\ud83d\udccc \nPricing Strategy as a Leadership Competency\nAccording to Forbes, companies that leverage data-driven pricing strategies achieve higher profitability and customer loyalty. As organizations invest in leadership development, training executives in behavioral economics, AI-driven pricing models, and value-based decision-making will be a competitive advantage.\nRead More:\n \nForbes \u2013 The CEO\u2019s Guide to Pricing\n\u00a0\n\ud83d\udccc \nReimagining Finance Strategy for Business Agility\nThe ability to think strategically about financial decisions is no longer limited to CFOs. HR, L&D, and business leaders need to understand finance at a high level to support growth, workforce investments, and long-term planning. For L&D leaders, this means ensuring executives and high-potential talent are equipped with the financial literacy to connect business strategy with financial decision-making.\nRead More:\n \nGartner \u2013 How to Create a Better Finance Strategy\n\u00a0\n\ud83d\udccc \nAI is Reshaping Leadership\u2014Are Executives Prepared?\nAI adoption is accelerating, but most organizations lack leaders who understand how to integrate AI into workforce strategies. McKinsey research shows that while 70% of companies are increasing AI investments, only a fraction are developing leaders who can harness AI to drive productivity and innovation. Talent leaders must prioritize executive education that develops AI literacy, human-AI collaboration skills, and digital transformation strategies to future-proof their workforce.\nRead More:\n \nMcKinsey \u2013 Empowering People to Unlock AI\u2019s Full Potential\n\u00a0\nHow Learning & Talent Leaders Are Preparing Their Workforces\nTo navigate these challenges, leading organizations are rethinking their leadership development strategies and investing in executive education programs that equip leaders with financial, strategic, and AI-driven decision-making skills.\n\u00a0\nFrom Our Sponsor:\n\u00a0\nChicago Booth Executive Education\n is at the forefront of \nhelping organizations build resilient, forward-thinking leadership pipelines.\n Programs focused on \npricing strategy, financial decision-making, and digital innovation\n empower executives with the tools needed to lead effectively in today\u2019s complex business landscape.\n\u00a0\n\ud83d\udce5 \nDownload the 2025 Executive Education Catalog\n to explore how organizations are developing leaders for the future. \nAccess the Catalog\n\u00a0\nBest,\n \nAshley St. John\nEditor in Chief\nChief Learning Officer\nCopyright \u00a9 2025 BetterWork Media Group | All rights reserved.\n\u00a0\nReproduction in whole or in part in any form or medium without written permission of BetterWork Media Group is prohibited.\n\u00a0\nBetterWork Media Group, Publisher of Chief Learning Officer & Chief Talent Officer\n\u00a0\n\u00a01 E.

    "subject": "Fair360: Where We're Going",
    "body": "Dear Ashton,\n\u00a0\nI changed the name of my company from DiversityInc to Fair360 two years ago. I saw the anti-DEI movement coming. It's OK, progress requires adaptation and innovation. Change is necessary when, as one example, you have a system where women have earned more than half of bachelor's and master's degree since the 1980s (and earned more than half of PhDs since the 1990s). Despite this, women are only 10% of Fortune 500 CEOs.\n\u00a0\nFocusing on Outcomes\nWe have moved away from representation to outcomes. Outcomes are expressed for every demographic. This year, we provided every company with a monetary value of their inclusive human resources initiatives - expressed as existing (dollar value) benefit and opportunity (if management of initiatives was improved to that of top-performing companies).\n\u00a0\nFairness Report Insights\nWe also provided a fairness report, which conclusively showed that white people are not systematically discriminated against even in companies that had the most robust inclusion initiatives. This is critical. The progress of some cannot come at the penalty of others. The perception that it does is at the root of much anti-DEI sentiment. That said, individual cases of discrimination against white people (and every other group) cannot be denied. No company can absolutely guard itself against the intentional misbehavior of individuals.\n\u00a0\nOptimized Survey\nOur survey has been optimized to be more efficient, now containing fewer than 100 questions. We have removed compensation-related inquiries and made supplier outreach and philanthropy optional, ensuring a more focused and relevant experience for participants.\n\u00a0\nData-Driven Analysis\nAt the core of our work is data-driven analysis that helps companies quantify the impact of their inclusion efforts. Voluntary turnover, a key indicator of workplace equity, varies significantly across industries\u2014sometimes by a factor of four. This presents an astonishing competitive advantage\u2014or disadvantage. Our data demonstrates that higher turnover is linked to increased bias, making it a critical metric for organizations to monitor given the increasing diversity of workforce demographics.\n\u00a0\nRefined Benchmarking Approach\nTo help organizations drive measurable progress, we are refining our benchmarking approach, focusing on five key inclusion initiatives: mentorship, sponsorship, high potentials, employee resource groups (ERGs) and executive HR councils. These areas have been identified in our data as essential for improving the quality of recruitment, retention and development.\u00a0\n\u00a0\nCommitment to Verified Meritocracy\nAs workplace dynamics continue to evolve, we are adopting the language of \u201cmeritocracy\u201d to reinforce our commitment to fairness and equity across all employee groups. This holistic approach ensures that inclusion efforts are assessed comprehensively. In alignment with this direction, we have secured the domains meritocracy360.com and verifiedmeritocracy.com and are restructuring our online presence accordingly.\n\u00a0\nFlagship Event in NYC\nOur flagship event at Cipriani\u2019s Wall Street in New York City on May 6 will reflect this refined strategy. Moving away from rankings and company callouts, the event will focus on mentorship, talent development and real-world learning opportunities. With a special emphasis on first-generation college students, the event will provide mentorship, interviews and discussions on essential topics such as financial literacy, equipping the next generation with the skills they need for long-term success.\n\u00a0\nThrough these strategic refinements, we remain committed to delivering data-driven insights, promoting inclusive business practices and fostering a representative pipeline of future leaders.\n\u00a0\nTake the Survey\nI encourage you to \nfill out our survey\n. There is no deadline. It will be open all year. You will receive a \nfree report card\n that will give you a monetary value of your current efforts, and opportunity value of improving your efforts. This is an editorial process, thus protected by New Jersey's shield law. We have not been compelled to comply with a single subpoena since we started to collect data in 2003. There will be no public rankings, but you will receive a private ranking, if interested.\n\u00a0\nFinal Thoughts\nIn closing, my advice to everyone is to ground your work in monetary value, described in absolute terms. You cannot lose a shareholder agreement that way. A boss once told me that \"beliefs\" have no place in business because a \"belief\" is an acceptance of an intangible. Business is tangible. If you want to be relevant, be tangible.\n\u00a0\nThank you,\n\u00a0\nLuke Visconti, \nFounder and Chairman, \nFair360\nFair360, is a VA-certified and veteran-owned business., It is certified by Disability:IN as a company owned by a person with a disability., \nhttps://www.fair360.com/\n, \u00a9 Copyright 2024 Fair360 \nUnsubscribe\n \nManage preferences",
