That\u2019s why the dots are still gray in Compass, the money is just waiting to be applied.\n\u00a0\nBSC does not owe us any more money on this SOW, we have it in hand.

I\u2019m sure I\u2019m missing some process though, and I appreciate if that was explained to me. \n\u00a0\n\u00a0\nGap $5,005\n\u00a0\nColgate $25,000\nColgate was reassigned to me recently. I assume this $25k is associated with SOW 2024-175?\nI see that $110,500 of this SOW has been invoiced and collected, and it would be super helpful if you indicated which line items in the SOW require invoicing?\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\nI also see in Scoro that perhaps we should also be billing for Debevoise & Lendlease....?\n\u00a0\nIf something has changed, please notify her. If not, please make sure the invoice is created in Scoro & marked as \"Ready to Invoice\" asap.\nThank you!\n\u00a0\nNicole Barile\n\u00a0\n(She/Her)\nChief Operating Officer\nLCW\n\u00a0\nWebsite\n\u00a0\n|\n\u00a0\nTwitter\n\u00a0\n|\n\u00a0\nFacebook\n\u00a0\n|\n\u00a0\nLinkedIn\nView our upcoming events\n\u00a0| \nSign-up for our newsletter",
