As I mentioned, it\u2019s difficult to align our value without the knowledge of what you are trying to solve for in your evaluation process. \n\u00a0\nMy recommendation to Daniel was that we set aside some time for a demo. From there, we can go through what a day-in-the-life in Outreach would look like for your teams, get clarity on your internal set-up of Salesforce/HubSpot, and better determine our fit. You can find my calendar link below to get that call scheduled. \n\u00a0\nSee available times\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\nRegarding the security and compliance documentation - we have plenty of resources for this, but it\u2019d be best to see that we are aligned on our solution offering prior to kicking off this paper process. \n\u00a0\nLet me know if you have any questions or concerns.
