    "body": "Celebrating 10 Years With Us!\nHaitian Creole In Digital Age: From Spoken Word \nTo Global Platforms.\n\u00a0\nBonjou Maria!\n\u00a0\nWhat is possible?\n When it comes to Haitian Creole in the digital age, the answer is more exciting than ever.\n\u00a0\nFor generations, Creole thrived in conversations, music, and storytelling. But now, it\u2019s making waves in spaces once thought unreachable\u2014on social media, in digital platforms, and across global networks. The demand for Creole is growing and\u00a0 transforming the way people connect, communicate, and claim their linguistic identity.\n\u00a0\nIn 2022, Creole Solutions played a pivotal role in this movement, helping one of the world\u2019s biggest tech companies localize their platform entirely in Creole. The result? A moment of pure joy and validation for countless Creole speakers who finally saw their language fully represented in the digital world.\n \nWhat is possible?\n \nHaitian Creole In The Digital Age!\nThe rapid rise in demand for\n Haitian Creole\n was an indication of major shifts in language use. Soon after their arrival, Haitian immigrants in the U.S. no longer relied on the stilted French they had learned in school and instead turned to Creole as their main language of communication.\u00a0\n\u00a0\nWith Creole already spoken and used in print, for example for tax forms, it was hardly a surprise that\n social media came next.\n\u00a0\nThousands of people began to exchange messages in Creole on social platforms. In 2022, \nCreole Solutions\n was selected by one of the giants in the social media business to help translate the entire user interface of their platform.\n\u00a0\nCreole was entering the digital age, and \nMarleen and her team\n were right in the middle of the effort. Many people had the same response when they first saw the fully localized interface in their own language: Tears of joy.\n\u00a0\n \nLocWorld\n is the leading conference for global business, translation, and localization\u2014bringing together experts shaping the future of language access. At LocWorld, Marleen Julien shared how\n Haitian Creole\n is making its mark in the digital world, including the launch of a social media platform fully accessible in Creole.\nCelebrate with Us!\n\u00a0\nWhat\u2019s Next?\nHaitian Creole is making strides in digital spaces. From social media platforms to online learning and business tools, the language is reaching more people than ever before. Creole is no longer just spoken\u2014it\u2019s written, shared, and embedded in the digital world.\n\u00a0\nEach month, we will highlight a new way Haitian Creole is expanding.\u00a0Let\u2019s continue the conversation. Share your thoughts and experiences\u2014because every step forward for Creole is a step toward greater access and visibility.\nLearn more about us\n \nStay in the loop!\nFor more updates and exciting news, make sure to follow our page and stay connected with us on social media.\u00a0\n \n \n \n \nCreole Solutions, 4957 Oakton Street, Suite 203, Skokie, IL 60076, United States \nManage preferences",

Experts from architectural and engineering firms, along with construction managers, evaluated District 214\u2019s buildings and identified key infrastructure needs, including HVAC systems, roofing, plumbing, classroom modernization and athletic facility updates. The assessment outlined more than $850 million in potential improvements, underscoring the need for strategic prioritization and funding solutions. The District\u2019s facilities were built decades ago, and while ongoing maintenance has kept them functional, larger-scale improvements are needed to ensure they continue meeting students\u2019 educational needs. \nExploring funding strategies\n \nElk Grove High School's student services area was renovated over the summer.\nWith major improvements necessary, the Board explored various funding options, including potential bond measures, grants and other financial strategies. The discussion focused on balancing the urgency of repairs with fiscal responsibility, ensuring that any funding approach is sustainable and minimizes impact on taxpayers. The Board is committed to maintaining financial stability while addressing the infrastructure needs of the district.\nLong-term planning for schools of the future\n \nThe new state-of-the-art culinary lab at Elk Grove High School was unveiled in the fall.\nIn addition to addressing immediate facility needs, the board discussed long-term strategic planning to modernize school buildings and create learning environments that align with evolving educational needs. Plans include reviewing spaces to support innovative teaching methods, integrating new technology, and improving energy efficiency across all facilities. Future projects may focus on upgrading science labs, expanding career and technical education facilities, and enhancing common areas to foster collaboration and student engagement.\nCommitment to safe and effective learning environments\n \nStudents can gather, meet college representatives and attend events at Elk Grove High School's new multi-purpose postsecondary center.\nThe Board reaffirmed its dedication to providing students with safe, well-maintained and innovative learning spaces. Investments in facilities are directly tied to student success, as modern, well-equipped classrooms contribute to engagement and achievement. The Board will continue evaluating priorities to ensure all schools remain state-of-the-art for current and future students.\nNext steps and community engagement\n \nBuffalo Grove High School's athletic fields are being upgraded and improved.\nThe Board will continue reviewing infrastructure needs and potential funding strategies in upcoming meetings. Community engagement will play a key role in determining the path forward, with opportunities for stakeholders to provide input on priorities. The District has issued a Request for Proposals (RFP) to identify a consultant to assist with the community engagement process. Stay tuned for further updates on how District 214 is planning for the future.\nRoll Call Action Items\nClick \nHERE\n to see documents related to the following Roll Call Action and Discussion items from the February 28 meeting:\n6.1.

This new technology is set to transform machine translation, translation evaluation methods and metrics, as well as ethical standards. Whether you\u2019re eager to embrace LLMs or still unsure, this session will bring you up to speed on the latest developments that every localization professional should know. By the end of this session, you\u2019ll be ready to navigate the rapidly evolving LLM landscape, whether you\u2019re ready to implement these tools or just want to better understand their potential impact.\nHere\u2019s what we\u2019ll cover:\nMetrics evolution\n: Learn which traditional metrics are becoming outdated with the rise of LLMs. We\u2019ll dive into new evaluation methods that focus on context and nuanced language, offering a more comprehensive view of translation quality.\nMitigating hallucinations\n: LLMs are powerful, but they come with challenges. We\u2019ll explore how to detect and minimize \u201challucinations\u201d\u2014instances where models generate incorrect or misleading information\u2014and examine ways LLMs are improving at self-correcting errors. This helps ensure more reliable and trustworthy translations.\nEmbracing opportunities\n: With diversity, equity, and inclusion (DEI) at the forefront of conversations today, we\u2019ll discuss how LLMs handle things like gender biases and their strengths and weaknesses in promoting inclusive translations.\nS\ufeffpeakers\nAlex Yanishevsky\n:\u00a0Senior Director of AI and Machine Translation,\u00a0Smartling\nAlex is the senior director of AI and machine translation at Smartling and has been in the localization industry for over 20 years.
