See \nTerms of Service\n for more details. \n2 5 Days Early to Your Bank Account: Personal taxes only. Your federal tax refund will be deposited to your selected bank account 5 days before the refund settlement date provided by the IRS (the date your refund would have arrived if sent from the IRS directly). The receipt of your refund 5 Days Early is subject to IRS submitting refund information to us at least 5 days before the refund settlement date. IRS does not always provide refund settlement information 5 days early. You will not be eligible to receive your refund 5 Days Early if (1) you take a Refund Advance loan, (2) IRS delays payment of your refund, or (3) your bank\u2019s policies do not allow for same-day payment processing. 5 Days Early fee will be deducted directly from your refund prior to being deposited to your bank account. If your refund cannot be delivered 5 Days Early, you will not be charged the 5 Days Early fee. 5 Days Early program may change or be discontinued at any time. \nClick here\n to see TurboTax product guarantees, disclaimers and other important information. \nThis email \nwas \nsent to: \nd.trincado@lcwmail.com\n \nDid you receive this email in error? \nFind out why\n. \nUpdate your email preferences or unsubscribe \nhere\n. \n\u00a92025 Intuit Inc.

The good news? Workers want help quitting. In fact, 66% of them would be very interested in using a tobacco cessation program through their dental insurance plan if it came at no additional cost. This is especially true for workers whose children may also use tobacco products, especially e-cigarettes. Organizations would benefit, too, by retaining a healthier, more productive workforce and lower medical claims costs.\n\u00a0\nA few of the findings:\u00a0\n60% of smokeless tobacco users say that if they knew the products harmed their oral health, they would consider quitting.\n\u00a0\n82% of workers with a child who uses tobacco would be interested in a tobacco cessation program if the program were available to dependents.\n\u00a0\nCigarette smokers take an average of over 7 more days of sick leave per year compared to non-smokers.\nExpanding benefits programs to include support for tobacco cessation can be important for oral, physical, and mental health. \nDownload the report\n \nto discover how to find the right solutions.\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\nExplore Guardian Edge\n\u00a0\nGet the latest workplace benefits insights with a variety of content \u2014 including articles, checklists, reports, and more \u2014 to help support all stages of your employees' journeys.\u202f\nVisit Guardian Edge\n.\n\u200a\nUnless otherwise noted, all data is sourced from Guardian\u2019s 13th Annual Workplace Benefits Study, 2024.\n\u00a0\nFor broker/agent use only.\n\u00a0\nMaterial discussed is meant for general informational purposes only and is not to be construed as tax, legal, medical or financial advice.

But many employees may not make this connection, and fail to protect their income the way they protect other things that are innately important to them \u2014 health, home, and family.\nBy shedding light on some of the misconceptions around disability insurance, workers are able to help better protect themselves and employers are able to help better protect their workforces.

In fact, \n25% of today\u2019s 20-year-olds\n will take a disability-related leave before reaching retirement age.\n2\n And 30% of US households have had a main wage earner experience at least one injury, illness, or condition that resulted in either a short-term disability (STD) or long-term disability (LTD) leave sometime in the past 10 years.\n3\nLeading causes of disability claims:\nDisability insurance covers a lot more than your employees might realize.

On average, 38% of employers pay the full cost of their disability benefit plans, 47% share the cost with workers, and 17% offer employee-pay-all or voluntary disability coverage.\n5\nOther support for employees facing a possible disability leave\nTaking a disability leave may be stressful for employees.
