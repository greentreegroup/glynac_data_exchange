Trados Enterprise, Accelerate, Team & cloud capabilities in Studio\nIN Trados Team (university use) my student's project language pair is English -> Chinese (Traditional) and this was used for the TM. However the TB language pair is English - Chinese, as this seemed to be the only selection. She can't see (lookup) the TB when editing in Online Editor. Does the language pair of the TB have to match exactly the project/TM pair? The same would apply to varieties of Spanish and Arabic for example.\nThank you\nRWS Community AI\u00a0on\u00a027 Mar 2025 12:19 PM\n\"Probability score\": 0.9\n\"Question improvement suggestion\": The question is quite clear, but it would be helpful to know the version of Trados Team being used.\nIn the meantime, based on the information you have provided, here is a suggested answer to your question:\nHello,\nYes, the language pair of the Termbase (TB) needs to match exactly with the project/Translation Memory (TM) pair in Trados Team. This is because Trados Team uses the language pair to determine which TBs and TMs to use during translation. If the language pair of the TB doesn't match the project/TM pair, the TB won't be visible during translation.\nFor example, if your student's project language pair is English -> Chinese (Traditional), the TB should also be set to English -> Chinese (Traditional). If the TB is set to English -> Chinese, it won't be visible because \"Chinese\" and \"Chinese (Traditional)\" are considered different languages in Trados Team.\nThe same applies to varieties of Spanish and Arabic. Each variety is considered a different language, so the TB and project/TM pairs need to match exactly.\nTo resolve this issue, your student should create a new TB with the exact language pair as the project/TM. Once the new TB is created and populated with terms, it should be visible during translation in the Online Editor.\nI hope this answer addressed your question.

Trados Enterprise, Accelerate, Team & cloud capabilities in Studio\nI am managing an enterprise term base in Trados Terminology. All entries\u00a0have specific attributes to denote domain and class as well as\u00a0standard term metadata such as status, term type, etc. I would like to be able to batch edit, batch delete or merge entries in the term base but I cannot find a way to do this.\nUse cases:\nMerge: I want to merge 2 or more existing duplicate entries, not merge a new entry into an existing entry.\nBatch edit: I want to batch edit to apply a filter and then change an attribute for all entries at the same time\nBatch delete: I want to apply a filter and remove several entries that meet the filter criteria.\nI have checked the technical documentation, knowledge base and community for an existing answer but only found information relating to MultiTerm.\nCan anyone advise if there is a function that I'm missing?\nJo Chapman\u00a0on\u00a027 Mar 2025 8:58 AM\nThanks for the clarification, Daniel. I'll bear the roadmap in mind.\nDaniel Brockmann\u00a0on\u00a027 Mar 2025 7:59 AM\nHi Jo,\nMerging is on the more short-term (CY 2025) while batch-edit and batch-delete on the longer term roadmap. To trigger a kind of 'force merge' in the meantime as a potential workaround, you can start editing the existing\u00a0entry that you want to merge, and\u00a0enter the same source term as a synonym (or edit an existing term to make it the same term as in the entry you want to merge). This will trigger the merge duplicate flow where you can then decide which fields to merge. If multiple duplicates exist, you can decide which one to merge with. We will look at decoupling this 'forced' merge flow into a separate merge flow that would not require this kind of artificial merge. It works quite well though, this helped me merge a few entries in a fairly complex termbase the other day.\nAlso tagging \nAna-Maria Totea\n\u00a0 and \nAdrian Manea\n\u00a0 as an FYI.\nThanks, Daniel\nJo Chapman\u00a0on\u00a026 Mar 2025 1:16 PM\nThe answer relates to a different product.\nRWS Community AI\u00a0on\u00a026 Mar 2025 1:15 PM\n\"Probability score\": 0.7\n\"Question improvement suggestion\": Please provide the exact version of Trados Terminology you are using and any error messages you might have encountered while trying to perform these actions. Also, it would be helpful to know if there have been any recent changes to your system or software.\nIn the meantime, based on the information you have provided, here is a suggested answer to your question:\nHello,\nFrom your description, it seems like you're trying to perform batch operations in Trados Terminology. While Trados Terminology does not directly support batch operations, you can use MultiTerm, which is part of the Trados Studio suite, to perform these tasks.\nHere are the steps you can follow:\nStep 1: Open MultiTerm and select the termbase you want to edit.\nStep 2: For batch editing, you can use the 'Termbase > Edit > Edit Entry' option. You can apply a filter and then change an attribute for all entries at the same time.\nStep 3: For batch deletion, you can use the 'Termbase > Delete Entry' option. Again, you can apply a filter and remove several entries that meet the filter criteria.\nStep 4: For merging entries, you can use the 'Synchronize on Entry Number' option during import to merge terms correctly. \nPlease note that these operations should be performed with caution as they can significantly alter your termbase. Always make sure to back up your termbase before making any changes.\nI hope this answer addressed your question. If not, please reject the answer, add the question improvement suggestion information, and click the RWS Community AI checkbox on the right to try again.\nRWS Community AI\n\u00a0\nNew replies to\nHELP!

Because now, if I type another letter than the one the word autosuggest wants to propose starts with, I won't see the suggestion in the drop-down menu in the segment itself.\nAn example: if I write 'Please give me a p', with the intention of writing 'proposal', Autosuggest won't prompt me with 'suggestion' instead.\nHowever, if Autosuggest were active right after a space, I would see the word 'suggestion' suggested when I type\n\u00a0'Please give me a\u00a0'.\n\u00a0\n\u30d5\u30a1\u30a4\u30eb\u3092\u958b\u3044\u305f\u3068\u304d\u3001\u76f4\u524d\u306b\u9589\u3058\u305f\u30d5\u30a1\u30a4\u30eb\u306e\u30d5\u30a3\u30eb\u30bf\u8a2d\u5b9a\u304c\u6b8b\u3063\u305f\u307e\u307e\u306b\u306a\u3063\u3066\u3044\u308b\u306e\u3067\u56f0\u308b\nby\u00a0\nNoriko Hirose\n\u00a0on\u00a026 Mar 2025 4:19 AM\u00a0in\u00a0\nTrados Studio Ideas\n\u4f7f\u7528\u30d0\u30fc\u30b8\u30e7\u30f3\uff1aTrados Studio 2024 (CU2\uff1a18.0.2.3255)\n\u30a8\u30c7\u30a3\u30bf\u3067\u30d5\u30a1\u30a4\u30eb\u3092\u958b\u3044\u305f\u3068\u304d\u3001\u76f4\u524d\u306b\u9589\u3058\u305f\u30d5\u30a1\u30a4\u30eb\u306e\u30d5\u30a3\u30eb\u30bf\u8a2d\u5b9a\u304c\u6709\u52b9\u306e\u307e\u307e\u306b\u306a\u3063\u3066\u3044\u308b\u3002\n\u5225\u30d7\u30ed\u30b8\u30a7\u30af\u30c8\u306e\u30d5\u30a1\u30a4\u30eb\u3067\u3082\u540c\u3058\u3002\nCU1\u307e\u3067\u306f\u3001\u9589\u3058\u305f\u30d5\u30a1\u30a4\u30eb\u306e\u30d5\u30a3\u30eb\u30bf\u8a2d\u5b9a\u304c\u6b8b\u3089\u306a\u3044\u4ed5\u69d8\u3060\u3063\u305f\u3002\n\u30d5\u30a1\u30a4\u30eb\u3092\u958b\u3044\u305f\u3068\u304d\u3001\u30d5\u30a3\u30eb\u30bf\u304c\u304b\u304b\u3063\u305f\u72b6\u614b\u3067\u8868\u793a\u3055\u308c\u308b\u306e\u3067\u56f0\u308b\u3002\n----------------------\nFilter settings persist between files in Trados Studio 2024 CU2\nIn Trados Studio 2024 (CU2: 18.0.2.3255), when opening a file in the Editor, the filter settings from the previously closed file remain active \u2014 even if the file belongs to a different project.\nThis is a change from previous behaviour (up to CU1), where filter settings were reset upon closing a file.\nThe result is that newly opened files can appear with filters already applied, which is confusing and inconvenient, especially when working across multiple projects.\nSuggestion:\n Please revert to the previous behaviour where filter settings are cleared when a file is closed.\nDaniel Brockmann\u00a0on\u00a026 Mar 2025 8:13 AM\nMachine Translation: Title -\u00a0\nWhen I open a file, the filter settings from the file I just closed remain, which is annoying.

But now, it\u2019s making waves in spaces once thought unreachable\u2014on social media, in digital platforms, and across global networks. The demand for Creole is growing and\u00a0 transforming the way people connect, communicate, and claim their linguistic identity.\n\u00a0\nIn 2022, Creole Solutions played a pivotal role in this movement, helping one of the world\u2019s biggest tech companies localize their platform entirely in Creole. The result? A moment of pure joy and validation for countless Creole speakers who finally saw their language fully represented in the digital world.\n \nWhat is possible?\n \nHaitian Creole In The Digital Age!\nThe rapid rise in demand for\n Haitian Creole\n was an indication of major shifts in language use. Soon after their arrival, Haitian immigrants in the U.S. no longer relied on the stilted French they had learned in school and instead turned to Creole as their main language of communication.\u00a0\n\u00a0\nWith Creole already spoken and used in print, for example for tax forms, it was hardly a surprise that\n social media came next.\n\u00a0\nThousands of people began to exchange messages in Creole on social platforms. In 2022, \nCreole Solutions\n was selected by one of the giants in the social media business to help translate the entire user interface of their platform.\n\u00a0\nCreole was entering the digital age, and \nMarleen and her team\n were right in the middle of the effort. Many people had the same response when they first saw the fully localized interface in their own language: Tears of joy.\n\u00a0\n \nLocWorld\n is the leading conference for global business, translation, and localization\u2014bringing together experts shaping the future of language access. At LocWorld, Marleen Julien shared how\n Haitian Creole\n is making its mark in the digital world, including the launch of a social media platform fully accessible in Creole.\nCelebrate with Us!\n\u00a0\nWhat\u2019s Next?\nHaitian Creole is making strides in digital spaces. From social media platforms to online learning and business tools, the language is reaching more people than ever before. Creole is no longer just spoken\u2014it\u2019s written, shared, and embedded in the digital world.\n\u00a0\nEach month, we will highlight a new way Haitian Creole is expanding.\u00a0Let\u2019s continue the conversation. Share your thoughts and experiences\u2014because every step forward for Creole is a step toward greater access and visibility.\nLearn more about us\n \nStay in the loop!\nFor more updates and exciting news, make sure to follow our page and stay connected with us on social media.\u00a0\n \n \n \n \nCreole Solutions, 4957 Oakton Street, Suite 203, Skokie, IL 60076, United States \nManage preferences",

    "body": "Update from\u00a0RWS Community\nYOUR\u00a0Weekly\u00a0DIGEST FOR\u00a09 Mar 2025\nTrados Enterprise, Accelerate, Team and cloud capabilities in Trados Studio\nProduct Updates\nNew\u00a0Posts\nTrados 25.03.1 Release\n\u00a0\n2. Trados Enterprise, Accelerate, Team & cloud capabilities in Studio\nNew\u00a0Questions\nTermbase on Trados live Team\nHi, We need to know how to activate the leverage analysis of internal fuzzy matches.\nQA checker restrictions visible for customer reviewers\nNew\u00a0Replies\nTranslation Engine Search Logic\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\nTrados 25.03.1 Release\nby\u00a0\nIan Parnell\n\u00a0on\u00a03 Mar 2025 4:36 PM\u00a0in\u00a0\nProduct Updates\nThe latest Trados release is now available and we\u00a0are excited\u00a0to share the new functionality that has been delivered.\n\u00a0\nNew features and updates are automatically added to your account so just log in to Trados and they will be available immediately.\n\u00a0\nWorkflow views\n(Applies to\n\u00a0\nTrados Team, Accelerate and Enterprise)\nPrior to this release, it was possible to view workflows and interact with them in two different ways: either as a vertical list of tasks and phases (the Vertical view) or as a horizontal representation (the Phases view)\u00a0that was introduced in late-2024. We announced at that time the Vertical view will be removed in an upcoming release.\nBased on customer feedback, we are introducing a new List view. The List view works similarly to the Phases view but presents tasks and phases as a vertical list for users that prefer this layout design.\nThe legacy Vertical view will be removed before the end of March 2025. We therefore encourage users to familiarize themselves with the Phases or List views prior to the Vertical view before removed.\nBatch replace files in Inbox\n(Applies to\n\u00a0\nTrados Team, Accelerate and Enterprise)\nWhen uploading files for accepted tasks from the Inbox, we have extended the automated file matching to check the Task ID from previous tasks.\nAs a practical example, a linguist downloads a file at the Translation task prior to completing the task. This linguist is then also assigned to the subsequent Linguistic Review task, and they upload the same file they downloaded at the earlier Translation task, as it may be more efficient to implement changes in the previous file.\nIf the linguist now uploads the previous file, it will now be automatically matched, despite the Task ID in the file coming from the earlier Translation task.\nIn this scenario, users will be presented with a warning message to explain how the match was identified and to only proceed if this is their intended action, to help prevent human error.\nAnalysis statistics in Inbox\n(Applies to\n\u00a0\nTrados Team, Accelerate and Enterprise)\nWe now include a breakdown of the analysis statistics in the Inbox, so users with tasks assigned to them can easily access this information to help manage and prioritize their workload. Each category from the analysis statistics is displayed as a separate column from a user\u2019s Inbox, with the exception of fuzzy matches which are aggregated into a single column. \nNote: the analysis statistics are only displayed for tasks that are based at target file level and for tasks created following this release.\u00a0The columns will\u00a0appear empty for tasks that were created prior to this release.\nAd-hoc cost type for Pricing Models\n(Applies to\n\u00a0\nTrados Accelerate and Enterprise)\nWe have introduced a new Ad-hoc cost type for Pricing Models that can be used when you want to include a flat cost that isn\u2019t dependent on any other variable in a project, such as the word or page count. Where configured, an Ad-hoc cost can be set implicitly in the original Pricing Model or added during the Customer Quote Review or Vendor Quote Review tasks.\nVendor\u00a0Pricing Models\n(Applies to\n\u00a0\nTrados Accelerate and Enterprise)\nWe have introduced greater flexibility in vendor pricing models to support costs based on a service type.\nPrior to this release, it was already possible to create additional language costs in vendor pricing models based on a service type. With the release, you can also now create additional project costs based on a service type.\nIn addition, you can also define service type costs at language level by entering a cost for each of the bands contained in the pricing model.\nQuote templates for Vendors\n(Applies to\n\u00a0\nTrados Accelerate and Enterprise)\nIt is\u00a0now possible to apply quote templates to vendor quotes. \n\u00a0\nQuote templates allow you to adapt the format and layout of a quote, by\u00a0including your own logo and controlling which information and content should be included. For more information on quote templates, please consult the original release \nannouncement\n or product \ndocumentation\n. In addition, sample quote templates can be found under the Files section in the Trados \nCommunity\n.\n\u00a0\nTo apply quote templates for vendors, you should first create the quote template in the usual manner from the Resources section under the Pricing menu. Once available, you can then associate a quote template with a vendor from the \nVendor > Settings\n page, so this is applied to quotes from that vendor.\n\u00a0\nCustom Reporting updates\n(Applies to\n\u00a0\nTrados Accelerate and Enterprise)\nImage component in Custom Reporting\nReport authors can now upload images directly from their local desktop to QuickSight for a variety of use cases, such as adding company logos and branding, including background images with free-form layout, and creating captivating story covers. This feature also supports tooltip and alt text, providing additional context and accessibility for consumers. Furthermore, it offers navigation and URL actions, enabling authors to make their images interactive, such as triggering specific dashboard actions when the image is clicked.\nFont Customization for Visuals\nThe Custom Reporting module in Trados now supports the ability to customize fonts across specific visuals. Authors can completely customize fonts for Table and Pivot table visuals, while for remaining visuals, they can customize fonts for specific properties including the title, subtitle, legends title and legends values. \nAuthors can set the font size (in pixels), font family, color, and styling options like bold, italics, and underline. With this update, you can align the dashboard's fonts with your organization's branding guidelines, creating a cohesive and visually appealing experience. Additionally, the font customization options can help improve the readability and meet accessibility standards, especially when viewing visuals on a large screen.\nCustom Reporting Workshop\nLater this year, we will be hosting a Custom Reporting workshop as part of our ELEVATE conference, the localization industry's largest online event. This will be of particular interest to report authors working in Trados and help customers unlock the full potential of our custom reporting module. ELEVATE is taking place between the 6-8th May 2025, and you can secure your place at the event by registering \nhere\n.\nAPI\u00a0updates\nAlthough there are no \nchanges to the \nAPI this time, we would like to \ninform \nusers that \nthe \nAPI Keys\n mechanism is being deprecated\n. It will no longer be possible to create new \nAPI Keys\n and users should employ the \nApplication\n \nmethodology\n going forward.\n To keep \nup to date\n with \nAPI changes, \nwe recommend checking with the \nWhat\u2019s New\n page \nregularly to get \nmore details.\nPublic API: UI Extensibility beta\nAs announced previously, we have introduced support for User Interface (UI) Extensions which offer the possibility to add custom user interface elements and functionality. Custom buttons and panels can be added to specific places within the user interface.\n \nUI Extensibility is initially being offered in BETA. Customers interested in evaluating this functionality should keep in mind that significant changes are planned prior to the full release.

It would be really great it priority could be given to the TMs order.\u00a0\nNeeltje Stuurman\u00a0on\u00a03 Mar 2025 10:57 AM\nOK< thanks for confirming.\u00a0\nIt's bad news but still good to know\nPatrik Mazanek\u00a0on\u00a03 Mar 2025 10:51 AM\nI reviewed this once more and I was not correct, currently for matches with the same match value ordering is as follow:\n- change date\n- use count\n- TM order\nThis should be consistent behavior between Studio and Trados Cloud.\nNeeltje Stuurman\u00a0on\u00a03 Mar 2025 9:45 AM\nPatrik Mazanek\n\u00a0\nAh, so that would mean that in the example above the \"Grondstoffen\" translation would be returned, even thoigh it is 'older', as the TM is higher up in the order?\nThat would be a massive relief!\nPatrik Mazanek\u00a0on\u00a03 Mar 2025 9:40 AM\nFirst we look across all TMs, on all hits, a TM specific penalty is applied. Then the results are returned based on the match value. For results with the same\u00a0value, we sort them by the TM order, then by the dates.\nNeeltje Stuurman\u00a0on\u00a03 Mar 2025 9:26 AM\nHi Christian, \nDoes it always work like this in TE? Surely this makes no sense whatsoever, at least not for cases where matches from different TMs have the same percentage.\nThe whole reason people save content in different TMs and out them in a sequence is because they want to be able to ensure that the translation from TM AA is prioritized over the translation in TM BB when matches from the 2 TMs have the same match percentage. Applying the translation with the highest match percentage out of all the available TMs is fine, but when there are 2 matches with the same percentage from different TMs the translations from the first TM in the sequence, i.e. in TM AA,\u00a0would need to be prioritized, even if it has an older creation/modification date.\nFor example one of our cllients has split their content into multiple \"modules\". There is often a lot of overlap in the source content for these modules, but the translations for the same sopurce will have to be different in different modules. So the client decided to have separate TMs for each module,\u00a0and then to apply the TM for that specific module first in the sequence without a penalty while the TMs for the other modules get applied later on in the sequence.\nThe expectation is that this will ensure that if there is a translation in the first, module specific TM in the sequence, this will get reused as is while any translation from the TMs for the other modules will only get applied if there is no module-specific translation in the main TM.\nFor example,\u00a0\nlet\u2019s say we have a TU with the source text \u201cResources\u201d in both the 'Maintenance' module TM and the ;Finance' module TM.\nIn the Maintenance TM the translation is \u201cGrondstoffen\u201d, and this translation has been created/modified on the 1\nst\n of Jan 2025.\nAnd in Finance the translation is \u201cMiddelen\u201d, and this translation has been created/modified on the 2\nnd\n oyf Jan 2025 .\nThe expectations is that when we are applying the TMs to the Maintenance module, the translation from the Maintenance TM, namely \u201cGrondstoffen\u201d, would be applied, eventhoigh this has an older creation/modification date, as this is the translation specific to this module.\nBut what you are saying is that due to the way TMs in TE work, that\u2019s not what will happen as TE would apply the most recent translation, which is \u201cMiddelen\u201d from the Finance TM. Which would be wrong for the client.\nSo the TM apply logic should be:\n1. Apply highest match percentage\n2. If there are multiple matches from\u00a0diffferent TMs, apply the match from the TM that is highest up in the sequences\nCreated/modified date should have no relevance whatsoever\nIs there any chance this can be amended?\n\u00a0\nYou received this email because you are subscribed to a Weekly\u00a0Digest for this group.

We would like to know if we can change this default behaviour and avoid that Studio automatically switches the projects to \"In review\" status.\nThanks in advance.\nKR\n\u00d6zge\nJerzy Czopik\u00a0on\u00a07 Mar 2025 1:36 PM\nOf course you need to do a QA on your own translation. But again: it is YOU who changes the status of the segment. A modified segment has the status draft (or translation rejected or sign-off rejected) and that is a sign, something was wrong with it. This is work in progress. Before delivery you will usually accept all segments in either translation, review or sign-off process. Then your file will also have the right status. But during work in progress the status must be kept as it is.\nPlease don't take me wrong, but this is what makes TS so unique. You can follow all steps done and if you are being audited, this is also a way to show the auditor, if the file has really been revised.\nPhilippe Riondel\u00a0on\u00a07 Mar 2025 1:30 PM\nI support that suggestion. This is annoying, since after completing a translation, we\u00a0usually have to self revise it or to do some QA, and the project is not\u00a0yet \"In review\", from the translator's stand point.\nJerzy Czopik\u00a0on\u00a07 Mar 2025 1:29 PM\nThis is not Trados Studio, it is the user. If you change the status of just one segment to translation rejected or translation approved, Trados will treat the file then as being revised. This is a feature and should NOT be changed at all. You have trhee processes in TS: translation, revision and sign-off. Properly used these are great for keeping track of what has happened with file(s) in project. In your case simply make sure all segments have the same status, i.e. translated, translation approved or signed off. But there are a lot of situations, where you need to keep some segments in not translated status\u2014and in such cases the status of the file will of course show this.\n\u00a0\nFile preview in Editor view\nby\u00a0\nAna Benita Sanchez\n\u00a0on\u00a05 Mar 2025 9:28 AM\u00a0in\u00a0\nTrados Studio Ideas\nIt would be very useful if the Editor view from Trados Studio could have a preview pane which displays when hovering over each of the files, for example to see if they have been pre-translated without having to open them.

Trados Enterprise, Accelerate, Team & cloud capabilities in Studio\nNew\u00a0Questions\nTermbase on Trados live Team\nHi, We need to know how to activate the leverage analysis of internal fuzzy matches.\nQA checker restrictions visible for customer reviewers\nNew\u00a0Replies\nTranslation Engine Search Logic\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\nTrados 25.03.1 Release\nby\u00a0\nIan Parnell\n\u00a0on\u00a03 Mar 2025 4:36 PM\u00a0in\u00a0\nProduct Updates\nThe latest Trados release is now available and we\u00a0are excited\u00a0to share the new functionality that has been delivered.\n\u00a0\nNew features and updates are automatically added to your account so just log in to Trados and they will be available immediately.\n\u00a0\nWorkflow views\n(Applies to\n\u00a0\nTrados Team, Accelerate and Enterprise)\nPrior to this release, it was possible to view workflows and interact with them in two different ways: either as a vertical list of tasks and phases (the Vertical view) or as a horizontal representation (the Phases view)\u00a0that was introduced in late-2024. We announced at that time the Vertical view will be removed in an upcoming release.\nBased on customer feedback, we are introducing a new List view. The List view works similarly to the Phases view but presents tasks and phases as a vertical list for users that prefer this layout design.\nThe legacy Vertical view will be removed before the end of March 2025. We therefore encourage users to familiarize themselves with the Phases or List views prior to the Vertical view before removed.\nBatch replace files in Inbox\n(Applies to\n\u00a0\nTrados Team, Accelerate and Enterprise)\nWhen uploading files for accepted tasks from the Inbox, we have extended the automated file matching to check the Task ID from previous tasks.\nAs a practical example, a linguist downloads a file at the Translation task prior to completing the task. This linguist is then also assigned to the subsequent Linguistic Review task, and they upload the same file they downloaded at the earlier Translation task, as it may be more efficient to implement changes in the previous file.\nIf the linguist now uploads the previous file, it will now be automatically matched, despite the Task ID in the file coming from the earlier Translation task.\nIn this scenario, users will be presented with a warning message to explain how the match was identified and to only proceed if this is their intended action, to help prevent human error.\nAnalysis statistics in Inbox\n(Applies to\n\u00a0\nTrados Team, Accelerate and Enterprise)\nWe now include a breakdown of the analysis statistics in the Inbox, so users with tasks assigned to them can easily access this information to help manage and prioritize their workload. Each category from the analysis statistics is displayed as a separate column from a user\u2019s Inbox, with the exception of fuzzy matches which are aggregated into a single column. \nNote: the analysis statistics are only displayed for tasks that are based at target file level and for tasks created following this release.\u00a0The columns will\u00a0appear empty for tasks that were created prior to this release.\nAd-hoc cost type for Pricing Models\n(Applies to\n\u00a0\nTrados Accelerate and Enterprise)\nWe have introduced a new Ad-hoc cost type for Pricing Models that can be used when you want to include a flat cost that isn\u2019t dependent on any other variable in a project, such as the word or page count. Where configured, an Ad-hoc cost can be set implicitly in the original Pricing Model or added during the Customer Quote Review or Vendor Quote Review tasks.\nVendor\u00a0Pricing Models\n(Applies to\n\u00a0\nTrados Accelerate and Enterprise)\nWe have introduced greater flexibility in vendor pricing models to support costs based on a service type.\nPrior to this release, it was already possible to create additional language costs in vendor pricing models based on a service type. With the release, you can also now create additional project costs based on a service type.\nIn addition, you can also define service type costs at language level by entering a cost for each of the bands contained in the pricing model.\nQuote templates for Vendors\n(Applies to\n\u00a0\nTrados Accelerate and Enterprise)\nIt is\u00a0now possible to apply quote templates to vendor quotes. \n\u00a0\nQuote templates allow you to adapt the format and layout of a quote, by\u00a0including your own logo and controlling which information and content should be included. For more information on quote templates, please consult the original release \nannouncement\n or product \ndocumentation\n. In addition, sample quote templates can be found under the Files section in the Trados \nCommunity\n.\n\u00a0\nTo apply quote templates for vendors, you should first create the quote template in the usual manner from the Resources section under the Pricing menu. Once available, you can then associate a quote template with a vendor from the \nVendor > Settings\n page, so this is applied to quotes from that vendor.\n\u00a0\nCustom Reporting updates\n(Applies to\n\u00a0\nTrados Accelerate and Enterprise)\nImage component in Custom Reporting\nReport authors can now upload images directly from their local desktop to QuickSight for a variety of use cases, such as adding company logos and branding, including background images with free-form layout, and creating captivating story covers. This feature also supports tooltip and alt text, providing additional context and accessibility for consumers. Furthermore, it offers navigation and URL actions, enabling authors to make their images interactive, such as triggering specific dashboard actions when the image is clicked.\nFont Customization for Visuals\nThe Custom Reporting module in Trados now supports the ability to customize fonts across specific visuals. Authors can completely customize fonts for Table and Pivot table visuals, while for remaining visuals, they can customize fonts for specific properties including the title, subtitle, legends title and legends values. \nAuthors can set the font size (in pixels), font family, color, and styling options like bold, italics, and underline. With this update, you can align the dashboard's fonts with your organization's branding guidelines, creating a cohesive and visually appealing experience. Additionally, the font customization options can help improve the readability and meet accessibility standards, especially when viewing visuals on a large screen.\nCustom Reporting Workshop\nLater this year, we will be hosting a Custom Reporting workshop as part of our ELEVATE conference, the localization industry's largest online event. This will be of particular interest to report authors working in Trados and help customers unlock the full potential of our custom reporting module. ELEVATE is taking place between the 6-8th May 2025, and you can secure your place at the event by registering \nhere\n.\nAPI\u00a0updates\nAlthough there are no \nchanges to the \nAPI this time, we would like to \ninform \nusers that \nthe \nAPI Keys\n mechanism is being deprecated\n. It will no longer be possible to create new \nAPI Keys\n and users should employ the \nApplication\n \nmethodology\n going forward.\n To keep \nup to date\n with \nAPI changes, \nwe recommend checking with the \nWhat\u2019s New\n page \nregularly to get \nmore details.\nPublic API: UI Extensibility beta\nAs announced previously, we have introduced support for User Interface (UI) Extensions which offer the possibility to add custom user interface elements and functionality. Custom buttons and panels can be added to specific places within the user interface.\n \nUI Extensibility is initially being offered in BETA. Customers interested in evaluating this functionality should keep in mind that significant changes are planned prior to the full release. For more details, please refer to the \ndocumentation\n page.\n\u00a0\nAdditional\u00a0changes\nWhen choosing to include termbases when downloading a package, we now only include termbases that contain language pairs corresponding to the selected tasks\n\u00a0\nUsers can download a report including a full audit trail of changes made to the project due date.\n\u00a0\nUsers can change task due dates during project creation in Trados. This feature is supported when using the Phases or List workflow views and is only available to users with the \nProjects > Planning\n permission.\n\u00a0\nThe Service Status page is now directly accessible from the Help & Documentation menu in the Trados user interface.\n\u00a0\nVarious bug fixes and UX enhancements\n\u00a0\nFinally, I would like to draw your attention to a recent webinar summarizing the new features delivered in Trados during 2024. If you missed the live webinar or would like to watch a recap of the features that were delivered over the last 12 months, you can access the recording \nhere\n.\u00a0\nBy registering for access to this recording, you will also receive invitations to\u00a0future Trados webinars. \n\u00a0\nTrados Product Management\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\nTermbase on Trados live Team\nby\u00a0\nMarianna Leporini\n\u00a0on\u00a06 Mar 2025 8:55 PM\u00a0in\u00a0\n2.

Then the results are returned based on the match value. For results with the same\u00a0value, we sort them by the TM order, then by the dates.\nNeeltje Stuurman\u00a0on\u00a03 Mar 2025 9:26 AM\nHi Christian, \nDoes it always work like this in TE? Surely this makes no sense whatsoever, at least not for cases where matches from different TMs have the same percentage.\nThe whole reason people save content in different TMs and out them in a sequence is because they want to be able to ensure that the translation from TM AA is prioritized over the translation in TM BB when matches from the 2 TMs have the same match percentage. Applying the translation with the highest match percentage out of all the available TMs is fine, but when there are 2 matches with the same percentage from different TMs the translations from the first TM in the sequence, i.e. in TM AA,\u00a0would need to be prioritized, even if it has an older creation/modification date.\nFor example one of our cllients has split their content into multiple \"modules\". There is often a lot of overlap in the source content for these modules, but the translations for the same sopurce will have to be different in different modules. So the client decided to have separate TMs for each module,\u00a0and then to apply the TM for that specific module first in the sequence without a penalty while the TMs for the other modules get applied later on in the sequence.\nThe expectation is that this will ensure that if there is a translation in the first, module specific TM in the sequence, this will get reused as is while any translation from the TMs for the other modules will only get applied if there is no module-specific translation in the main TM.\nFor example,\u00a0\nlet\u2019s say we have a TU with the source text \u201cResources\u201d in both the 'Maintenance' module TM and the ;Finance' module TM.\nIn the Maintenance TM the translation is \u201cGrondstoffen\u201d, and this translation has been created/modified on the 1\nst\n of Jan 2025.\nAnd in Finance the translation is \u201cMiddelen\u201d, and this translation has been created/modified on the 2\nnd\n oyf Jan 2025 .\nThe expectations is that when we are applying the TMs to the Maintenance module, the translation from the Maintenance TM, namely \u201cGrondstoffen\u201d, would be applied, eventhoigh this has an older creation/modification date, as this is the translation specific to this module.\nBut what you are saying is that due to the way TMs in TE work, that\u2019s not what will happen as TE would apply the most recent translation, which is \u201cMiddelen\u201d from the Finance TM. Which would be wrong for the client.\nSo the TM apply logic should be:\n1. Apply highest match percentage\n2. If there are multiple matches from\u00a0diffferent TMs, apply the match from the TM that is highest up in the sequences\nCreated/modified date should have no relevance whatsoever\nIs there any chance this can be amended?\n\u00a0\nYou received this email because you are subscribed to a Weekly\u00a0Digest for this group.

We would like to know if we can change this default behaviour and avoid that Studio automatically switches the projects to \"In review\" status.\nThanks in advance.\nKR\n\u00d6zge\nJerzy Czopik\u00a0on\u00a07 Mar 2025 1:36 PM\nOf course you need to do a QA on your own translation. But again: it is YOU who changes the status of the segment. A modified segment has the status draft (or translation rejected or sign-off rejected) and that is a sign, something was wrong with it. This is work in progress. Before delivery you will usually accept all segments in either translation, review or sign-off process. Then your file will also have the right status. But during work in progress the status must be kept as it is.\nPlease don't take me wrong, but this is what makes TS so unique. You can follow all steps done and if you are being audited, this is also a way to show the auditor, if the file has really been revised.\nPhilippe Riondel\u00a0on\u00a07 Mar 2025 1:30 PM\nI support that suggestion. This is annoying, since after completing a translation, we\u00a0usually have to self revise it or to do some QA, and the project is not\u00a0yet \"In review\", from the translator's stand point.\nJerzy Czopik\u00a0on\u00a07 Mar 2025 1:29 PM\nThis is not Trados Studio, it is the user. If you change the status of just one segment to translation rejected or translation approved, Trados will treat the file then as being revised. This is a feature and should NOT be changed at all. You have trhee processes in TS: translation, revision and sign-off. Properly used these are great for keeping track of what has happened with file(s) in project. In your case simply make sure all segments have the same status, i.e. translated, translation approved or signed off. But there are a lot of situations, where you need to keep some segments in not translated status\u2014and in such cases the status of the file will of course show this.\n\u00a0\nFile preview in Editor view\nby\u00a0\nAna Benita Sanchez\n\u00a0on\u00a05 Mar 2025 9:28 AM\u00a0in\u00a0\nTrados Studio Ideas\nIt would be very useful if the Editor view from Trados Studio could have a preview pane which displays when hovering over each of the files, for example to see if they have been pre-translated without having to open them.

I can extract the .sdlxliff documents from the .wsxz packages, j...\nS\u00e9bastien Desautel\u00a0on\u00a025 Feb 2025 10:30 PM\nHello Jean-Fran\u00e7ois,\nyes, this is correct. and yes: 1. import the sdlxliff in a new project, 2. import the TMX in TMs (that are already set up in the translation engine to make this easy) and 3. start the project/workflow to\u00a0get the analysis from TE.\nThe analysis algorithms are not exactly the same in TE and WS so you must expect some differences between the respective reports when only the TMX are leveraged.\nKind regards\nS\u00e9bastien\nJean-Fran\u00e7ois Pelletier\u00a0on\u00a024 Feb 2025 7:17 PM\nThanks again, S\u00e9bastien!\nIt's all clear and it makes sense. Can I ask for one more clarification if you don't mind? From what I understand, the .SDLXLIF files won't contain any fuzzy matches. So it means that if we reanalyze the files with the TMX included, we could (and should) leverage more fuzzy matches for the translators, correct? So the process would be to import the .SDLXIFF and the TMX, reanalyze the files and generate new reports?\nKind regards,\nJF\nS\u00e9bastien Desautel\u00a0on\u00a024 Feb 2025 6:27 PM\nHello Jean-Fran\u00e7ois,\nTT will recognize the 100% matches (or better) as translated. For the untranslated segments, you\u00a0can do whatever you want, like for a standard file: use your own settings (TM and/or MT) to pretranslate them, and yes this can be done with other fuzzy match categories.\u00a0\nOne thing you won't be able to change is the segmentation.\nIf you would like to leverage the segments exported as tmx, you will have to import them in the TM used for the analysis.\nUse \"Always overwrite existing translation\" or \"Overwrite existing translation if better match found.\" if the sdlxliff files are pretranslated with fuzzy matches and you want to prioritize your assets over WS pretranslation.\u00a0\nWS pretranslation below 100% won't be taken into account in the analysis at all. The segments will be simply pretranslated and without any match in your TT TM, these segments will be counted as \"new match\" in the analysis.\nKind regards\nS\u00e9bastien\nJean-Fran\u00e7ois Pelletier\u00a0on\u00a024 Feb 2025 4:49 PM\nThanks, \nDaniel Brockmann\n\u00a0!\nI'm working with the API and SnapLogic to automate the tasks as much as possible, so no manual steps such as opening the packages in Studio. I know that the API has limitations, so my questions\u00a0are\u00a0really more about finding those limitations before they block me.\nKind regards,\nJF\nJean-Fran\u00e7ois Pelletier\u00a0on\u00a024 Feb 2025 4:45 PM\nHello \nSebastien Desautel\n\u00a0,\nThanks a lot for your input! I also found out that the files seem to be processed very straight forward, and that the delivery packages are nothing else than the zipped .sdlxliff files.\nI have another question if you don't mind (and if \nDaniel Brockmann\n\u00a0 doesn't delete your reply...\u00a0\n\ud83d\ude09\n ) : The source files are already pre-translated and populated, however the source file packages also contain .tmx files and some reporting data. How flexible is TT in case we need to re-apply MT, TM, and re-analyze using a different fuzzy matches breakdown category?\nKind regards,\nJF\nDaniel Brockmann\u00a0on\u00a024 Feb 2025 10:08 AM\nSorry \nSebastien Desautel\n\u00a0 - I inadvertently deleted your answer, apologies! Here it is again:\n\"Hello Jean-Fran\u00e7ois,\nI worked on a similar project:\u00a0the flow of the sdlxliff files in Trados Team is comparable to any other files. You can upload them in a new project and let them go through a standard workflow. TT detects the language direction of each file and will only prepare the file for the dedicated direction. You just have to take care that all language directions are available in the project template you are using, otherwise some sdlxliff files will be set as reference.\nFor the delivery, the translated files can be zipped and uploaded to WorldServer (I believe .zip extension is fine). That's at least what worked on the WS server we worked on. WS can\u00a0find the internal path to upload the files through their metadata. So you don't have to create a specific return package. \nAs far as I can remember, you can also zip files from different projects together and upload them at once.\nKind regards\nS\u00e9bastien\"\nS\u00e9bastien Desautel\u00a0on\u00a024 Feb 2025 10:04 AM\nHello Jean-Fran\u00e7ois,\nI worked on a similar project:\u00a0the flow of the sdlxliff files in Trados Team is comparable to any other files.

You can also continue the SDLXLIFF extraction route, in that case you would need to manually replace the translated SDLXLIFF files in your local project target language folders after delivery.

You may have a 95% match in your Memory AA but if you have a higher match in Memory BB or Memory CC, that will be suggested. If you have 2 matches with the same percentage in different TMs, the most recent one (Created on or Modified on) will be suggested.\nI hope this helps!

However, this customization does not stick: once we go out of that project and come back to it, the customization is gone. In addition, this customization has to be carried out each time for each project, whereas users might have always the same needs regardless of the project. So it would be useful is Trados Enterprise UI could remember the customization per user (so across the board, for all projects).\n\u00a0\nSorting by \"project due date\" in the Inbox\nby\u00a0\nCAMELIA GHEORGHIES\n\u00a0on\u00a027 Feb 2025 12:54 PM\u00a0in\u00a0\nTrados Enterprise & Accelerate Ideas\nWould it be possible to activate the sort by \"project due date\" in the Inbox?

There is strong internal demand for more granular access control to enable efficient termbase maintenance while preventing unintended modifications to restricted termbases.\n\u00a0\nImprove overall Vendor profiling\nby\u00a0\nThomas Alwood\n\u00a0on\u00a025 Feb 2025 3:47 PM\u00a0in\u00a0\nTrados Enterprise & Accelerate Ideas\nThe information you can record in Enterprise regarding vendors is currently limited basically to name, email and pricing. In the past 20 years there has been a revolution in the translation industry in regards to vendor management include information such as quality metrics, registration steps, availability and other metadata which help Project Managers assign the best vendor to a task. Currently we have to manage this information outside of Enterprise which is very inconvenient. These are now pretty standard features in most Translation Business Management Systems.\n\u00a0\nShow Profile languages in Groups\nby\u00a0\nBernhard Hoell\n\u00a0on\u00a024 Feb 2025 12:36 PM\u00a0in\u00a0\nTrados Enterprise & Accelerate Ideas\nCurrently the assigned languages for service types are only visible if you edit the user account - this is a problem:\nDue to SSO integration, all our users are created at ROOT level and then added to different groups, after they have been given respective service types and language pair configurations to allow assigning the group and use the flexible workflow assignment.\nI have full access to the users profiles, translation lead project managers on subsequent customer folders however may not even see which languages the users are able to handle.\nIt would be really useful to allow the Groups view that shows all users in a certain group to contain not only the name and email, but to contain the assigned languages and service types for those users likewise.\nThis would make it easier for the Lead PJMs to check if they have users for all relevant languages before they use the group based workflow assignment that takes into account the service type and language configuration.\n\u00a0\nNew comments on\nMachine Translation step: Choose \"MT for pretranslation\" or \"MT for lookup\"\n\u00a0by\u00a0\nVera Malysheva\n\u00a0on\u00a023 Jan 2025 3:49 PM\u00a0in\u00a0\nTrados Enterprise & Accelerate Ideas\nCurrently, if you create a new project and add an MT provider to your Translation Engine, the MT will be automatically pre-filled into the segments.

You can find it View > Options (Settings).\nThis was a great first step, but I still\u00a0suggested\u00a0some changes to this feature. As the feature is currently enabled by default, this would mean that we as the owners of the MT engine would still need to request every single user of the Online Editor to disable this automatic application of MT. While disabling the setting might be a one-time requirement, the problem remains that we cannot guarantee that the linguist does not re-enable it on their own and our team would have no way to restrict that.\nI suggested\u00a0that they make this feature toggle to be part of the project settings. That way, project creators or managers can decide to enable or disable such a feature right from the very start, rather than letting it propagate to users of all target languages. This level of control would be much more helpful.\nI can update this thread once I see any new updates.\n\u00a0\nNew comments on\nAdd segment number to verification messages\n\u00a0by\u00a0\nRussell Banton\n\u00a0on\u00a030 Dec 2024 5:26 PM\u00a0in\u00a0\nTrados Enterprise & Accelerate Ideas\n\u00a0When clicking through the verification messages, the OE doesn't always go to the correct segment.

While there are some ways to have tags created in the target side of the Online Editor, it is still lacking a copy and paste action for the tagging. This also impacts when we have to validate a translation externally from TE. When we try to copy a segment that includes tags, the tags are lost upon copy and paste which makes us have to manually type them. This can be cumbersome for some segments that have a lot of tags.\nPatrik Mazanek\u00a0on\u00a025 Feb 2025 8:12 AM\nAnother way to copy tags from source is simply CTRL+click on the tag you want to copy.\n\u00a0\nNew comments on\nAdd ability to filter and download reports from the vendor orders and quotes views\n\u00a0by\u00a0\nRussell Banton\n\u00a0on\u00a017 Nov 2023 9:27 PM\u00a0in\u00a0\nTrados Enterprise & Accelerate Ideas\nAdding the ability to filter by start date, customer, etc. and then download a report with the data will enable a vendor to easily\u00a0get a report for their work they supported.\nRussell Banton\u00a0on\u00a025 Feb 2025 1:17 PM\nThank you for the update Ian!

But I also agree with \nBernhard Hoell\n\u00a0 who found out that the feature doesn't work as expected. I would also have expected a Studio package to contain only bilingual termbases. However, if the project contains more or all target languages, the feature no longer helps the user.\u00a0We had also observed loading times of approx. 45 minutes and these are probably unavoidable with termbases with a large number of languages. This makes the work very time-consuming, especially if the package does not contain that many words for translation.\n\u00a0\nNew comments on\nEmbedded Content Processing for JSON should line-breaks without segment break\n\u00a0by\u00a0\nFrank Lempp\n\u00a0on\u00a019 Jan 2024 8:15 AM\u00a0in\u00a0\nTrados Studio Ideas\nIf a JSON file contains inline tags to be protected, it should still be possible to create a single segment from a multi-line string resource, just the way it is possible without enabling Embedded Con...\nFrank Lempp\u00a0on\u00a024 Feb 2025 10:52 AM\nThere is obviously the work-around to replace \"\\n\" by \"\\\\n\" (or something similar) in the JSON file before importing it into Studio or Trados Cloud, but a corresponding enhancement directly in the filter is urgently needed!\n\u00a0\nBe able to connect Multiterm to cloud termbase\nby\u00a0\nThomas Alwood\n\u00a0on\u00a025 Feb 2025 3:26 PM\u00a0in\u00a0\nTrados Terminology Ideas\nRight now you can connect Studio to a cloud termbase but not Multiterm, although you can connect to server-based termbases in GroupShare. It would be usefult to connect to cloud termbases as well as Multiterm has feature useful for maintaining termbases (duplicate searchs, batch tasks etc). Also would be useful to allow Multiterm Extract to connect to cloud termbases.

    "body": "Celebrating 10 Years of Learning\nwith us!\nBonjou Maya!\n\u00a0\nAs we continue celebrating Creole Solutions\u2019 10-year journey, this month\u2019s spotlight is on \nLearning\n, \none of the most powerful ways we\u2019ve seen Haitian Creole break barriers and open doors.\n\u00a0\nFor too long, higher education and professional research in Haiti were associated almost exclusively with French, leaving Haitian Creole on the sidelines. But that\u2019s changing, and Creole Solutions has played an active role in this shift.\nIn 2022, The United Nations launched its new website for Haiti in Haitian Creole.\nWhat is possible? \nLearning!\nHistorically, higher learning in Haiti has been associated with French, as Haitian Creole was considered a spoken language. That perspective has undergone quite a few changes in the last decade, and \nCreole Solutions\n is proud to have played a role in this shift.\n \n\u00a0\nWhat learning is and how it is accessed have evolved\n, with Haitian Creole gaining greater recognition. When the New York Times published an article on Haitian history in both English and Haitian Creole on May 23, 2022, it caused a sensation.\nLater in the same year, the \nUnited Nations\n launched its brand-new website for Haiti \nin beautifully crafted Haitian Creole. Marleen and her team have always felt strongly that Haitian Creole can only be elevated by prioritizing proper grammar and spelling. \nThese days, it is not uncommon for research institutes and museums to request translations from us.\u00a0\n\u00a0\nWe were honored to collaborate with the Museum of Contemporary Art to include Haitian Creole translations in \nDidier William: Nou Kite Tout Sa D\u00e8y\u00e8\n.\n This powerful book, published alongside William\u2019s largest solo museum exhibition, delves into race, immigration, and memory through his monumental paintings, printmaking, and sculpture.\n \nThe title, which translates to \nWe\u2019ve Left That All Behind\n, reflects the Haitian immigrant experience\u2014the journey of displacement, adaptation, and resilience. By incorporating Haitian Creole, we ensure that these narratives reach those who connect most deeply with them, reinforcing the idea that language should never be a barrier to understanding.\nIn Haitian culture, we say\n \nKrey\u00f2l pale, krey\u00f2l konprann\n\u2014\nwhen Creole is spoken, it is understood. When people have the opportunity to learn and engage in their own language, knowledge becomes more accessible, voices are amplified, and communities thrive.\n \nCelebrate with Us!\n\u00a0\nFrom academic research to museum exhibitions, our language is breaking barriers and creating new opportunities. Every translation, publication, and collaboration brings us closer to a future where\n Creole is not just spoken but recognized, studied, and celebrated.\n\u00a0\nWhat\u2019s Next?\nEach month, we\u2019ll share another story of what\u2019s possible with Haitian Creole, celebrating the growth, creativity, and cultural pride that Creole Solutions has brought to life over the past decade.\n\u00a0\nJoin us in championing Haitian Creole as a language of learning, knowledge, and innovation. Share your thoughts, stories, and experiences with us\u2014because when \nKrey\u00f2l pale, krey\u00f2l konprann\n, anything is possible!\nLearn more about us\n \nStay in the loop!\nFor more updates and exciting news, make sure to follow our page and stay connected with us on social media.\u00a0\n \n \n \n \nCreole Solutions, 4957 Oakton Street, Suite 203, Skokie, IL 60076, United States \nManage preferences",

The model/information exposed under Get Project is described at \nhttps://languagecloud.sdl.com/lc/api-docs/4d1cce730f2af-analysis-statistics\n. Locked segments information is not yet exposed, we have a feature request for this down the road.\nIn addition to this, when executing the call, you could request via query parameter \nfields=analysisStatistics,languageDirections.analysisStatistics\n, either if you want the whole project statistics, or language direction level statistics. On the response then with minimal parsing/navigating logic, the data should be available.\u201d\nWould the second paragraph help with your second question in terms of language level?\nThanks, Daniel\n\u00a0\nI want to create new role for my students to translate, but I dont have the section ROLES&PERMIS...\nby\u00a0\nAlbino Chavale\n\u00a0on\u00a016 Feb 2025 2:47 PM\u00a0in\u00a0\n1.

Because the file is actually constantly updated on the cloud, so it would be also logical that the time stamp is also continuously updated. In addition, once a task is completed, users would expect to see the timestamp of the task completion rather than the task creation timestamp. Otherwise, when people are looking for their files, they might have doubts about whether the system recorded the right file.\nWould you please consider displaying an updated timestamp?

That would visibly make it a lot easier and much fun to spot projects immediately, especially if you are dealing with so many clients. This should be easy, I believe.

There should be a way to make it bigger.\nGenerally speaking, anything that could be done to make Trados visually comfortable would be nice.\nPlease note I use Trados 2021 and I have no intention of upgrading. I already did and had to roll back because of issues in the interaction between Trados and Multiterm. I would love a solution for comments that could be applied to all Trados versions.\nPhilippe Riondel\u00a0on\u00a018 Feb 2025 12:34 PM\nI already suggested that idea 2-3 years ago (\n(+) Comment box font size - Trados Studio Ideas - Trados Portfolio Ideas - RWS Community\n). \nThis really a must for people whose vision is not 20/20. Yet, nobody at RWS seems to be interested in improving that point.\nIt's a non-sense, since Studio developers understand it\u00a0is necessary for many\u00a0users to enlarge the fonts in the editor, but they don't il is also necessary in the comment box.\u00a0How would\u00a0people\u00a0who specified a minimum font size of 14 in the editor suddenly be able to decipher\u00a0mice print in the comment box?\nPaul\u00a0on\u00a017 Feb 2025 9:01 AM\nJerzy Czopik\n\u00a0\nJose Ignacio Cepero Briz\n\u00a0\nWhy don't you try using the online editor?\u00a0 This is available to every Studio user, it has an accessibility mode, and you can also control the size of the things you look at far easier:\nor bigger... just by scrolling:\nOlivier\u00a0on\u00a017 Feb 2025 6:48 AM\nHi. I completely agree with you. For example, the left panel in Multiterm has a tiny font size, almost impossible to read. I have good eyesight, so it's OK for me, but accessibility should be a priority in any software.\nJerzy Czopik\u00a0on\u00a016 Feb 2025 8:17 AM\nIf you have problems with MultiTerm, upgrade to 2024. This version has a much more stable term recognition. As for your font suggestion, I think there have been already some proposals in similar direction. Having the possibility to adapt font sizes in auto suggest or comments and other parts of Studio is indeed a very desirable idea.\n\u00a0\nNew comments on\nRefine the measurement checks\n\u00a0by\u00a0\nDiana Palenzuela\n\u00a0on\u00a012 Feb 2025 1:16 PM\u00a0in\u00a0\nTrados Studio Ideas\nHi, Trados Community!

The regex would be \n\\bcm\\b\n.\nOr you can combine as many symbols as you wish \n\\b(mm|cm|ml|L|l|g|mmHg)\\b\n or even full words (for example, if \nhour\n is in Source, there must be \nhora\n in the Spanish target; similar for seconds, minutes, days, weeks, months, years).\u00a0\nYou can add rules for checking numbers too.\nAbout the issue with \nL\n and \nl\n symbols, I\u2019m not sure about that, but I think that the measurement \nL\n expects \nL\n in target, while \nl\n symbol expects \nl\n. Again you can add a regex rule that if \\\nb[Ll]\\b\n is matched in Source, \n\\bl\\b\n must be matched in Target (case sensitive).\nI have it in that way, literally hundred of regex rules per target language, and some checks in Verifier turned off. It\u2019s true that I get some unavoidable false positives, but really very few. A couple of manageable false positives is a minor collateral damage while assuring that days are not translated as years, for example.\nI hope it helps.

This locks the file, preventing others from editing it.\nStep 2: Translator A works on the file and then checks it back in when they're done. This updates the file in the project and unlocks it.\nStep 3: Another student (Translator B) can now check out the file and see the changes made by Translator A. They can then make their own edits without overwriting Translator A's work.\nStep 4: Translator B checks the file back in when they're done, updating the project file with their changes.\nThis process can be repeated with as many translators as needed. Each translator's work is preserved and visible to others when they check out the file.\nRemember to always check in the file after you're done working on it to ensure your changes are saved and visible to others.\nI hope this answer addressed your question.

The development team at Trados is always working to improve the user experience, and feedback like yours is invaluable in guiding these improvements. I recommend keeping your software up to date to benefit from the latest features and improvements.\nIn the meantime, you can use the current visual indicators (inability to write in segments and the greyed out 'Confirm Changes' button) to identify when you have read-only access.\nI hope this answer addressed your question.

Studio already identifies terms or phrases coming from termbases, and so we would like to use this to mark the source files up, export the file onto .docx and use it for offline projects. This process currently takes up to 3 hours per 70-page file, as one of the reference materials contains 30k+ terms, so we believe we can greatly improve efficiency with a Studio-based process.\nBefore you suggest it: no, our client is not prepared to use Studio for the translations themselves. There are a few operational difficulties as we deal with updates (so, tracked changes) and have had CAPAs in the past. We are only looking at adapting our offline process for now.\nThank you!\n\u00a0\nRefine the measurement checks\nby\u00a0\nDiana Palenzuela\n\u00a0on\u00a012 Feb 2025 1:16 PM\u00a0in\u00a0\nTrados Studio Ideas\nHi, Trados Community!\nIt would be of great help if the measurement checks (Verification > QA checker 3.0 > Numbers >\u00a0Check measurements and currencies) was refined. Errors in units of measurements result in major/critical feedback from RI clients, with good reason - patients getting the wrong dose of the medicine, for instance.\nThe current in-built checker only checks measurements when they appear together with a digit, but that's not how all units of measurement appear in files: you can get, for example, a request to 'report the length of your rash in cm' or tables in which the table header includes the units of measurement so that each cell doesn't include it (this is standard practice in STEM), as well as axes, graphs, and a myriad other scenarios.\nFurthermore, the current feature will warn that \"measurement is missing in target segment or is not properly localised\" where the source contains a number and a UoM but the target only contains a UoM: source: 5 cm/target: cm. In this case, this is a false positive as there is no problem with the units of measurement, only with the numbers. If both the numbers and units of measurement are activated in the Verify, then you get duplicated warnings. The number and unit of measurement checks should be independent, only getting a warning for numbers if there's a number mismatch; and only getting a warning for measurements if there's a UoM mismatch.\nIt also seems that the measurements aren't properly localised - is there a way to customise this? I have an en-es-ES file and it's showing a warning where the source is 5 g/L while the target is 5 g/l - in Spanish for Spain, the symbol for 'litres' is an upper case 'l,' so this is correct.\nDiana Palenzuela\u00a0on\u00a014 Feb 2025 8:38 AM\nSorry, small correction here as I don't seem to be able to edit:\u00a0\nIt also seems that the measurements aren't properly localised - is there a way to customise this?
