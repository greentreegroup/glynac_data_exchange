    "message": "I have a couple questions for you regarding LCW\u2019s train-the trainer program. Would Voya need to pay for the site license and the training sessions? Yes, the Train-the-Trainer program consist of two components the site license and the TTT sessions. The site licenses are priced as follows: - Content for 1-2 hr courses \u200b- $35,000 per course - Content for 3-8 hr courses \u200b- $60,000 per course Then the cost of the TTT training session is additional. See below for details on 1 vs 2 day TTT training sessions. NOTE - Site licenses are not currently available for some courses including LCW Cultural Immersions and select Cultural Competence Workshops-but if you have great interest in those, we can talk about doing those if the total spend is large enough (i.e. over $1.5m) What is the difference between the one & two day sessions? Would that be a decision we make on which one we go with? Is there a maximum number of trainers we can have trained for the fee? The difference between the one & two day sessions is based on the length of the content. Details and investment amounts: - One Day TTT Program (for 1-2 hr courses) - $20,000 - INCLUDES: Live Course Delivery + Walkthrough of each piece of content + Teachbacks - Two Day TTT Program (for 3-8 hr courses) - $40,000 - INCLUDES: Day 1: Live Course Delivery + Walkthrough of each piece of content\u200b with Q&A and Day 2 : Teachbacks, practice, and Q&A - LCW can accom m odate up to 10 candidate trainers in each session. Did you provide me with a cost for our Unconscious Bias training (4 hour session)? An off-the-shelf 4-hour session with two facilitators delivering LCW\u2019s UB content is $15,000. Additional Workshop Customizations to adapt content to client\u2019s specific audience (e.g., industry, region, country, or global) or learning objectives are available. When being designed for a firm wide rollout, the typical cost is about $20k for the customization of a \u2018global\u2019 version. Additional customizations for specific world regions or parts of the business range are typically starting at $3,000",

    "message": "What are the differences between these courses? - Managing Bias is the Workplace is for Individual Contributors - It assumes in the group that there is a chunk of non-managers. - Individual contributors and non-managers should not be in same succession because this creates a greater awareness of inherent organizational issues with hiring. - Leaders would only go through this program if goal were to have a common conversation \u2013 will only address things that everyone can touch. - Does not solve for any leadership issues. - Managing Bias in Talent Management - The general course that illumines bias and all the way that impacts people decisions. - Covers hiring, team meetings, performance reviews. - Managing Bias in Talent Review - Only for leaders doing succession planning and making more strategic hiring decisions. Ideally, put leaders through Managing Bias is the Workplace and Managing Bias in Talent Management . The opportunity for both allows leaders to understand what followers are learning and learn Managing Bias in Talent Management is best approach.",
