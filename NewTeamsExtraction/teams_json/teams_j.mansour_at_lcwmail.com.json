On one hand the edits (to content) remain relatively the same; however, on the others the changes are significant, but mostly structural. I'm proposing some significant re organization. This is because while our recommendations remain basically the same, I wanted to create a more clear and singular narrative. This process also helped me identify the redundancies that have been mentioned and hopefully eliminate them while making the relationship between recommendations more evident.",
