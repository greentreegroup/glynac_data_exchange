Hope you are also fine.\nBelow are the responses to your questions.\n1.What courses have you been asked to deliver?\nResponse:\nI have been asked for micro learning and spotlight courses (first draft done by me and waiting for Andrea and Chuck feedbacks)\nFor spotlight , I have done for Neuro diversity and Randall is working with me.\na) Do these courses have deadlines for completion?\nResponse:\nNot sure, but I do need to know the timeline.\nb) Are any courses priority over others?\nResponse:\nPriority is microlearning and spotlights\n2. How long does it take you, on average, to turn an existing LCW training (from PPT) into an elearning or microloearning?\nResponse:\neLearning takes more time compare to microlearning.\n3.Are you using Rise or Storyline?\nResponse:\nI use Rise for microlearning and Storyline for eLearning courses.\n4. How long would it take you, on average, to create a new microlearning from scratch (assuming the course is around 30 minutes or less)?\nFor an average microlearning course will take 25-30 hours 30 mins courses. It can be less as well, if I provided with images.\nYou can assume someone from LCW would work with you on the content, as a subject matter expert\n5.Does Rise and/or Storyline allow for translation into other languages?\nIf Yes, is this something you can do? (We would have professional translators review for accuracy)\nIf No, do you know of a workaround (ex: translating outside of Rise/Storyline & then importing the translation)\nResponse\nIt is possible in both, just I need translation document and voiceover.it takes 50-60% time with comparing to original time taken for English language. But it is not too tough. I can do easily\nPlease let me know if you need anything\u00a0else\nThanks,\nArvin\nFrom:\n Nicole Barile <n.barile@lcwmail.com>\nSent:\n Thursday, February 13, 2025 11:07 PM\nTo:\n Arvinder Kaur <a.kaur@lcwmail.com>\nSubject:\n Questions about building new Microlearnings\n \n\u00a0\nHello Arvin,\nI hope you're having a great week!\nI know you have shared much of this information with Chuck already, but if you can answer the following questions, it would\u00a0be greatly appreciated.\nWhat courses have you been asked to deliver?\nDo these courses have deadlines for completion?\nAre any courses priority over others?\nHow long does it take you, on average, to turn an existing LCW training (from PPT) into an elearning or microloearning?\nAre you using Rise or Storyline?\nHow long would it take you, on average, to create a new microlearning from scratch (assuming the course is around 30 minutes or less)?\nYou can assume someone from LCW would work with you on the content, as a subject matter expert\nDoes Rise and/or Storyline allow for translation into other languages?\nIf Yes, is this something you can do?

How long does it take you, on average, to turn an existing LCW training (from PPT) into an elearning or microloearning?\nResponse:\neLearning takes more time compare to microlearning.\n3.Are you using Rise or Storyline?\nResponse:\nI use Rise for microlearning and Storyline for eLearning courses.\n4. How long would it take you, on average, to create a new microlearning from scratch (assuming the course is around 30 minutes or less)?\nFor an average microlearning course will take 25-30 hours 30 mins courses.

Any tweaks you might have, at this stage, would also be welcome. Unlike a video, luckily, changing the narration at any point is really easy, as it doesn\u2019t modify the timing of animations or anything.\n\u00a0\nHey Arvinder,\nAs Rebecca reviews this, feel free to get started on building out the first version of the course (it\u2019s also saved in your inbox folder, of course). Changes to narration should not have a huge impact.\u00a0 There are several places where an interactive learning activity is needed \u2013 I have not dictated what type they should be, so please design/develop your best ideas and we can connect after.\n\u00a0\nAny questions, please let me know!\nThanks,\nRandy\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\nRandall Stieghorst\nAdvisor",

I see that tittle is \u201cManaging Bias in Compensation & Recognition\" vs \u201cRewards & Recognition\u201d. The latter came up during our last call. Recognition=Praises, email, public announcements but Rewards= Tangible perks in addition to salary. When discuss goals, objectives and outcomes expected we can confirm. \nI will say we should\u00a0 keep the title as Managing Bias in Rewards & Recogntion\" since internally we usually talk about Rewards & Recognition and not Compensation & Recognition but\u00a0 we will definitely discuss the\u00a0 specific content to be included.\n2.\n\u00a0\u00a0 \nWe spoke about Q1 to work on this ML.

In which languages? The 5 we did before?\nHow many total word? Do you estimate around 5000 like the ones we did before?\nAre there any PDF that will need translation?\nDo you have the English video you can share with me so I can quote English VO?\nWill you need other languages VO and subtitle?\nI would be able to confirm on translation timeline and VO/Subtitle timeline. But cannot guarantee on implementation (putting all localized content on the microlearning) since that, according to what I understand, would be in the hands of Arvinder.\n\u00a0\nPlease let me know and I would work on it ASAP.

Based on your suggestion, here\u2019s my recommendation:\nWe can create one module comprising four lessons, each with a duration of 8\u201310 minutes. This approach will ensure the content remains engaging and digestible while covering the full scope of Neurodiversity.\nI also wanted to confirm a few points to align with your expectations:\nWhen you mention a design document, are you referring to compiling the content along with draft designs in a PPT format? Could you please elaborate on this?\nThe content currently shared in the PPT seems insufficient for a 30\u201340-minute module. Would you like me to use the same content as is, or should I expand on it?\nLooking forward to your clarification to proceed accordingly.\nThanks,\nArvin\nFrom:\n Chuck Adams <c.adams@lcwmail.com>\nSent:\n Thursday, January 9, 2025 10:19 PM\nTo:\n Arvinder Kaur <a.kaur@lcwmail.com>\nSubject:\n RE: Religious Inclusion\n \n\u00a0\nYes.\nThese are the in-person Spotlights that that we want to transition to elearnings.

Based on your suggestion, here\u2019s my recommendation:\nWe can create one module comprising four lessons, each with a duration of 8\u201310 minutes. This approach will ensure the content remains engaging and digestible while covering the full scope of Neurodiversity.\nI also wanted to confirm a few points to align with your expectations:\nWhen you mention a design document, are you referring to compiling the content along with draft designs in a PPT format? Could you please elaborate on this?\nThe content currently shared in the PPT seems insufficient for a 30\u201340-minute module. Would you like me to use the same content as is, or should I expand on it?\nLooking forward to your clarification to proceed accordingly.\nThanks,\nArvin\nFrom:\n Chuck Adams <c.adams@lcwmail.com>\nSent:\n Thursday, January 9, 2025 10:19 PM\nTo:\n Arvinder Kaur <a.kaur@lcwmail.com>\nSubject:\n RE: Religious Inclusion\n \n\u00a0\nYes.\nThese are the in-person Spotlights that that we want to transition to elearnings.

    "body": "Hi everyone! As promised, here is what you need to know about our bill pay process change. We will stop using Bill.com at the end of January, and are switching to QuickBooks Bill Pay (an Intuit brand). This is cheaper for the company, and offers better integration for my work. (Payroll for full-timers is not changing \u2013 this affects contractor and vendor payments only.)\n\u00a0\nPart-time and external consultants:\nYou should have already gotten an email from me and from Intuit to set up your free QuickBooks Money account so you can keep getting ACH payments. I can also input information manually if necessary.\nPlease be sure you are sending your time sheets/invoices to your approver (Chuck or Nicole) ONLY. They will then send it to me for processing (this prevents confusion and duplicates).\nIf you have any questions about your pay, please email Accounting or ping me in Teams.\n\u00a0\nSalaried folks who have expenses and get reimbursements: \nPlease continue sending your expense reports to Accounting ONLY as normal. Any reimbursements will be added into your paychecks instead of handled separately.\n\u00a0\nIf you are an approver of vendor invoices: \nPlease send the PDF invoice to \nlcw+expenses@assist.intuit.com\n and copy Accounting. The Intuit address is a bot inside the accounting software, so I need to also have it in my regular email in case it skips important things! \nFor questions or reminders about bills, please only email Accounting.\nSince it takes a few days minimum to set folks up in the new system, please be sure to send vendor invoices in a timely manner. \nDomestic vendors will get an email from me and Intuit after I get their first bill in the new system to set up their ACH payment account. \nVendors currently getting international wires, I will email to discuss options. Vendors on PayPal will not have any changes.\n\u00a0\nAny questions or problems, please let me know!\n\u00a0\n\u201cSG\u201d Gluckstein\n \n(they/them)\nAccountant\nLCW\nEmail: \naccounting@lcwmail.com\nPS: LCW will be closed December 24 through January 1.

The Inbox will have the materials for you to work on. You\u2019ll find a few files in there already. When finished you can put your output in the Outbox folder.\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\nLet\u2019s start with the Religious Inclusion micro-learning. I would like you to develop and share a design document for how you would build this as a 10-15 minute microlearning in Rise. Once we get past that one we can focus on the elearning transitions.\n\u00a0\nThe classroom deck to elearning transitions will be competed as 30-35 minute modules in Storyline. It is okay to put additional information on a \u2018Want to know More\u2019 branch but the main branch should be 30-35 minutes. I will need design documents for each of the sessions to show the SME for review before we start programming.\n\u00a0\nThe order of the transition will be:\nNeurodiversity\nBlack Community\nWomen in Leadership\nGenerations\nPeople with Disability \n\u00a0\nI figure this will take a few weeks for design, review, development, testing. It will be a good place to start. Let me know if you have any questions.\n\u00a0\nBest,\n\u00a0\nChuck\n\u00a0\nPlease Note:\u00a0Honoring the need for work/life balance, LCW will be closed for Winter Break from\u00a0December 24 through January 1st.
