Hope you are also fine.\nBelow are the responses to your questions.\n1.What courses have you been asked to deliver?\nResponse:\nI have been asked for micro learning and spotlight courses (first draft done by me and waiting for Andrea and Chuck feedbacks)\nFor spotlight , I have done for Neuro diversity and Randall is working with me.\na) Do these courses have deadlines for completion?\nResponse:\nNot sure, but I do need to know the timeline.\nb) Are any courses priority over others?\nResponse:\nPriority is microlearning and spotlights\n2. How long does it take you, on average, to turn an existing LCW training (from PPT) into an elearning or microloearning?\nResponse:\neLearning takes more time compare to microlearning.\n3.Are you using Rise or Storyline?\nResponse:\nI use Rise for microlearning and Storyline for eLearning courses.\n4. How long would it take you, on average, to create a new microlearning from scratch (assuming the course is around 30 minutes or less)?\nFor an average microlearning course will take 25-30 hours 30 mins courses. It can be less as well, if I provided with images.\nYou can assume someone from LCW would work with you on the content, as a subject matter expert\n5.Does Rise and/or Storyline allow for translation into other languages?\nIf Yes, is this something you can do? (We would have professional translators review for accuracy)\nIf No, do you know of a workaround (ex: translating outside of Rise/Storyline & then importing the translation)\nResponse\nIt is possible in both, just I need translation document and voiceover.it takes 50-60% time with comparing to original time taken for English language. But it is not too tough. I can do easily\nPlease let me know if you need anything\u00a0else\nThanks,\nArvin\nFrom:\n Nicole Barile <n.barile@lcwmail.com>\nSent:\n Thursday, February 13, 2025 11:07 PM\nTo:\n Arvinder Kaur <a.kaur@lcwmail.com>\nSubject:\n Questions about building new Microlearnings\n \n\u00a0\nHello Arvin,\nI hope you're having a great week!\nI know you have shared much of this information with Chuck already, but if you can answer the following questions, it would\u00a0be greatly appreciated.\nWhat courses have you been asked to deliver?\nDo these courses have deadlines for completion?\nAre any courses priority over others?\nHow long does it take you, on average, to turn an existing LCW training (from PPT) into an elearning or microloearning?\nAre you using Rise or Storyline?\nHow long would it take you, on average, to create a new microlearning from scratch (assuming the course is around 30 minutes or less)?\nYou can assume someone from LCW would work with you on the content, as a subject matter expert\nDoes Rise and/or Storyline allow for translation into other languages?\nIf Yes, is this something you can do?

How long does it take you, on average, to turn an existing LCW training (from PPT) into an elearning or microloearning?\nResponse:\neLearning takes more time compare to microlearning.\n3.Are you using Rise or Storyline?\nResponse:\nI use Rise for microlearning and Storyline for eLearning courses.\n4. How long would it take you, on average, to create a new microlearning from scratch (assuming the course is around 30 minutes or less)?\nFor an average microlearning course will take 25-30 hours 30 mins courses.

Any tweaks you might have, at this stage, would also be welcome. Unlike a video, luckily, changing the narration at any point is really easy, as it doesn\u2019t modify the timing of animations or anything.\n\u00a0\nHey Arvinder,\nAs Rebecca reviews this, feel free to get started on building out the first version of the course (it\u2019s also saved in your inbox folder, of course). Changes to narration should not have a huge impact.\u00a0 There are several places where an interactive learning activity is needed \u2013 I have not dictated what type they should be, so please design/develop your best ideas and we can connect after.\n\u00a0\nAny questions, please let me know!\nThanks,\nRandy\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\nRandall Stieghorst\nAdvisor",
