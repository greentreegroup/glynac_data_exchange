Please feel free to use what you feel is appropriate and discard what you don't.\nFirst,\u00a0\nyour Culture Amp results are fairly strong, so you should feel good about that. If we are able to work with you, we would want to look at it more closely and fully, such as see demographic breakdowns so we can do a proper and holistic analysis.\u00a0 Based on a very quick and initial view, you have some really positive results such as mission alignment and strong manager feedback which is a great foundation for any organization to start with.\u00a0 On the other end, you have some opportunities to work on decision making, perceptions of equity and talent development to ensure it's inclusive and transparent.\u00a0\u00a0\nThe good news is that your SLT presentation does point to these but I would recommend the following to consider:\non slide 3, consider editing or adding objectives that speak to talent advancement and retention in addition to recruitment and onboarding. The talent war is escalating and your investment in current staff should be protected, especially if you want to increase diversity at higher levels.\u00a0\u00a0\nconsider adding in some high level findings from your culture amp survey to support slide 3 statements.\u00a0 SLT and board members typically respond to data, particularly when it comes from your employees and can create the sense of urgency to build your case.\u00a0 eg.:\n\u00a048% (less than half) see themselves working at Genesys in 2 yrs\n44% feel genesys ensures performance standards are consistently applied\n45% feel they have access to learning and development to do job well\nwhile 74% feel they have the opportunity to apply, 65% feel they have equal opportunity to succeed and 45% believe they have good career opportunities\nNOTE:\u00a0 if this is going in front of the board, the SLT may not want negative data displayed but perhaps if you balance with the positive?\nslide 4 under \"potential initiatives include\".\u00a0 In my experience when you add these options, leaders tend to be attracted to terms and ideas they may be familiar with. My concern would be that they may focus on items that may be off target from your true targets and priorities.\u00a0\u00a0 \nAnother way to position your efforts would be to say something like \"potential initiatives will be aligned to: (a) key findings from our employee feedback (b) our existing challenges (c) business growth goals to represent a diversified community etc.\u00a0 \u00a0\nThen, you can talk to examples if you would like.\nslide 5.\u00a0 I would recommend explicitly calling out executive leadership role in your efforts. Leadership ownership and accountability will be critical to adding credibility, visibility to your pillars efforts.\u00a0 If you have an ask at this point, clearly identify what is your ask of your SLT.\u00a0 If not, you can talk to fact that the council will need support of SLT, as a first ask.\nWe hope this is helpful to you.\u00a0 Please let me know if you have any questions as you reflect on the above!\u00a0\u00a0\nHave a great weekend,\nDeb\nFrom:\n Jenny Wolfe-National <jwolfe@genesysworks.org>\nSent:\n Friday, July 14, 2023 2:24 PM\nTo:\n Sue Enright-Chicago <senright@genesysworks.org>; Conner Williams <c.williams@lcwmail.com>\nCc:\n Stephanie Latarewicz-National <slatarewicz@genesysworks.org>; Deb Munster <d.munster@lcwmail.com>; Alisa Kolodizner <a.kolodizner@lcwmail.com>\nSubject:\n RE: LCW Follow-Up\n \n\u00a0\nHi Conner, Deb, and Alisa,\n\u00a0\nThank you all so much for your time this week! We really, really appreciate it.\n\u00a0\nOur biggest takeaway from the call were to:\nSet a few key metrics based on what our biggest cliffs are\nEnsure we have an understanding of what framework we are driving toward\nInclude an audit as part of our efforts to help identify cliffs and opportunities\nLCW is open to acting as a resource as we start this work so that our request for official resources and budget moving forward are most likely to be approved by our SLT and Board. Our understanding was that you all would be open to doing this on a pro bono basis during this \u201cboard approval phase.\u201d If I misunderstood that, please let me know!\n\u00a0\nOn the last point, we\u2019ve attached (i) what we plan to share with the Senior Leadership Team on Tuesday and (ii) our 2022 Culture Amp survey results.

Today we\u2019re talking about how to raise a healthy eater, and how running late can help lower your risk for cancer. But before we get to that \u2026\nThis week\u2019s must-reads:\nDo you want to build meaningful connections? \nHere are \nfour ways\n.\nBlack widow spider bites really hurt! \nLearn more\n \nabout the iconic arachnid.\nADVERTISEMENT\n \n \n \n\u00a0\n4,000 steps to better health.\n A new study finds a sweet spot \nfor step counts.\nWhy some dementia patients make art. \nCreativity can increase even \nwhen the brain is failing.\nThe science of raising a healthy eater\nI grew up in a household of disordered eating, food battles and unhealthy meals. I wanted to do better for my own child.\nSo I turned to science. Researchers have spent a lot of time observing children\u2019s eating habits and learning how adult behaviors can influence them, for good or bad. It turns out that many of the well-meaning efforts we make as parents to encourage healthful eating can backfire.\nAfter talking with various researchers over the years and writing about what I learned, I acted on it. I filled my house with healthful food and let my child make decisions about what she wanted to eat. We didn\u2019t fight if she didn\u2019t clean her plate, and there were no rewards for eating vegetables (a common food mistake parents make). If she didn\u2019t want to try something, I tried to model good habits by tasting it and eating it enthusiastically. And I didn\u2019t make a big deal out of dessert. Sometimes it was fruit. Sometimes it was a trip to get ice cream.\nMy child is now an adult. She eats a varied and healthful diet and doesn\u2019t exhibit any of the disordered eating I learned from my mom. I\u2019m happy to have broken this cycle. And it\u2019s the reason I wanted to write this week about the science of raising a healthy eater as part of our special children\u2019s health report.\n \n(Carlos Miranda for The Washington Post)\nTo raise a healthy eater, avoid these 6 common food mistakes\nGood eating habits can affect a child\u2019s health for a lifetime.

But they debate whether it\u2019s good medicine to extract them preemptively when such issues don't exist.\nBy Marlene Cimons\nRead more\n \n\u00a0\n \n(Abbey Lossing for The Washington Post)\nPick up the pace!\nThere\u2019s some great news this week about how moving just a little faster can lower your risk for cancer.\nWe\u2019re not talking about formal exercise. This study focused on people who hurried up the stairs, ran to catch a bus or hustled across a mall parking lot. The researchers used activity-tracker data for more than 22,000 men and women, and found that those who moved fast for at least three minutes a day were about 30 percent less likely to die of many types of cancer than people who almost always strolled gently from place to place. And the effect was seen even if none of them otherwise exercised.\nTo learn more, read the full report from Your Move columnist Gretchen Reynolds.\n \n(Getty Images)\nWhy moving fast 3 minutes a day can lower your cancer risk\nPeople who regularly rushed up stairs or hurried to catch a bus were about 30 percent less likely to die of many types of cancer than people who dawdled.\nBy Gretchen Reynolds\nRead more\n \n\u00a0\nShould you let your dog lick your face?\nThis week, a reader asks about whether she should allow her dog to lick her face.\nI\u2019m a lifelong dog owner, and I learned a few things.

So if you typically hit the hay around 10 p.m., you\u2019ll want to plan your last cup of coffee between 2 p.m. to 4 p.m.\n\u00a0\nThis is because \u201cit can take six to eight hours for your body to process and eliminate the caffeine you consume in one sitting,\u201d Kristine Dilley, lead outpatient dietitian in nutrition services at the Ohio State University Wexner Medical Center, previously told \nFortune\n.\n\u00a0\n\u201cA good rule of thumb is to avoid caffeine after lunchtime,\u201d says Terry Cralle, registered nurse and representative of the Better Sleep Council. \u201cConsuming caffeine six hours before bedtime can reduce total sleep time by one hour.\u201d\n\u00a0\nWhy caffeine keeps you awake\n\u00a0\nCaffeine is a stimulant that can help increase alertness and give you more energy. It takes anywhere from 15 to 45 minutes for caffeine to kick in; however, it takes much longer to leave your system. The half-life for caffeine is roughly four to six hours, which means half of the dosage of caffeine is still in your system four to six hours after consumption.\n\u00a0\nHowever, some people become more sensitive to caffeine as they get older and may need more than eight hours to process caffeine, according to Dr. Marie-Pierre St-Onge, an associate professor of nutritional medicine at Columbia University Irving Medical Center.\n\u00a0 \nHow do you know if you\u2019ve had too much caffeine?\u00a0\n\u00a0\nFor most people, it\u2019s safe to consume 400 milligrams of caffeine per day. To put that in perspective, an eight-ounce cup of coffee has about 95\u2013200 milligrams of caffeine, and a 12-ounce of soda has about 35\u201345 milligrams. But caffeine impacts everyone differently.\n\u00a0\nSome signs of overconsumption of caffeine include:\nRestlessness\u00a0\nJitters\nInsomnia\nUpset stomach\nFast heart rate\nDizziness\nAnxiety\nDehydration\nDependency\u00a0\n\u00a0\nWhat to do instead of drinking caffeine\u00a0\nIf you\u2019re looking to cut back on caffeine, these tips to can get through your midday slump:\nHave a protein-rich breakfast\n \nDrink lemon water, decaffeinated herbal tea, or a smoothie\nTake a \n30-minute power nap\nTake a walk outside\nTake a \ncold shower\n\u00a0\nRead L\u2019Oreal Thompson Payton\u2019s full article \nhere\n.\n\u200a\nTry this 1-minute stretch for neck pain\nIf you\u2019ve been sitting on an airplane or woken up on the wrong side of your bed, this simple stretch will help relieve tension in your neck.\n\u200a\n\u200a\n\u200a\n \n \n \n \n\u200a\n\u00a0CONTENT FROM CVS HEALTH\u00a0\n\u00a0\nSharing personal stories of being an unpaid caregiver\n\u00a0\nIn the last year, more than 48 million people in the U.S. provided unpaid care to a family member, friend or loved one \u2014 impacting their health but also strengthening an important bond.
