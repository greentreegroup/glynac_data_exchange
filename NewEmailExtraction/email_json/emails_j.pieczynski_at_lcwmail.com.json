We cannot truly stand with Indigenous Peoples without also acknowledging the struggles brought on by centuries of discrimination. According to the United Nations: \u27a1\ufe0f While Indigenous People make up less than 5% of the world\u2019s population, they represent 15% of the poorest. \u27a1\ufe0f Indigenous People are 3x as likely as non-Indigenous people to live in extreme poverty. Today and throughout the year, inclusive leaders must listen to and uplift the incredibly diverse lived experiences of Indigenous People on our journey toward equity, reconciliation, and authentic allyship. #DEI #Inclusion #Culture \nView\none person liked your LinkedIn post.\n\u00a0\n\ud83d\udc9c Since 2014, August 7th has been observed as Purple Heart Day in the United States\u2014a day to remember and honor the brave Americans who were either wounded on the battlefield or paid the ultimate sacrifice with their lives. \ud83d\udc9c Today, Veterans make up 6.4% of the United States\u2019 adult population at approximately 16.5 million people, and 30% are living with a disability. \ud83d\udc9c Our Veteran population exemplifies diversity, having sacrificed and served our country regardless of gender, race, ethnicity, religion, economic status, and the many other aspects of identity. \ud83d\udc9c It is crucial that inclusive leaders take the time to understand their lived experiences and continue to support Veterans on our journey toward building truly equitable mindsets and systems. #PurpleHeartDay #DEI #Culture \nView\n\u00a0\nGo to Inbox\n\u00a0\nUnder certain privacy laws and regulations, you must tell anyone who interacts with your connected social accounts that their data is being stored in HubSpot.

July 26 is now commemorated as #DisabilityIndependenceDay, and the month of July is recognized as #DisabilityPrideMonth. While disability rights have come a long way, there\u2019s still progress to be made in achieving truly equitable systems. According to a 2022 report from the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics: \u27a1\ufe0f Across all age groups, people with disabilities are much less likely to be employed than people without disabilities. \u27a1\ufe0f The unemployment rate for people with disabilities is about twice as high as the rate for people without disabilities. \u27a1\ufe0f 30% of workers with disabilities are employed part-time as opposed to 16% of nondisabled workers, often because their hours were reduced or they couldn\u2019t find an accessible full-time job. During July and throughout the year, we stand with the disabled community as we seek to foster equity in the communities where people live and at the organizations where they work. Only when all cultures are included can we ensure equitable outcomes and optimized performance in the workplace. #DEI #DiversityAndInclusion #Culture \nView\n2 people liked your LinkedIn post.\n\u00a0\nEvery LCW Learning Journey is grounded in four overarching competencies: \ud83d\udc49 Awareness and Knowledge \ud83d\udc49 Cultural Literacy \ud83d\udc49 Empathy & Collaboration \ud83d\udc49 Sustainable Inclusion LCW experts use Inclusive Leadership and Mitigating Bias learning journeys as a starting place to collaborate in developing a customized plan that achieves long-term, measurable results.

    "subject": "What's New at Zoom | July 2023 Recap",
    "body": "Dear Jacob,\u00a0\nWhether it's new products and features or courses that teach you to use Zoom better, we are constantly evolving to improve your experience. To help keep you up to date, we have summarized some key new things you should know below. \nDownload\n the latest version of the Zoom desktop client to access all these features and more.\u00a0\nFor more resources to help you stay up to date, check out:\u00a0\nPreview notes\n \u2013 A list of upcoming features. This page is only available to Zoom account owners and admins; you must sign in to view them.\nRelease notes\n \u2013 A complete list of past releases across the Zoom platform.\u00a0\nIf you have questions about the features and announcements outlined below, please reply directly to this email.\n*Note: Some products and features may not be available to all customers.\u00a0\nZoom Learning Center Updates \nDiscover updated Zoom Rooms courses - \nThe Zoom Learning Center team recently updated the \nZoom Rooms catalog\n\u00a0to include information on all the latest and greatest features and enhancements. Refresh your memory on Zoom Rooms features, or learn something new like how you can reserve a Zoom Room with Workspace Reservation! \nZoom Community\u00a0 \nThe \nCustomer Success Forum\n\u00a0on the Zoom Community is now live!\n Launched in 2021, the \nZoom Community\n\u00a0is a hub for users to find answers, seek support, and receive guidance from fellow Zoom users and Zoom product experts. In the new Customer Success Forum, users will find a collaborative place to share success stories, learn about upcoming events, and exchange helpful ways to use Zoom features, all in one centralized, easily accessible location. Join the forum and learn more today!\nKey Highlights from Zoom\u2019s July Releases\u00a0 \nZoom Web\n\u00a0Updates \nSet default Team Chat channels for users\n\u00a0-\n Account owners and admins can set up to 5 default Team Chat channels, to which all new and existing users will automatically be added. The chosen channels must be public channels and users can choose to leave these default channels. \nZoom Phone\n\u00a0Updates \nAdvanced encryption for voicemails -\n Once advanced encryption for Zoom Phone voicemail is enabled, voicemail messages are received and recorded by Zoom servers which encrypt them with keys only known to their intended recipients\u2019 devices. If admins enable the Escrow feature within advanced encryption for voicemails, admins will now be able to access these keys and users voicemails. Shared Line Appearance, Shared Line Group, Call Queue, or Auto Receptionist voicemail are not supported. Additionally, functionalities like email to voicemail, transcriptions, and the ability to check voicemails through dialing or the web are disabled when this feature is enabled. To utilize this feature, users must have a Power Pack license. Only admins with appropriate permissions can manage these voicemails.\nZoom Events\n\u00a0Updates \nAttendee Companion app for Zoom - \nAttendees can join hybrid events using the companion app. This app allows them to attend an event in person or virtually without leaving Zoom Events. They can find, bookmark, and attend sessions in hybrid events. Attendees can navigate the physical space using maps and digital guides and switch between in-person and virtual webinar/meeting streams. During hybrid events, attendees can connect with in-person and virtual attendees. The companion app is available for iOS and Android devices. This feature may not be immediately available, as it is dependent on a backend server update. \nSecurity questions authentication for registration\n\u00a0-\n Hosts can enable security questions for registrants when creating an event. Security questions apply to all registrants regardless of how they join (i.e., sign in to Zoom/IDP or fast join). The host can choose questions from a list of security questions (a template of 10 questions) and can customize up to 3 security questions. The questions will appear on the registration page as a mandatory item. Registrants must pick at least one question from the list and answer it to complete registration. The answer to each question will be associated with unique users, and the answer will be stored safely on the Zoom Events platform. After authentication at joining, registrants must answer the question they chose at registration. Only the registrant has the answer to the security question. If the registrant loses the answer, they will also lose access to the assigned ticket and cannot join the event. Registrants can contact the host for help and can register another ticket from the event detail page.\nZoom IQ for Sales\n\u00a0Updates \nEmail compose with Zoom IQ for Sales\n\u00a0-\n Account owners and admins can enable or disable users' option to use Zoom IQ to create follow-up emails directly from the Zoom IQ for Sales Deals page. This setting is available at the account level and is disabled by default. This feature is currently not available for users with External IQ Admin and Zoom IQ Collaborator roles. \nZoom Contact Center\n\u00a0Updates \nSupport for regions -\n Account owners and admins can create regions to organize users based on their location and apply voice routing settings specific to each location. This feature must be enabled by Zoom. \nAuto answer with queue default greeting - \nAccount owners and admins can improve the call handling efficiency by implementing the auto answer feature for voice engagements. With auto answer, agents can automatically connect with callers, reducing the number of clicks required and providing a standardized caller experience. It also eliminates the need for agents to repeat the same greeting on every engagement, ensuring consistent greetings. \nVideo channel for integrations -\n The Zendesk and Salesforce integrations for Zoom Contact Center support the video channel. As a result, agents can receive incoming video engagements, make outbound video calls, upgrade a voice call to video call, and chat with the consumer using in-video chat during the video engagement within the integration. During an incoming/outbound video engagement, the agent can see the customer screen pop within the CRM based on the 'email address' match. Configuration settings have been updated with video channel settings for Screen pop and search settings.\u00a0 \nWorkspace Reservation\n\u00a0Updates \nWorkspaces admin management of reservations - \nAdmins can add, change, or delete reservations at the building level. They can also override users' reservations in the building. Admins can book a workspace for a user (without needing to set up delegation), change a current workspace reservation of a user, and delete a user's current reservation. The user will receive a\u00a0 notification if a change was made to the reservation by an admin. \nConfigure a permanent desk -\n Account owners and admins can assign a user a permanent desk. Permanent desks are not reservable and will always display the assigned user at that desk. This feature displays users, who come into the office every day, and their permanent desks on the floor map. \nBusiness Announcements \nZoom Software Lifecycle Policy -\n We plan to enforce the fourth round of our Software Lifecycle Policy on August 5, 2023, for all products and services, starting with the minimum versions referenced in the table found \nhere\n. Users running an end-of-life version after August 5 will not be able to join meetings via the Zoom Client and will be prompted to update or join from the Web browser. As always, we highly recommend you regularly download and update to the latest version of Zoom software by checking for updates within the Zoom desktop client or by navigating to \nzoom.us/download\n to take advantage of all our latest security and functionality features. Note: The end-of-life enforcement for Zoom Room Controllers on Windows UWP has been extended to August 5, 2023.\u00a0 \nEnd of Life for JSON Web Token (JWT) App Type in Zoom Marketplace -\n As a reminder, Zoom disabled the ability to create new JWT apps on June 1, 2023. Developers have until September 1, 2023 to migrate their JWT-based solutions to the new Server-to-Server OAuth or OAuth app types. For more information, please see the \nJWT migration guide\n\u00a0and \nJWT deprecation FAQ\n. \nHappy Zooming,\nZoom Success Advisor\nClick \nhere\n to unsubscribe from this list or manage your preferences \nhere\n.",

    "body": "Content marketing has been the central pillar of marketing for years, but it no longer works the way most understand it.\n \n \nHi Jacob!\n\u00a0\nI talk with a lot of marketers. What do the smartest marketers understand that the rest don't? They understand that content marketing as we\u2019ve known it no longer works.\n\u00a0\nContent marketing has been the central pillar of marketing online for the last 10+ years. Write a blog post, optimize it for search, promote it everywhere, and watch the platforms send you traffic.\n\u00a0\nThat recipe no longer works, and it hasn\u2019t for some time. Organic traffic is down, ad costs are up, email is failing.\u00a0 And yet so many marketers keep going back to this playbook like it\u2019s 2010.\n\u00a0\nThe reason content marketing as we\u2019ve known it no longer works has to do with the platforms \u2014 I\u2019m talking about Google, Facebook, Linkedin, Twitter, Reddit, TikTok, etc.\n\u00a0\nBeginning some years back, the platforms shifted from driving traffic to our websites (or being benign about it) to actively focusing on keeping it for themselves, on their platforms.\u00a0\n\u00a0\nThis is the natural cycle of all platforms: Early in life they start out open and flexible (benign), but as they gain size and maturity, they start building walls to protect and sustain their value.\n\u00a0\nSo what do the smartest marketers know? And how have they adjusted?\n\u00a0\nFirstly, they know that the platforms aren\u2019t fully walled off; they\u2019ve just restricted the exits more than they have in the past.\n\u00a0\nThe platforms don\u2019t like users leaving, plain and simple. They want us to stay on their platform and they\u2019ll do everything in their power to make that happen.\n\u00a0\nSo if you can\u2019t get the platforms to drive you traffic, how do you get the attention of the people you want to be talking with?\n\u00a0\nThrough engagement and distribution. This is the new paradigm.\u00a0\u00a0\n\u00a0\nENGAGEMENT: POSTING CONTENT THAT LIVES ON THE PLATFORM\n\u00a0\nForget about blog posts on your site (they\u2019re still relevant, but in a different way). The key to driving engagement is posting content that people want to consume ON the platforms.\n\u00a0\nI\u2019ve heard this referred to as zero-click marketing, which I like; however, I don\u2019t think it\u2019s a term many are familiar with yet. But it gets the concept across.\n\u00a0\nWhat content can be consumed on a platform? A video, an image/collection of photos, a written post, a survey, an audiogram, etc.\n\u00a0\nNot only is on-platform content easier for a person to consume (you don\u2019t need to leave Linkedin to read this post), but the platform also prioritizes these types of posts.\n\u00a0\nSaid differently, content that keeps users on a platform gets exposed to more members of that platform than content that would send those people away from the platform.\n\u00a0\nThat\u2019s literally how platform algorithms are designed: reward stuff that keeps people on the platform, and discount stuff that leads people away.\u00a0\u00a0\n\u00a0\nWhich brings us to the second component of this new paradigm: how to reach the maximum number of people on these platforms, which is all about distribution.\n\u00a0\nDISTRIBUTION: ACHIEVING MAX EXPOSURE OF YOUR CONTENT\n\u00a0\nAssuming you post content that meets the above criteria (something that can be consumed on a platform), how do you get it exposed to the MOST people?\n\u00a0\nIn my experience, distribution is something that marketers aren\u2019t very good at. They focus a great deal on the content and on production, but distribution gets short shrift.\n\u00a0\nThat\u2019s a giant mistake.\n\u00a0\nDistribution is how you derive value from the content you create, and, in this new paradigm you need new ways to reach people because the platforms aren\u2019t going to send them your way.\n\u00a0\nYes, you could publish this content to your brand page, but no one is going to see it unless you pay to promote it.\u00a0\n\u00a0\nYou could run some ads to promote your posts, but again, we\u2019re back to spending money, and ads are fundamentally unsustainable, especially in B2B.\n\u00a0\nThe KEY to distribution is getting people to share it to their networks, and the people you have ready access to are your employees: your CEO, the interns, and everyone in between.\n\u00a0\nYou already understand why the type of content is important: It\u2019s got to be something that 1) the platform prioritizes and 2) that users want to engage with. Check.\n\u00a0\nWell, WHO posts the content also matters. The #1 thing platforms want are users and the #1 type of user a network wants is a user who contributes CONTENT to their platform.\u00a0\u00a0\n\u00a0\nThese content-contributing users are the users who keep all of the other users coming back and they\u2019re SUPER rare \u2014 there\u2019s only one for every 100 average users.\u00a0\u00a0\n\u00a0\nCase in point: You wouldn\u2019t be here if I and X number of other people didn\u2019t post to this platform! I\u2019m not saying this is the world's best post. It\u2019s not, but you get the point.\n\u00a0\nEmployees are users in the eyes of a platform, which means the content they post \u2014 assuming it meets the above criteria \u2014 will be distributed to the broadest possible audience.\n\u00a0\nAnd, of course, the more of your people you get to distribute your content, the greater the number of people it will be exposed to. But marketing has always been a numbers game.\n\u00a0\nSo yes, content marketing as we\u2019ve known it is dead, but the simpler reality is that the rules have just changed.\n\u00a0\nBut when the rules change, when people are caught off guard, when they don\u2019t even see the ground shifting underneath them, THAT\u2019S when the opportunity is the greatest.\u00a0\u00a0\n\u00a0\nAnd this is what the smartest marketers know: They\u2019re sourcing content to drive engagement and leveraging their people to distribute it.\n\u00a0\nThanks for reading, and I hope you have a wonderful weekend!\n\u00a0\nBest,\n\u00a0\nCameron Brain\u00a0\nCEO & Co-Founder\nEveryoneSocial\n\u00a0\nP.S. - Feel free to connect with me on \nLinkedIn\n or \nTwitter\n!\nMake sure to follow us on social media!\n \n \n \n \nEveryoneSocial, 215 W Sego Lily Dr., #708100, Sandy, Utah 84070, United States \nUnsubscribe\n \nManage preferences",

TOMORROW\u2019S INSIGHTS.\nA daily newsletter from McKinsey & Company\nBrought to you by \nLiz Hilton Segel\n, chief client officer and managing partner, global industry practices, &\u00a0\nHomayoun Hatami\n, managing partner, global client capabilities\nBooks for summer reading\nIn the news\n\u2022\nTake it easy.\n Although humans often dream of a life of leisure, it\u2019s been the norm to work 40 hours a week since the 1990s. With the acceleration of AI, people increasingly speculate about whether machines will totally replace human labor\u2014but could society actually handle that? Present-day workers seem uncomfortable with relaxing, using leisure time to pursue goals. That hasn\u2019t always been the case. In 17th-century England, knitters routinely skipped work to go to \u201cthe alehouse or nine-pins,\u201d a Royal Society fellow complained. Perhaps a more leisurely life of rest is needed. [\nFT\n]\n\u2022\nLow levels of reading.\n Nearly a third of American students spend very little or no time reading for pleasure, and the average 13-year-old\u2019s reading scores have fallen to their lowest level in about two decades, according to a recent National Assessment of Educational Progress report. Experts point to technology and social media as among the largest factors that may be contributing to a lack of reading. The average age that a child gets their first mobile phone is now 11, a 2022 Stanford Medicine study revealed. That\u2019s an age where reading is normally encouraged. [\nThe Hill\n]\nPerhaps as a sign of much-needed respite, the most popular genre this year was fiction and poetry.\nOn McKinsey.com\n\u2022\nWhat to read.\n Our world is both concerning\u2014with executives navigating geopolitical tensions, economic setbacks, and other challenges\u2014and exciting, with the advent of generative AI, which promises to shift the way we work. Our annual summer reading list reflects today\u2019s evolving times, with selections by leaders from around the world, including picks from McKinsey global managing partner \nBob Sternfels\n, chief marketing officer \nTracy Francis\n, managing partner of global client capabilities \nHomayoun Hatami\n, and senior partner \nRodney Zemmel\n. We also provide 11 additional curated reading lists\n.\n\u2022\nSomething for everyone.\n Out of more than 70 selections, the top two books CEOs, founders, and editors recommended for \nMcKinsey\u2019s 2023 summer reading guide\n were \nThe Age of AI: And Our Human Future\n\u2014by Daniel Huttenlocher, Henry A. Kissinger, and Eric Schmidt\u2014and \nTrust\n by Hernan Diaz. These are from our innovation and fiction and poetry genres, respectively. In addition to these genres, with this year\u2019s list, you\u2019ll find books across genres such as workplace culture, history, personal development, biography and memoir, and more\n.\nEnjoy our annual book list\n\u2014 Edited by Vanessa Burke, editor, Atlanta\nWas this forwarded to you? \nSign up here\n.\nOr \nsend us feedback\n\u2014we\u2019d love to hear from you.\nFollow our thinking\n \nThis email contains information about McKinsey's research, insights, services, or events.

TOMORROW\u2019S INSIGHTS.\nA daily newsletter from McKinsey & Company\nBrought to you by \nLiz Hilton Segel\n, chief client officer and managing partner, global industry practices, &\u00a0\nHomayoun Hatami\n, managing partner, global client capabilities\nSearing heat in India\nIn the news\n\u2022\nA deadly threat.\n Rising temperatures significantly threaten the physical and economic health of women and girls around the world. As a result of extreme heat, by 2050, more than 200,000 women in India, Nigeria, and the United States could die each year, new research by the Atlantic Council finds. Excessive heat restricts women\u2019s working hours, resulting in a loss of income. The poorest women\u2014such as West Bengal bricklayers who work outdoors and perform arduous physical labor\u2014are often the most affected. [\nAtlantic Council\n]\n\u2022\nLacking air-conditioning.\n As record-high temperatures are being recorded across the globe, women are disproportionately exposed to health and financial risks. Extreme heat in India, Nigeria, and the United States limits women\u2019s capacity for paid labor, amounting to $120 billion in lost productivity each year. Women who perform domestic chores, including collecting water for cleaning and cooking, are especially vulnerable to scorching temperatures. Just 9% of women\u2019s working hours in India occur in air-conditioned workplaces. [\nScientific American\n]\nWe estimate that 160 million to 200 million people could be living in urban areas in India with a nonzero annual probability of experiencing a lethal heatwave as soon as 2030.\nOn McKinsey.com\n\u2022\nClimate risk challenges.\n As India faces a rapidly changing physical environment, extreme heat and humidity could put millions of lives and billions of dollars at risk. In fact, India could become one of the world\u2019s first places to experience heat waves that exceed what a healthy human resting in the shade could survive, McKinsey Global Institute director \nJonathan Woetzel\n and coauthors explain. Rising heat and humidity levels will also affect labor productivity and economic growth in an economy that relies substantially on outdoor work\n.\n\u2022\nWhat extreme heat costs.\n Chronic exposure to extreme heat rapidly decreases people\u2019s ability to perform outdoor work. In India, the number of daylight hours during which outdoor work is unsafe will increase approximately 15% by 2030, compared with today\u2019s levels, McKinsey analysis reveals. Lost labor hours due to increasing heat and humidity levels could put roughly 2.5 to 4.5% of GDP at risk by 2030, equivalent to roughly $150 billion to $250 billion. See what it would take \nfor India to address the risk of lethal heat waves\n.\nUnderstand climate risk in India\n\u2014 Edited by Belinda Yu, editor, Atlanta\nWas this forwarded to you? \nSign up here\n.\nOr \nsend us feedback\n\u2014we\u2019d love to hear from you.\nFollow our thinking\n \nThis email contains information about McKinsey's research, insights, services, or events.

TOMORROW\u2019S INSIGHTS.\nA daily newsletter from McKinsey & Company\nBrought to you by \nLiz Hilton Segel\n, chief client officer and managing partner, global industry practices, &\u00a0\nHomayoun Hatami\n, managing partner, global client capabilities\nPlaying it (psychologically) safe\nIn the news\n\u2022\nToo much of a good thing.\n The Great Resignation of the pandemic years\u2014government data shows roughly 98 million people left their jobs in 2021 and 2022\u2014shone a light on toxic work cultures. But an insincere brand of niceness doesn\u2019t actually fix toxicity, which is generally defined as environments that are not inclusive. According to psychology professor and author Tessa West, too much niceness doesn\u2019t equate to empathy and can prevent managers from giving the critical feedback that helps people grow. [\nFortune\n]\n\u2022\nUnder pressure.\n One organization estimates that anxiety and depression cost 12 billion working days, to the tune of $1 trillion in lost productivity across the globe each year. Organizations have committed everything from apps, free therapy, and assistance hotlines to help employees, but many workers are still stressed by their jobs. If the problem exists at an organization-wide level, then training programs will do little to help, one CEO says. Even if these initiatives survive postpandemic, they might not be accompanied by strategies to address unmanageable workloads, which may increase as persistent labor issues reduce staff. [\nFT\n]\nAccording to one McKinsey survey, an overwhelming 89% of employee respondents said they believe that psychological safety in the workplace is essential.\nOn McKinsey.com\n\u2022\nThe power of psychological safety.\n Social scientists consider psychological safety\u2014feeling free to openly disagree and bring up concerns without fear of retaliation\u2014a basic need that\u2019s vital to personal well-being. Research reveals that psychological safety at work strongly predicts team performance, productivity, and quality\u2014and is even connected with better overall health. Open lines of feedback and communication can cultivate more creativity and inclusivity. According to a survey led by McKinsey senior partner \nAaron De Smet\n and colleagues, leaders can promote this environment by engaging in supportive, collaborative behaviors such as open-dialogue skills.\n\u2022\nDeveloping inclusive leaders.\n Creating psychological safety in the workplace requires an investment in developing empathetic and compassionate leaders. Organizations can formalize a commitment to psychological safety by reducing the stigma around mental health, offering leadership training that goes beyond a one-off presentation, and incorporating skill development into leaders\u2019 daily work.

TOMORROW\u2019S INSIGHTS.\nA daily newsletter from McKinsey & Company\nBrought to you by \nLiz Hilton Segel\n, chief client officer and managing partner, global industry practices, &\u00a0\nHomayoun Hatami\n, managing partner, global client capabilities\nThe rise of generative AI\nIn the news\n\u2022\nCustom credit cards.\n Although generative-AI tools have clearly captured the world's attention, finance leaders have been using computers to automate banking for decades, starting with ATMs in the 1970s. Still, generative AI represents a breakthrough in the development of artificial intelligence. Generative AI\u2019s ability to use training data to create new content could give financial institutions the capacity to personalize products for every consumer. Banks might, for example, offer credit cards with financial perks that factor in how frequently someone orders takeout or travels for work. [\nFortune\n]\n\u2022\nThe AI-enabled accountant.\n Companies\u2019 finance and accounting departments are filled with routine activities. Now, CFOs are exploring the potential of generative AI to automate tasks even as organizations are trimming costs and dealing with a shortage of accountants. By producing lengthy reports and presentations, generative AI could remove much of the typical work for auditors and accountants. That might allow finance professionals to play a greater role in decision making, which in turn may spark more interest in these careers. [\nWSJ\n]\nAbout 75% of the value that generative-AI use cases could deliver falls across customer operations, marketing and sales, software engineering, and R&D.\nOn McKinsey.com\n\u2022\nProductivity boost.\n As companies rush to adapt and implement generative AI, understanding its potential to deliver value to the economy and society will help shape critical decisions about the technology. Generative AI\u2019s impact on productivity could add trillions of dollars in value to the global economy. Our latest research estimates that generative AI may add the equivalent of $2.6 trillion to $4.4 trillion annually across 63 use cases, McKinsey senior partner \nLareina Yee\n and coauthors explain.\n\u2022\nTransforming knowledge work. \nGenerative AI is likely to have the biggest effect on knowledge work, particularly activities involving decision making and collaboration. The capacity to automate activities that require applying expertise has increased to 58.5% in 2023, from 24.5% in 2017, while the ability to automate managing and developing talent jumped to 49.0% in 2023, from 15.5% in 2017, McKinsey estimates show. \nConsider how leaders may use generative AI to potentially create value\n, streamline processes, and augment employee performance.\n\ufeffSee what generative AI could do\n\u2014 Edited by Belinda Yu, editor, Atlanta\nWas this forwarded to you? \nSign up here\n.\nOr \nsend us feedback\n\u2014we\u2019d love to hear from you.\nFollow our thinking\n \nThis email contains information about McKinsey's research, insights, services, or events.

TOMORROW\u2019S INSIGHTS.\nA daily newsletter from McKinsey & Company\n \nBrought to you by \nLiz Hilton Segel\n, chief client officer and managing partner, global industry practices, &\u00a0\nHomayoun Hatami\n, managing partner, global client capabilities\nStepping down smoothly as a CEO\nIn the news\n\u2022\nRecord turnover.\n It\u2019s been a rough year for US businesses, with leaders contending with elevated inflation, the threat of recession, skills shortages, and disruptive technologies such as AI. In May 2023, monthly CEO turnover in the US reached an all-time high, with 224 chief executives departing their jobs, an executive outplacement company has found. That\u2019s a 52% increase from April 2023 and the biggest number of CEOs leaving in one month since 2002, when the company started collecting these data. [\nFortune\n]\n\u2022\nLeadership legitimacy.\n The role of CEO carries great authority. Yet newly appointed executives who rely solely on authority to lead can only partly inspire. Displaying competence is a deeper way to influence, but workers\u2019 support may rise or fall depending on a leader\u2019s performance. New CEOs who gain legitimacy, however, earn the perceived right to lead in the best and worst of times. By acting with integrity, particularly when that comes at a cost\u2014for instance, recalling a dangerous item immediately\u2014leaders earn the trust of employees. [\nHBR\n]\nA new CEO\u2019s early dismissal is 2.4 times more likely when the outgoing CEO remains the board chair.\nOn McKinsey.com\n\u2022\n\ufeffWhat bad transitions cost.\n When you\u2019re a celebrated CEO, it\u2019s hard to imagine being unprepared at the end of your career, McKinsey senior partner \nCarolyn Dewar\n and coauthors share. But as the transition to a new CEO gets closer, the reality that you\u2019ve never done this before can feel daunting. Unlike Olympic athletes who practice over and over, you\u2019ll only have one very public shot at it, and under emotional strain. Poorly managed C-suite transitions wipe out close to $1 trillion in market value every year in S&P 1500 companies\n.\n\u2022\nBetter CEO handoffs.\n In a successful relay, the person receiving the baton starts running well before the baton reaches them. The best chief executives work with their directors on succession planning throughout their tenure. For instance, former Intuit CEO Brad Smith spoke to his board every quarter to update them on his succession plan. This helped to ensure there were no surprises when the time came to transition to a new CEO, Smith explains.

As you settle in and unwind, catch up on digital transformations in the age of AI, the future of the hospitality industry, creating new market solutions without disrupting existing industries, and more.\n \nAre you rewired to win? The latest \nFive Fifty\n from \nMcKinsey Quarterly\n shows why digital transformations are more important than ever in the age of generative AI.\nUnlock the power of AI\n \nWhat will staying at a hotel be like in 2030? See how the hospitality industry will evolve to benefit travelers, workers, and the environment in McKinsey\u2019s \nThe Next Normal\n series.\nCheck into the hotel of the future\n \nIn a new \nAuthor Talks\n interview, professor Ren\u00e9e Mauborgne talks to McKinsey\u2019s Elissa Bandler about how companies can innovate without disrupting industries or displacing jobs.\nPush the boundaries\n \nOur weekly briefing note on sustainable and inclusive growth explores how technological advancements in bioengineering and shared-mobility solutions are helping to solve global challenges.\nGet updated\nTECH FOR EXECS\n \nThe rise and rise of Python\nWelcome to Tech for Execs: quick primers on technology concepts to get business leaders up to speed.\nWhy do people choose Python?\n \nIt\u2019s a go-to language\n for back-end development, software, data science, and machine learning. It\u2019s easy to learn and integrates with other languages\u2014so it can find its place within pre-existing architectures without too much trouble.\nWhat are the biggest benefits?\n Python is great for creating automated processes, which save time. Its popularity means there are thousands of existing packages\u2014ready-to-use \u2018chunks\u2019 of code\u2014out there. And it\u2019s easy to read and debug, and therefore it\u2019s simple to fix if something does go wrong.\nHow are organizations using Python?\n It\u2019s \nparticularly popular for data science applications\n. At McKinsey, we used Python in our work with a healthcare organization to help \nimprove COVID-19 capacity modelling\n. Because when you\u2019re dealing with complex data lakes and working at speed, simplicity is a virtue.\nDo my developers know how to use Python?\n There\u2019s a good chance they do\u2014it\u2019s one of the more popular languages available. Even if they don\u2019t, experienced developers can usually pick the language up quickly.\nIf we start using Python, does that mean starting over?\n Not necessarily\u2014Python plays well with other languages. Plus, there\u2019s no shortage of packages and frameworks out there to accelerate your work. One example is \nKedro, McKinsey\u2019s open-source framework\n, which simplifies and standardizes data science coding.\nQUOTE OF THE DAY\n\u201cChildren need to have family time. They need to be able to talk with their parents, have hobbies, and eat dinner together. These types of things are so important, more important than a worksheet\u2014and that\u2019s coming from a former teacher.\u201d\n\u2014\nJamie Sears\n, founder and CEO of Not So Wimpy Teacher, on how we should be thinking differently about homework, in a \nrecent \nAuthor Talks\n interview\nchart of the day\n \nSee today\u2019s chart\nReady to unwind?\nWhat is space junk?\nSpace junk refers to fragments left behind in space. Consisting mostly of rocket-launching material and disused satellites, this debris can make space travel and exploration more challenging.\nFind out what\u2019s in orbit\n\u00a0\nData Points: Your weekly quiz\nHow well do you know the numbers behind the changes in business, society, and the world?

TOMORROW\u2019S INSIGHTS.\nA daily newsletter from McKinsey & Company\n \nBrought to you by \nLiz Hilton Segel\n, chief client officer and managing partner, global industry practices, &\u00a0\nHomayoun Hatami\n, managing partner, global client capabilities\nTransformational technologies\nIn the news\n\u2022\nPrivacy concerns.\n Employers are certain that generative-AI platforms could boost workers\u2019 productivity. What they are less sure of is whether the technology would expose confidential information to rivals or bad actors. Executives are therefore worried about both \u201cmissing out\u201d on and \u201cmessing up\u201d the generative-AI opportunity, says the head of one law firm\u2019s machine learning practice. In February 2023, a telecom company became one of a handful of large US employers to ban or limit using generative AI at work. [\nWaPo\n]\n\u2022\nGeographic winners.\n From the rise of personal computing to the birth of social media, Silicon Valley\u2019s influence over the global tech sector has lasted decades. The generative-AI boom could strengthen the region\u2019s dominance in technology. One in four generative-AI jobs in the past year were listed in the Bay Area, per a Brookings Institution analysis of about 2,200 job postings in roughly 380 US metro areas. Hubs that become early tech adopters often long benefit from the financial assets and skilled workforces associated with those technologies. [\nNYT\n]\nIn the coming decade, 20 to 30% of the time that workers spend on the job could be transformed by automation technologies.\nOn McKinsey.com\n\u2022\nAI\u2019s next frontier.\n After a tough year for tech talent and investment in 2022, enthusiasm for technology is growing. To help leaders track the latest developments, the McKinsey Technology Council\u2014including chair \nLareina Yee\n and coauthors\u2014identified 15 of the most significant tech trends. Last year\u2019s 14 trends remain relevant. One new trend, generative AI, could add as much as $4.4 trillion in economic value annually. Even so, generative AI is just one of many advances that could propel growth and solve complex challenges\n.\n\u2022\nSearch for skills.\n Between technology\u2019s potential to add value and organizations\u2019 ability to realize growth lies the great gulf of talent. Many of the most in-demand skills for these tech trends have less than half as many qualified practitioners per posting as the global average, our survey of 3.5 million job postings reveals. Companies should be ready to respond to shifts in the talent market (such as recent layoffs in the tech sector) and continue to look at how they can adjust roles and upskill workers.

    "body": "At WP Engine, serving you is our purpose, and we are focused on the continuous delivery of that value. We appreciate you trusting your sites and digital presence to WP Engine. We are writing to inform you of important updates regarding PHP. \nPHP 7.4 Extended Security Support:\n \nWP Engine is pleased to announce that we will continue to invest in ongoing security support of PHP 7.4 through 2024, as WordPress and a wide range of themes and plugins are still not fully compatible with PHP 8.0+, which could lead to critical errors on some websites. \nPHP 8.0 End-of-Life:\nPHP 8.0 will reach end-of-life (EOL) and no longer receive security support by the end of the year. In response to this, \nWP Engine will begin the EOL process for PHP 8.0, which means PHP 8.0 will no longer be available on the WP Engine platform by November 2023. \nWP Engine will perform automatic upgrades of all sites still on PHP 8.0 to PHP 8.2 before November and will communicate more specific dates in the coming weeks. You can read more about the upgrade process \nhere \n. \nWhat does this mean for you?\n \nWe encourage you to take advantage of PHP 8.2 now - there is no need to wait for your automatic upgrade. PHP 8.2 is a minor version change and a significantly easier upgrade process. Our recommendation is to use our \nPHP Test Driver \n, which allows you to preview your site on PHP 8.2, without impacting the live content your visitors see.\nAfter using the PHP Test Driver to verify your website is functioning as expected, please use our \nPHP Selector \nin the User Portal to perform your upgrade. It's that simple! \nOur team of WordPress experts are available 24/7 to assist with any questions you may have. Thank you for the opportunity to serve your business. \nNeed help? \nContact our \nSupport Team \n. \n\u00a9 WP Engine | 504 Lavaca St. Suite 1000 | Austin, TX 78701 \nNot the right contact for this account?

TOMORROW\u2019S INSIGHTS.\nA daily newsletter from McKinsey & Company\n \nBrought to you by \nLiz Hilton Segel\n, chief client officer and managing partner, global industry practices, &\u00a0\nHomayoun Hatami\n, managing partner, global client capabilities\nMotivating middle managers\nIn the news\n\u2022\nRedefining a role.\n Effective middle managers help companies survive disruption while retaining talent. But without a clearly defined role, they may burn out or default to individual-contributor work rather than leadership work. If that happens, people development could deteriorate. Allowing frontline managers a place in critical decision making could increase their engagement, according to a talent expert. Removing organizational bureaucracy may also help middle managers and their teams thrive. [\nFast Company\n]\n\u2022\nTight squeeze.\n Middle managers face a tricky balance between carrying out leadership\u2019s directives or implementing new policies and motivating their direct reports. What people want from work (development in addition to flexibility and higher pay) has changed, but managers often don\u2019t have the training or time to deliver these requests. A 2022 study of 20,000 workers found that more than 50% of managers identified as burned out. Executives who provide feedback in the form of coaching\u2014rather than demands\u2014can help managers feel more supported, a senior leader says. [\nFT\n]\nIf a person is passionate about their job, then let them stay where they are.\nOn McKinsey.com\n\u2022\nThe heart of it all.\n Management hierarchies\u2014climbing the ladder through a series of linear promotions\u2014might not appeal to everyone. Not every individual contributor wants to manage people, and not every middle manager desires a corner office. Think of middle managers as the connective tissue between tasks and the people who execute them. Organizations lose valuable employees when they get promoted to positions they don\u2019t enjoy, according to McKinsey partner \nEmily Field\n and colleagues (authors of the new book, \ufeff\nPower to the Middle: Why Managers Hold the Keys to the Future of Work\n).\n\u2022\nRethink promotions. \nMany companies are still in the dark about how to promote top performers while keeping them in the same role. Effective organizations, however, recognize the need to reward inspiring middle managers without drastically changing what they love about their jobs. This model works in the trades, where apprentices eventually become masters in their field. Some companies also allow people in technical roles to take a technical-career track, rather than appointing them to lead a team. \nLearn how to retain superstar middle managers\n without promoting them out of the roles that energize them.\nReward managers the right way\n\u2014 Edited by Gwyn Herbein, editor, Atlanta\nWas this forwarded to you? \nSign up here\n.\nOr \nsend us feedback\n\u2014we\u2019d love to hear from you.\nFollow our thinking\n \nThis email contains information about McKinsey's research, insights, services, or events.

TOMORROW\u2019S INSIGHTS.\nA daily newsletter from McKinsey & Company\n \nBrought to you by \nLiz Hilton Segel\n, chief client officer and managing partner, global industry practices, &\u00a0\nHomayoun Hatami\n, managing partner, global client capabilities\n\ufeffThe state of US consumers\nIn the news\n\u2022\nPinching pennies.\n US consumers are reining in spending on personal-hygiene products, and that includes everyday basics. From June 2022 to June 2023, consumers bought 3 to 4% fewer units of laundry detergent, toilet paper, and toothpaste, according to the consumer intelligence company NIQ. As shoppers trade down to cheaper brands and products, that could spell pain for retailers and consumer-focused companies that are accustomed to raising prices to cover higher costs. [\nBloomberg\n]\n\u2022\nSummer getaway.\n Travel fares are falling sharply in the US leisure industry, a welcome sign for government officials hoping to cool down inflation without tipping the economy into recession. Airline ticket prices dropped 19% from June 2022 to June 2023, while car rental rates decreased 12%, according to US government data. Demand for travel is still going strong. Roughly six in ten consumers have already traveled for leisure or are planning to do so in 2023, a recent survey of nearly 3,700 US adults found. [\nNBC\n]\n\ufeffFor the first time since the pandemic, the change in real year-over-year spending entered negative territory across all age and income groups.\nOn McKinsey.com\n\u2022\nSpending stalls.\n As we head into the summer months, temperatures may be rising across America, but consumer spending is heading in the opposite direction, McKinsey partner \nKari Alldredge\n and coauthors reveal. In fact, across all age and income groups, consumer spending (as measured by credit card expenditures) is lower than it was a year ago. Although the rate of decline was relatively consistent across demographic groups, low-income consumers showed the steepest drop in spending, at \u20134.5%.\n\u2022\nUrge to splurge.\n In April 2023, at least half of Gen Zers and millennials in every income group said that they were planning to splurge. But consumers don\u2019t always do what they intend: real year-over-year spending fell across all income groups that month. Still, some categories seem to be benefiting from the intent to spend freely. Travel was a top category for consumers wanting to splurge in the second quarter of 2023, and travel saw 2% real year-over-year spending growth in April.

Much like a relay race, the goal of the handover is to ensure that the next person is well positioned to perform even better after the baton is handed off. Based on interviews with some of the world\u2019s most well-known chief executives, McKinsey senior partners \nCarolyn Dewar\n, \nScott Keller\n, \nVikram Malhotra\n, and \nKurt Strovink\n suggest four best practices for CEOs who are thinking about the end game: deciding when to go, finishing the job of succession planning, ensuring a clean handoff to the successor, and embracing what\u2019s next. Check out the new \nMcKinsey Quarterly\n article\n and see what it takes to achieve a gold-medal-worthy finish to your CEO tenure.\n \nSending it forward: Successfully transitioning out of the CEO role\nGreat CEOs know that the transition to their successor will define their legacy and cement the strength of what they\u2019ve built.

TOMORROW\u2019S INSIGHTS.\nA daily newsletter from McKinsey & Company\n \nBrought to you by \nLiz Hilton Segel\n, chief client officer and managing partner, global industry practices, &\u00a0\nHomayoun Hatami\n, managing partner, global client capabilities\nTransform HR for better tech talent\nIn the news\n\u2022\nNeeded: new AI skills.\n AI adoption has renewed interest in established IT skills, but it also requires entirely new ones. Prompt engineers, AI compliance specialists, and AI ethics advisers are roles that didn\u2019t exist until very recently, and there is even demand to add AI-focused roles in the C-suite. Also needed: new security jobs, thanks in part to \u201cshadow IT\u201d\u2014employees\u2019 unapproved use of AI\u2014which exposes companies to new risks. Experts say two elements will set employees up to meet companies\u2019 needs: organizational knowledge, to understand what technologies companies actually require, and a commitment to continuous learning. [\nCIO\n]\n\u2022\nCourting tech talent.\n Following layoffs as well as a 33% decrease in job openings in the tech industry in the first three months of 2023, government agencies and a wide range of other employers, including hoteliers, financial institutions, and railroad companies, are snapping up tech workers who were once eager to work only for tech giants. Yet overall, there is still stiff competition for tech talent: the unemployment rate among American tech workers is just 2%. [\nAP\n]\n\ufeffMcKinsey\u2019s research and experience in the tech talent field show that the top 25 to 50 most critical roles can create the bulk of a company\u2019s potential value.\nOn McKinsey.com\n\u2022\nAnother company\u2019s gain. \nUnlike tech companies, incumbent organizations in other industries have historically had trouble attracting the tech talent they need. This year\u2019s tech industry layoffs create an opportunity for traditional players: McKinsey analysis from the first half of 2023 finds that more than 80% of laid-off tech workers find new jobs within three months, often with nontech companies. An end-to-end approach to HR can help attract\u2014and just as important, retain\u2014tech talent at these organizations, reveal McKinsey senior partner \nDana Maor\n and coauthors.\ufeff\n\u2022\nHR can get you far.\n A holistic HR approach looks at three S\u2019s for improving a company\u2019s tech workforce. For \nsourcing\n, identify the roles that create the most value and the skills needed for them, and search beyond the usual suspects both inside and outside the organization. \nSupport\n the hiring and onboarding processes with digital tools, and then \nscale\n technology expertise by using digital tools to meet employees\u2019 development needs. See how HR teams in banking, consumer goods, and other industries are improving their ability \nto recruit and retain top tech talent\n.\nUpdate HR processes\n\u2014 Edited by Heather Hanselman, editor, Atlanta\nWas this forwarded to you? \nSign up here\n.\nOr \nsend us feedback\n\u2014we\u2019d love to hear from you.\nFollow our thinking\n \nThis email contains information about McKinsey's research, insights, services, or events.

TOMORROW\u2019S INSIGHTS.\nA daily newsletter from McKinsey & Company\n \nBrought to you by \nLiz Hilton Segel\n, chief client officer and managing partner, global industry practices, &\u00a0\nHomayoun Hatami\n, managing partner, global client capabilities\nGenerative AI for CIOs and CTOs\ufeff\nIn the news\n\u2022\nNew software.\n With many businesses ready to embrace generative AI, tech companies are capitalizing on the moment. In recent months, multiple US tech corporations have announced the development of a suite of AI tools that will be able to take meeting minutes, evaluate written materials, and generate code. In June 2023, a San Francisco\u2013based cloud computing leader debuted an enterprise software package that offers nine generative-AI-based services. The company charges clients $360,000 per year, on the low end, to use its product. [\nNYT\n]\n\u2022\nWho\u2019s in charge.\n For organizations experimenting with generative AI, one question looms large: Who is responsible for leading the way? The technology\u2019s potential to transform processes throughout a company makes it tough to decide, executives explain. Some leaders are enlisting chief technology officers (CTOs) to prioritize AI projects, while others are establishing task forces and new AI-related roles. Earlier in 2023, a US tech company formed a ten-member AI council that includes staffers from its engineering, legal, and marketing divisions. [\nWSJ\ufeff\n]\nMcKinsey research shows generative AI can lift productivity for certain marketing use cases by roughly 10% and customer support by up to 40%.\nOn McKinsey.com\n\u2022\nTrillions at stake.\n With its potential to add $2.6 trillion to $4.4 trillion of value annually, the business world\u2019s excitement over generative AI seems well earned, McKinsey senior partner \nAamer Baig\n and coauthors say. Today\u2019s generative-AI boom offers a unique chance for CIOs and CTOs to guide the C-suite in turning the promise of generative AI into sustainable value for the business. It\u2019s worth remembering, however, that while many companies may experiment with new technologies, creating significant business value is often much harder\n.\n\u2022\nNine actions.\n To learn how organizations can be successful with generative AI, McKinsey spoke with dozens of tech leaders and analyzed generative-AI initiatives at more than 50 companies, including our own. As more people use generative-AI tools, we have seen some CIOs and CTOs respond by blocking employee access to publicly available applications to limit risk. Such companies, however, may miss out on opportunities to innovate. \nDiscover nine actions all tech leaders can take\n to create value, scale solutions, and manage risk for generative AI\n.\n\ufeffGet our guide to generative AI\n\u2014 Edited by Belinda Yu, editor, Atlanta\nWas this forwarded to you? \nSign up here\n.\nOr \nsend us feedback\n\u2014we\u2019d love to hear from you.\nFollow our thinking\n \nThis email contains information about McKinsey's research, insights, services, or events.

    "body": "Social networks will always prioritize users' content over brands\u2019 or sponsors\u2019 content, but we can work with that.\n \n \nHi Jacob!\n\u00a0\nIf you\u2019re reading this post, there\u2019s a 99.999% chance that your company is spending a meaningful amount of money on paid digital advertising. Ads.\u00a0\u00a0\n\u00a0\nIf we use EveryoneSocial as a proxy, chances are your company spends somewhere between $2,000-5,000/mo per employee on paid ads. That\u2019s a good amount of money.\u00a0\nIn 2023, companies are going to spend more than $65 billion on paid social advertising, such as sponsored posts, follower campaigns, etc. That\u2019s A LOT of money.\n\u00a0\nHowever, the big dirty secret with paid social is that over time the cost goes up and effectiveness \u2014 what your ads produce in return for every dollar spent \u2014 goes down.\nI repeat: As time passes, social advertising \ncosts increase and effectiveness decreases\n.\n\u00a0\nWhy? Because what\u2019s more important than ad revenue to Facebook, Linkedin, Twitter, and other social networks?\n\u00a0\nUSERS.\n\u00a0\nTo generate the most revenue from their ad offerings, these networks must \nacquire\n and \nretain\n the greatest possible number of users at all times. Just look at the social platform stock charts. The biggest spikes up/down are always associated with user growth/loss.\n\u00a0\nIn other words, users and the content they create are the foundation of any successful social network. They\u2019re its most important asset, which is why all the major social networks \nwill \nalways\n prioritize users'\u00a0content \nover brands\u2019 or sponsors\u2019 content.\n\u00a0\nHere\u2019s what Mark Zuckerberg had to say on the topic in 2018:\nWe built Facebook to help people stay connected and bring us closer together with the people that matter to us. That\u2019s why we\u2019ve always put friends and family at the core of the experience. Research shows that strengthening our relationships improves our well-being and happiness.\n\u00a0\nBut recently we\u2019ve gotten feedback from our community that public content \u2014 posts from businesses, brands, and media \u2014 is crowding out the personal moments that lead us to connect more with each other.\n\u00a0\nBased on this, we\u2019re making a major change to how we build Facebook. I\u2019m changing the goal I give our product teams from focusing on helping you find relevant content to helping you have more meaningful social interactions.\nWe started making changes in this direction last year, but it will take months for this new focus to make its way through all our products. The first changes you\u2019ll see will be in News Feed, where you can expect to see more from your friends, family, and groups.\n\u00a0\nAs we roll this out, you\u2019ll see less public content like posts from businesses, brands, and media.\nSo, what\u2019s a marketer to do?\nWe all need to reach prospective buyers, and social media is where they all are. Certainly, we\u2019re not going to stop spending on paid media, but how can a marketer thrive in this reality?\n\u00a0\nIn short, by enabling its employees to \nuse social media at work\n.\n\u00a0\nGiving your people access to an employee advocacy platform such as EveryoneSocial \u2014 to share company news, engage with their networks, and grow their personal following \u2014 is a fantastic way to turn the social media tables in your favor.\n\u00a0\nAfter all, in the eyes of social networks, employees are \u2026 wait for it\u2026 \nusers\n! Linkedin, Facebook, Twitter, Threads, Instagram, etc., doesn\u2019t distinguish between the personal and the professional you. You\u2019re just you: a person!\n\u00a0\nLet\u2019s take a look at some examples of the results your employees can generate via EveryoneSocial vs. using paid social ads.\n\u00a0\nThe leftmost column in the table below outlines top-of-funnel results our clients\u2019 employees generate through EveryoneSocial. By sharing content from our platform to their networks, employees acquire followers, drive clicks, and generate engagement.\n \nThese are conservative estimates. \u261d\ufe0f Seriously.\n\u00a0\nIf you were to attempt to generate these outcomes by running ads on any major social network\u00a0 \u2014 Facebook, LinkedIn, or Twitter, for example \u2014 you\u2019d very likely pay \na lot\n more than the values shown here.\u00a0 These are starting floors; e.g., Twitter advises that you budget a\u00a0\nminimum\u00a0\nof $3 per follower when running a follower campaign.\n\u00a0\nConversely, a single active employee on EveryoneSocial produces these same outcomes \u2014 by acquiring followers, driving clicks, and generating organic engagements \u2014 at a FAR higher quality (remember, they\u2019re people, not brands) and at a fraction of the cost. Literally cents on the dollar.\n\u00a0\nReady to be blown away?\n\u00a0\nUsing the results our clients\u2019 employees created over the first quarter of this year, multiplied by the average costs per outcome outlined in the table above, EveryoneSocial clients were able to generate the following value.\n \n\u00a0\nTo reiterate, by empowering their people to promote company news and content, EveryoneSocial clients generated more than $200 million in earned media value over the first half of the year.\n\u00a0\nWhat\u2019s more, they were able to generate that ROI for less than one-tenth of the cost of paid social.\n\u00a0\nExcited? You should be!\n\u00a0\nAny company can benefit from \nemployee advocacy\n, and it\u2019s definitely not too late to start. It requires a little time and money, but your investment will build something with lasting value.\n\u00a0\nAs always, we\u2019re here if you need us.\n\u00a0\nThanks for reading, and I hope you have a wonderful weekend!\n\u00a0\nBest,\n\u00a0\nCameron Brain\u00a0\nCEO & Co-Founder\nEveryoneSocial\n\u00a0\nP.S. - Feel free to connect with me on \nLinkedIn\n or \nTwitter\n!\nMake sure to follow us on social media!\n \n \n \n \nEveryoneSocial, 215 W Sego Lily Dr., #708100, Sandy, Utah 84070, United States \nUnsubscribe\n \nManage preferences",

TOMORROW\u2019S INSIGHTS.\nA daily newsletter from McKinsey & Company\n \nBrought to you by \nLiz Hilton Segel\n, chief client officer and managing partner, global industry practices, &\u00a0\nHomayoun Hatami\n, managing partner, global client capabilities\nGeneration gap\nIn the news\n\u2022\nFrom latchkey kid to leader.\n Boomers are making way for Gen X, the independent-minded cohort born from 1965 to 1980, to start calling the shots. With an average age of 54, newly minted CEOs are supporting more flexible, informal work habits. Given the choice, workers over 55 (boomers, for the most part) would want to spend roughly 35% of their working hours at home; workers in their 20s (Gen Zers) approximately 45%; and workers in their 30s and 40s (including millennials and Gen Xers) 50%, a Stanford University study found. [\nNYT\n]\n\u2022\nDon\u2019t \u2018circle back.\u2019\n Millennials and Gen Z workers have one request: please stop with the business jargon. Overrelying on idioms such as \u201cherding cats,\u201d \u201cboiling the ocean,\u201d and \u201cout of pocket\u201d are annoying younger colleagues and confusing workers who aren\u2019t native English speakers. This could hamper workplace inclusivity, according to research by LinkedIn and Duolingo. A survey of 8,000 workers in eight countries found that nearly two-thirds of millennials and 60% of Gen Zers long to hear less jargon in the office. [\nFast Company\n]\n\u201cGen Z verbalizes everything; they tell you what they want and don\u2019t want. Whereas you have to keep tabs on Gen Xers, because they might be quietly lining up a job elsewhere.\u201d\nOn McKinsey.com\n\u2022\nNot so different.\n As multiple generations work side by side at the office, people are paying more attention to age-based differences. New research on generational preferences at work reveals some interesting nuances between different age cohorts, but overall, every generation shares remarkable similarities. At all ages, employees want meaningful work, real connections with coworkers and managers, broader purpose, and fair compensation, partner \nBryan Hancock\n and McKinsey alumnus \nBill Schaninger\n explain\n.\n\u2022\nMore than a paycheck.\n Because Gen Z talks so openly about compensation, managers might assume that\u2019s all that matters to them, Schaninger says. Although money is a critical factor in younger workers\u2019 employment decisions, it\u2019s not their main priority. In the workplace, Gen Zers are motivated by having flexibility, opportunities for career development, and a supportive work environment, McKinsey analysis finds. \nSee how well generational stereotypes stack up\n against our actual research\n.\nLook before you judge\n\u2014 Edited by Belinda Yu, editor, Atlanta\nWas this forwarded to you? \nSign up here\n.\nOr \nsend us feedback\n\u2014we\u2019d love to hear from you.\nFollow our thinking\n \nThis email contains information about McKinsey's research, insights, services, or events.

Today, we want to highlight an effort from our friends at the \nClimate Clock\n. \nAt 12 noon ET on July 22 \u2013 the Climate Clock will tick down below 6 years for the first time, Meaning, we will have less than six years to dramatically reduce fossil fuel emissions in order to stay below 1.5\u00baC degrees warming. This timeline is based on\n IPCC & MCC data\n, the gold standards of climate science. \nOn July 22, people around the world will mark this moment \u2013\n \nClimate Emergency Day\n \u2013 with synchronized actions,\n bringing clocks from climate impact zones to the halls of power, demanding that governments and corporations #ActInTime to meet our climate deadline, and enact the real, system-wide solutions we need.\nYou can participate in many ways. \nSign up here\nGet your own Climate Clock to do a creative action \nPost creative content on social media or send an email blast the moment the clock ticks over - 12pm ET\nAmplify your climate related art project on this day\nCo-sponsor the day as an organization\nTo quote activist \nMariame Kaba\n, \u201cHope is a discipline,\u201d and we hope you will join us in urging governments and corporations to #ActInTime, so that we can maintain hope for a just future.\nPa\u2019lante,\nCarol Zou\nSecretary of Intentional Community,\nU.S. Department of Arts and Culture\nSent via \nActionNetwork.org\n.

What practices have brought the most progress in bringing diversity to leadership rank\n \nMarch 6, 2024 - \nEmployee Engagement: Tapping the Secrets of Energizing Workers\u00a0\nCompanies want their employees to be enthused and involved, yet employers need to be thoughtful in fostering these qualities in authentic ways. What\u2019s the latest thinking about how employers can understand the motivations of their workers\u2013and how to respond? What are the best methods for recognizing achievement, both individually and among teams? What\u2019s the connection between engagement and job satisfaction? In the hybrid work environment, what binds workers together and wards off anxiety and loneliness?\n \nApril 3, 2024 - \nBenefits that Fit Individual Needs Without Busting the Budge\nHaving made a commitment to recognize the unique needs of individuals, the secret is in the execution. What are the emerging benefits and rewards that workers are seeking, from fertility care to financial wellness? How can companies use technology to stay in close touch with what individuals are experiencing\u2013and where they need help as a result? How can companies choose among myriad point solutions and innovative new platforms? What are the most cost-effective rewards in terms of investments and outcomes\nMay 22, 2024 - \nThe Art and Science of Employee Retention, Coaching and Advancement\nWhile the pace of job-hopping has eased, employers have a powerful motivation to retain skilled workers, both for financial and cultural reasons. How can employers use new tools, including AI, to gain insights about what\u2019s inspiring their workers to stay committed\u2013or walk out the door? Since attrition is often caused by poor relationships with managers, what are innovative ways for employers to train their workers to be better leaders at a time when workers have higher expectations for job satisfaction? How can technology help make coaching more effective?\nJune 12, 2024 - \nBringing Talent Acquisition into the Digital Age\nDespite layoffs making headlines now, all the demographic and digital trends point toward tough competition for workers in the future\u2013maybe sooner than most expect.

How can these new tools, including AI, create better matches between employees and projects? How can employers gain insights from the data they gather? Why do real-world simulations help measure certain skills better than traditional assessments?\u00a0\n\u00a0\nJuly 17, 2024 - \nInnovative Benefits That Support Healthy Families and Caregivers\n\u00a0\n \nAs the pandemic\u2019s caregiving crisis showed, employers found significant gaps in their support for the parents and other caregivers in their workforces.

Where is the greatest demand for support, as well as the most innovative new methods? What have been the most cost-effective ways to help caregivers of all kinds, including parents as well as \u201csandwich generation\u201d workers caring for elderly and disabled relatives?\u00a0\n\u00a0\nAug. 7, 2024 - \nEmployee Engagement: Using Technology to Gain Insight Into Work Needs and Ambitions \n\u00a0\nTraditional methods like town-hall meetings and surveys can be effective, but data and well-drawn insights can give top leaders a heads up about evolving patterns and trends in their workforces. How can AI and other technology be deployed in a way that brings new insights yet still respects privacy and the individual human factors at play? What approaches will bring employers new empathy for worker needs, ambitions, and well-being?\u00a0\n\u00a0\n \n\u00a0\nAug. 28, 2024 - \nPursuing Higher Productivity With Human Factors in Mind\n\u00a0\n \nIn a competitive and uncertain climate, most companies need to do more with less.

Who should be the architects of a company\u2019s culture and how should it be designed and constructed? How should the culture be communicated, broadly and in everyday actions? How should a company start out on a project to evolve its culture in a credible way?\u00a0\u00a0\nOct. 16, 2024 - \nModernizing Your Workplace for a More Flexible, Inclusive Era\n\u00a0\n \nThe arrival of hybrid work sent virtually every employer back to the drawing board about what the workplace should look like, including floor plans, digital platforms, meetings, and even office furniture.

Yet this revolution presents new challenges for companies in choosing and supervising these tech tools. How should these tech platforms be evaluated? Which departments of the company should take responsibility\u2013and how can organizations coordinate these moves? How can companies make sure they\u2019re empowering their workers rather than overloading them with adaptation and distraction?\n\u00a0\n \nDec. 11, 2024 - \nPioneering Approaches to Digital Transformation and the Future of Work\n\u00a0\n \nThe emergence of generative AI in 2023 marked the arrival of a transforming technology that will change human roles, add and subtract jobs, and create astounding new capabilities.

Once stores reopened, customers who depended on buying online in 2020 shifted their spending to travel and other services. Retailers need more agility and flexibility built into their supply chains to keep up with unexpected changes in consumer demand and other shocks, so many are investing in forecasting technology and aiming to recruit data scientists. [\nWSJ\n]\n\u2022\nA new lease on life.\n As people move into different homes or remodel an existing space, their tastes and decorative needs may change, sparking a search on an online marketplace or other e-commerce site for just the right table or lamp. Online outlets attracted millions of consumers during the pandemic when brick-and-mortar stores closed their doors. While some buyers thrive on the thrill of the hunt, others may be attracted to an item because of its backstory. When consumers see an item displayed in a staged photo, that heightens their emotions and willingness to purchase it, a marketing professor said. [\nNYT\n]\nMcKinsey analysis shows that online sales in US retail jumped 40% year over year in 2021.\nOn McKinsey.com\n\u2022\nMind the (online) store.\n Buying goods online has become second nature to many consumers. In fact, online transactions are expected to account for nearly 25% of all worldwide sales by 2025. Larger retailers that had already invested in capabilities and infrastructure saw a jump in returns during the pandemic, but many small to medium-size companies realize a much smaller portion of revenue from e-commerce, McKinsey senior partner \nKarel D\u00f6rner\n and coauthors explain. Guarding against five short-term traps could help smaller retailers grow\n.\n\u2022\nLevel up your e-commerce.\n As customer preferences continue to shift postpandemic, companies of all sizes and types can benefit from rethinking their strategies for growth. Channels such as retail media networks and live commerce can help brands and retailers build stronger relationships with customers, while investments in operations (in addition to tech tools) can increase agility and flexibility. Learn how \ne-commerce can generate value\n for a wide range of organizations, including small and large retailers, brands, and consumer-packaged-goods companies\n.\nBoost online sales\n\u2014 Edited by Gwyn Herbein, editor, Atlanta\nWas this forwarded to you? \nSign up here\n.\nOr \nsend us feedback\n\u2014we\u2019d love to hear from you.\nFollow our thinking\n \nThis email contains information about McKinsey's research, insights, services, or events.

    "body": "Your monthly round up of tips, strategies, and insights to help you become a most loved employer.\n \n \nElevating moments that matter for your employees.\n\u00a0\nOk, here\u2019s what we know\u2026\n\u00a0\nGlobally, the majority \n(6 in 10) of employees are disengaged\n\u2014and that disengagement is \ncostly\n. Like $8.8 trillion costly \ud83d\ude48. But! Organizations that prioritize \ninvestment in employee experience (EX)\n are seeing \ngreater workforce productivity\n, \nmore innovation\n, \nmore employee resilience\n, and stronger overall performance.\u00a0\n\u00a0\nEmployee experience is the input that drives the outcomes our businesses need to survive and thrive. Which would make investment in EX a perfect solution to widespread disengagement, right?\u00a0\n\u00a0\nIn theory, absolutely. In practice, it\u2019s a bit more complicated. Because \u201cemployee experience\u201d is big. In fact, it\u2019s everything. Gallup defines employee experience as: \nthe sum of all interactions an employee has with an employer, from pre-recruitment to post-exit, everything from major milestones and personal relationships to technology use and the physical work environment\n.\n\u00a0\nSo where do we focus? How do we, as organizational and people leaders, \ndecide where to put our dollars\n to have the biggest impact on the employee experience and drive our businesses forward?\n\u00a0\nInvestment in employee experience should be ongoing and\u2014ideally\u2014follow guiding principles that are unique to your organization. But, as with anything in business, it\u2019s important to balance short-term and long-term strategies. The reality is most of us can\u2019t wait for slow, large-scale initiatives to kick in; we need to motivate employees yesterday.\n\u00a0\nFor organizations looking to make a noticeable impact on the employee experience right now, \nstart by elevating the workplace moments that matter.\n\u00a0\nMore than 2/3 of working Americans feel underappreciated at work\n but when people \ndo\n feel seen and recognized\u2014especially at critical milestones (e.g. after they\u2019ve gone above and beyond, experienced a particular triumph, \nachieved a marquee anniversary\n, etc.)\u2014they\u2019re more engaged, loyal, and willing to keep going above and beyond.\n\u00a0\nThere\u2019s no doubt that great employee experience is about many things, from offering comprehensive pay and benefits, to how your organization \nconnects employees to purpose\n, to the processes and systems that support consistent, equitable employer-employee interactions.\n\u00a0\nBut \nmeaningful employee rewards and recognition\n are a powerful piece of the puzzle because they allow you to nail particularly important moments in the employee lifecycle; and it\u2019s these moments that make up an employee\u2019s experience with your company, these moments that shape employee sentiment, commitment, and discretionary effort.\n\u00a0\nAs you look to second half of the year, avoid getting stuck in the \u201cwhole\u201d and consider how you can elevate the employee experience in moments and milestones.\n\u00a0\nBe well.\nNatasha Wahid\nDirector of Content\n \nDeep dive on a hot topic\n\u00a0\nNew research: Employee rewards and the employee experience.\n\u00a0\nFresh data from The Starr Conspiracy and Blueboard\n reveals that Employee Experience Leaders\u2014companies that place the highest level of importance and investment in employee experience\u2014are focused on strategic employee recognition and rewards. And they\u2019re seeing compound returns on their efforts to elevate the moments that matter.\n\u00a0\nGet the full report to learn:\n4 key employee experience indicators you can use to understand your organization\u2019s employee experience \u201chealth\u201d\nInsight into how EX Leaders invest in employee reward volume and variety\nWhich types of employee rewards have the most impact on the employee experience\nGet the full report\n \n \nFeatured love letter\n\u00a0\nA candlelit dinner cruise on the Danube, bike tour, and a Hungarian cooking class were the highlights of Eric B.'s Blueboard experience in Budapest!

This piece dives into the 6 main reasons people work (play, purpose, potential, emotional pressure, economic pressure, and inertia). The first three motives tend to \nincrease\n performance, while the latter three hurt it.

TOMORROW\u2019S INSIGHTS.\nA daily newsletter from McKinsey & Company\n \nBrought to you by \nLiz Hilton Segel\n, chief client officer and managing partner, global industry practices, &\u00a0\nHomayoun Hatami\n, managing partner, global client capabilities\nOffice space\ufeff\nIn the news\ufeff\n\u2022\nCubicle farm.\n You might not expect to see fresh produce growing inside an office tower. But in cities around the world, companies are converting empty office space into vertical farms. In one US building, greens and root vegetables are nestled in conveyor belts that move up and down automatically. The crops travel through varying levels of light and darkness that imitate a plant\u2019s 24-hour cycle. Since office towers are climate-controlled, they are ready-made places for growing food, an urban farming leader says. [\nSmithsonian\n]\ufeff\n\u2022\nCities\u2019 vacant offices.\n Schools are full of kids, and cruise lines are packed with travelers, but commercial real estate is still wrestling with high vacancies and lackluster demand. In 2026, when a third of US office leases expire, we can expect rents to fall and vacancies to climb higher still. That threatens cities that depend on commercial property taxes for a significant share of revenue. Rather than increase taxes, which might antagonize affluent residents, cities might highlight what they do best: green transit, walkable pathways, and cultural amenities. [\nAtlantic\n]\ufeff\nFalling demand for office space will drive down value. In the nine cities we studied, a total of $800 billion in value is at stake by 2030.\ufeff\nOn McKinsey.com\n\u2022\nEmpty spaces.\n Vacant office and retail space have grown sharply as hybrid work proliferates. Real estate faces tough challenges in the world's superstar cities\u2014places such as Beijing, Houston, and Paris\u2014which claim a disproportionate share of urban GDP and GDP growth. How long could the pain last? To find out, McKinsey modeled several scenarios. In a moderate scenario, demand for office space may fall 13% in 2030, compared with 2019. In a severe scenario, demand could plunge by as much as 38%, explain \nSven Smit\n, McKinsey\u2019s chair of insights and ecosystems and chair of the McKinsey Global Institute, and coauthors.\n\u2022\nHybrid places.\n As residents move out of the densest city areas, they\u2019re taking their shopping elsewhere. In metropolitan areas, foot traffic near stores remains 10 to 20% below prepandemic levels. Foot traffic is also recovering faster in the suburbs than in more heavily populated areas. Challenges like these may imperil the fiscal health of cities. Yet they might also prompt a historic transformation of urban spaces. Consider what actions cities, developers, and other stakeholders could take \nto turn empty spaces into hybrid places\n.\n\ufeffSee our new research\n\u2014 Edited by Belinda Yu, editor, Atlanta\nWas this forwarded to you? \nSign up here\n.\nOr \nsend us feedback\n\u2014we\u2019d love to hear from you.\nFollow our thinking\n \nThis email contains information about McKinsey's research, insights, services, or events.

But middle management can be a destination rather than a way station, say McKinsey\u2019s \nEmily Field\n, \nBryan Hancock\n, and Bill Schaninger, whose new book \nPower to the Middle: Why Managers Hold the Keys to the Future of Work\n comes out today. In a \nnew\n \nMcKinsey Quarterly\n article\n adapted from the book, they explain that middle managers play a critical role of connecting and integrating people and tasks, and should be viewed as being at the \ncenter\n of an organization\u2014which is why the best middle managers are often best off staying exactly where they are. Abandon the outdated assumptions about the middle layer of management and see why offering the right rewards to your most-valued managers can pay off in the long run.\n \nMiddle managers are the heart of your company\nStop thinking of middle management as a way station. Instead, make it a destination.\nOffer the right rewards\u00a0\u00a0\nQuote of the day\n\u201cMost of the focus for our customers today is around people and ensuring a people-first digital transformation.

    "body": "Actionable tools, industry trends, upcoming events, research, and more delivered to your inbox monthly.\n \n \n \nWhat if you knew a way to quickly and painlessly improve your company's performance assessment process? Last month in Culture Club we dispelled the myths and shared the science behind the most effective performance reviews.\n\u00a0\nWatch a replay of our \nPerformance Reviews\n\u00a0mini-workshop, to learn how to:\nCrowdsource performance review best practices from a wide range of companies\nLeave with a framework to assess the quality of your own reviews and a list of new ideas to implement\n \nWant to improve your company's performance assessment process?\nTalk with a LifeLabs Consultant\n \n \nAn important paradigm shift is happening in the purpose and process of performance reviews. For a long time, the primary goal of performance assessment was correction. Set performance standards \u2192 measure past performance against those standards \u2192 correct (or reward) performance. In this sense, performance and professional development were seen as one in the same. The only development that was deemed relevant was closing gaps in current performance to achieve current goals.\n\u00a0\nToday, companies \nand\n employees are recognizing that this Performance = Development approach is letting us all down.\n\u00a0\nBut divorcing performance from development entirely doesn\u2019t help either.\nWhen performance and development are separated, employees develop skills that aren't valued by their companies, causing inefficiency and frustration.\n\u00a0\nThe most successful and nimble organizations now take a Performance + Development approach.\u00a0\nThese companies create systems to ensure that employees are supported in achieving high performance today while also developing high leverage skills for the future. At LifeLabs Learning, we refer to high leverage skills as the skills that lie at the intersection of capabilities that companies need now and in the future + the skills that employees find personally rewarding and motivating to attain.\u00a0\n\u00a0\nContinue reading to learn how to integrate development into your performance reviews.\nRead more\n \nKeep learning with our \nPerformance Review Playbook\n:\na guide to help managers \nPeople Ops Leaders build or revamp their performance review systems.\n \nDo you have a LifeLabs experience you'd like to share with the world?

TOMORROW\u2019S INSIGHTS.\nA daily newsletter from McKinsey & Company\n \nBrought to you by \nLiz Hilton Segel\n, chief client officer and managing partner, global industry practices, &\u00a0\nHomayoun Hatami\n, managing partner, global client capabilities\n\ufeffCreating opportunities for UK minorities\nIn the news\ufeff\n\u2022\nWage inequality, meet pay transparency.\n According to data from the European Institute for Gender Equality, closing the gender employment gap could lead to between 3.5 million and 6.0 million new jobs being created by 2050. Wage transparency reporting is one tool countries are using to increase awareness of the issue. Since 2018, companies in the UK with more than 250 employees have reported average wage differences between men and women (based on a rough measure of what men and women earn on average across the workforce), while other countries allow workers to request comparable data. [\nWaPo\n]\ufeff\n\u2022\nUnderrepresented in retail.\n Even though women make up more than 50% of the UK retail workforce (one of the nation\u2019s largest industries), a new report shows they remain underrepresented in leadership roles. New data from a survey of more than 200 businesses reveals that only 41 boast female CEOs or CFOs, while just 13 have female chairs. In addition to the lack of gender diversity, businesses also lack racial diversity in the top ranks: about one-third of boards are made up of only White members. [\nBloomberg\n]\ufeff\nOur analysis shows that closing the pay gap could translate to a 30% increase in the average Black, Bangladeshi, and Pakistani woman\u2019s annual salary.\ufeff\nOn McKinsey.com\n\u2022\nFalling behind.\n UK workers who identify as Black, Bangladeshi, and Pakistani are the furthest behind on pay and labor force participation, and those who fall at the intersection of gender and ethnicity are particularly vulnerable. Compared with all other ethnicity and gender combinations, Black, Bangladeshi, and Pakistani women are at the greatest disadvantage, McKinsey senior partner \nTania Holt\n and colleagues reveal. While more women in these groups aged 16 to 25 are furthering their education and starting careers in higher-paying jobs, Black, Bangladeshi, and Pakistani women aged 26 and older face a growing disparity in pay as they continue their careers, due in part to an underrepresentation in leadership positions\n.\n\u2022\nFor the good of all.\n Improving women\u2019s earning potential translates to economic gains that benefit entire communities. But closing the pay gap for Black, Bangladeshi, and Pakistani women requires targeted effort on the part of employers, starting from an understanding of the economic and cultural experiences of these groups. Recruiting initiatives, professional network building, and transparency in the promotion pipeline could directly improve Black, Bangladeshi, and Pakistani women\u2019s experiences in their organizations. Consider \nfour meaningful actions leaders can take\n to address racial equality at work\n.\n\ufeffAdvance intersectional workers\n\u2014 Edited by Gwyn Herbein, editor, Atlanta\nWas this forwarded to you? \nSign up here\n.\nOr \nsend us feedback\n\u2014we\u2019d love to hear from you.\nFollow our thinking\n \nThis email contains information about McKinsey's research, insights, services, or events.

But even as new factories are popping up across the country, the US confronts a shortage of experienced workers. Vocational schools that partner with auto brands may provide part of the answer. One system of technical colleges in Tennessee has 34,000 students attending; in 2017, the school teamed up with a Japanese electric-vehicle (EV) maker to establish a new campus. [\nBloomberg\n]\n\u2022\nTeenage trainees.\n The EV revolution is here. There\u2019s just one problem: countries need many more skilled workers to produce EV batteries. Throughout Asia, Europe, and North America, many leaders are grappling with the same issue\u2014how to train and recruit battery engineers, technicians, and others needed for the energy transition. One Asian country is enlisting teenagers and trade school students to study battery technology; it aspires to add 30,000 more workers to the battery industry by 2030. [\nQuartz\n]\nSurvey respondents indicate that having caring and inspiring leaders is a top ten factor for staying in or leaving a role and an important reason for accepting a new job.\n\ufeffOn McKinsey.com\n\u2022\nVital skills.\n Auto and mobility leaders face significant skills gaps. But despite recent shake-ups, tech workers are scrutinizing potential employers. What matters most to this crucial part of the workforce? A McKinsey survey of about 1,500 US tech workers finds that career development is the most frequently cited reason for employment-related decisions, with 43% of respondents reporting it as a top factor for why they stay in a current job, accept a new role, or leave one, McKinsey partner \nAsad Husain\n and coauthors explain\n.\n\u2022\nAttracting talent.\n Seven of ten automotive leaders are focusing on building new businesses, previous McKinsey research has shown. Automotive and mobility incumbents now have a chance to snap up tech talent in what could be a singular realignment. However, that will require effectively outlining the expectations and commitments of the worker\u2013employer relationship. See four dimensions of an effective employee value proposition that \nauto and mobility leaders can consider as they seek to attract and retain critical tech workers\n.\nLearn what motivates tech workers\n\u2014 Edited by Belinda Yu, editor, Atlanta\nWas this forwarded to you? \nSign up here\n.\nOr \nsend us feedback\n\u2014we\u2019d love to hear from you.\nFollow our thinking\n \nThis email contains information about McKinsey's research, insights, services, or events.

    "body": "the best day to send emails for replies and the one you should avoid because of high unsubscribes\nOh YES! I have new stats I can share with you.\nWhy am I sending this newsletter on a Sunday? Read on, all will be explained :)\nAnd please allow me to geek out, I promise this will be worth it!\nYou might already know it, but we rolled out our advanced stats analytics about a month ago in QuickMail.\nSince then, it's been recording silently how well each email was sent and opened with proper day attribution.\nWhat's Day attribution? Instead of learning what day most emails are opened, I'm going to share with you the days it's better to\n *send*\n the emails to \nget more opens/replies/clicks\n.\nThis gives us beautiful insights into when we should be sending our emails (not when it gets open, which we have no control over. Big difference).\nWhat day do you think is the best one for optimizing opens?\nor minimizing unsubscribes?\nWell, when it comes to maximizing views, the weekend is your best choice\n by far\n.\nTogether, Saturdays and Sundays were responsible \nfor 1/3rd!! of all the opens\n detected on the system, with Sunday responsible for 18.66% of all generated opens on its own.\nWeekends clearly outperform all the other days of the week by a large margin.\nOpens rate:\nDays emails generating opens were sent:\nSunday: 18.66%\nSaturday: 16.92%\nTuesday: 13.43%\nMonday: 13.1%\nWednesday: 12.85%\nFriday: 12.67%\nThursday: 12.37%\nGiven these, you may be tempted to maximize sending on Saturday and Sunday, but know that we want people to actually \ntake action\n (reply or click on links) not just read their emails.\nClick rate:\nDays emails generating clicks were sent:\nSaturday: 16.9%\nMonday: 15.1%\nFriday: 15.07%\nWednesday: 14.05%\nThursday: 13.84%\nTuesday: 13.71%\nSunday: 11.33%\nLook at how poor Sunday is for clicks! Sunday was only responsible for 11.33% of total clicks detected, compared to 16.9% on Saturday.\nPeople who open emails sent on Sunday don't really want to engage in research/checking what this is about really.\nEmails sent on Saturday generate more clicks.\nCool, but what about replies?\nReply rate:\nDays emails generating replies were sent:\nSunday: 15.48%\nTuesday: 15.17%\nWednesday: 15.17%\nMonday: 14.11%\nThursday: 13.51%\nSaturday: 13.35%\nFriday: 13.20%\nReplies are clearly indicating that it's bad to send emails toward the end of the week, with Thursday, Friday & Saturday performing poorly. Don't you dare send cold emails on a Friday if you want an answer :)\nWe also learn that people are open for business for emails sent on Sunday! Sending on Sunday will get you the best visibility and best reply rate but don't expect clicks.\nThis may be a day when people try to quickly clean up their inbox before going to work on Monday.\nUnsubscribe rate\nI can explain previous stats but the truly shocking one is unsubscribes\u2026\nDays emails generating unsubscribes were sent:\nThursday: 30%\nTuesday: 16.48%\nWednesday: 12%\nMonday: 11.6%\nFriday: 10.78%\nSatursday: 10.48%\nSunday: 8.65%\nWOW, look at the difference between sending email on Thursday vs Sunday!\nAlmost a THIRD\n of the unsubscribes are coming from emails sent on Thursday! WTF? \nI have no idea why Thursday would lead to so many unsubscribes but if you have a theory, I'd love to hear it.\nConclusion\nIt looks like sending cold emails past Wednesday is a bad idea. It may be best to wait Sunday to start that new campaign after all :)\nIt certainly won't compensate for a bad copy, but it may give you an edge as you increase your odds of success.\nFuture?\nNow we have AI, we'll start tracking if people answering emails sent on Sundays are more inclined to reply positively or negatively. I'm super curious about this.\nAfter all, positive replies are what we are after. Are there days when people are more in the mood to reply positively?\nPlus, I'll provide information on how long it takes people to reply on average so you can optimize wait time between emails to maximize awareness without being too pushy and rubbing some feathers.\nSubCampaigns & AI\nWe finally rolled out SubCampaigns in QuickMail for every reply type we support with AI detection as well as Out of Office detection.\nWant to send a follow-up email asking them how their time out of the office went to get more replies? It's now possible.\nHead over to your account settings (Settings / Replies) and select the campaign to send (make sure your campaign starts with a Wait step so you don't send the email immediately)\nGot AI activated for your account? You are in luck.\nNo need to waste time to execute all the requests for unsubscribes, the AI automatically detects a request for unsubscribe and sets the prospect as Do Not Contact.\nIt won't even create an opportunity. No time wasted. Pretty neat.\nFinally, you can extend the idea to pretty much all replies. Head over to your campaign settings and configure the AI to automatically start a campaign base on the reply type detected.\nIt will skip the creation of an opportunity and start automatically the prospect on the new campaign.\nPodcast: Re-Engaging Your Prospects After Two Years?\nHow much later is it still ok to re-engage prospects? Apparently, even after two years.\nIn this week's episode, we tear down an Appsumo re-engagement campaign and highlight what's bad, what's good, and what could be much better.\nTeardowns are \npacked\n with actionable tips you can apply to your campaigns right away to get better results from your outreach.\nDon't miss it -> \nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LFESO0iCCJ0\nWant us to cover a specific topic? Shoot your idea over at \npodcast@quickmail.io\nTool of the week: Slite\nLooking for a Notion alternative that gives you easy access to your team's knowledge base\n? Check out \nSlite\n.\nSlite is a modern workspace that helps teams escape the chaos of information overload. It combines intuitive documents with async decision-making, enables teams to bring clarity to their work, and helps to take the pain out of finding info and learning from the past with it's AI assistant.\nFound a great tool that isn't known enough? Hit reply and let me know.\nThat's it for today.\nBe amazing,\nJeremy\nPS: Want to forward this newsletter to a friend?

Because social algorithms primarily promote and distribute content from individuals.\n\u00a0\nHere's why.\u00a0\ud83d\udc47\n\u00a0\n\u2611\ufe0f People prefer to learn and see what others they are connected with are talking about and sharing.\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u2611\ufe0f People trust people far more than they do ads, PR, and brands in general.\n\u00a0\n\u2611\ufe0f The social networks wouldn't have a business if there\u2019s no user growth and people aren't logging in. Think about it: If your social feed were only ads and brands when you logged in, you likely wouldn\u2019t use the platform very much.\u00a0\u00a0\n\u00a0\nThis doesn't mean that you should abandon your brand accounts and company pages \u2014 they still matter.\u00a0\n\u00a0\nBut what it does mean is that your company has a massive opportunity to build content distribution at scale by enabling employees to easily create, share, and engage with content.\n\u00a0\nWant to learn more about why and how you should activate employee influencers? I share all the details \nhere\n.\n\u00a0\nThanks for reading, and I hope you have a wonderful weekend!\n\u00a0\nBest,\n\u00a0\nCameron Brain\u00a0\nCEO & Co-Founder\nEveryoneSocial\n\u00a0\nP.S. - Feel free to connect with me on \nLinkedIn\n or \nTwitter\n!\nMake sure to follow us on social media!\n \n \n \n \nEveryoneSocial, 215 W Sego Lily Dr., #708100, Sandy, Utah 84070, United States \nUnsubscribe\n \nManage preferences",

TOMORROW\u2019S INSIGHTS.\nA daily newsletter from McKinsey & Company\n \nBrought to you by \nLiz Hilton Segel\n, chief client officer and managing partner, global industry practices, &\u00a0\nHomayoun Hatami\n, managing partner, global client capabilities\nMake room on the shelf\nIn the news\n\u2022\nThe science of hair care.\n Black consumers in the US spend $1.8 billion a year on hair products, but are three times as likely than other groups to say that they are unhappy with the available options. One consumer goods conglomerate is working to understand the chemistry behind what makes products work for curly and textured hair, as well as how consumers interact with them, by pairing a salon with an R&D lab. The project employs scientists, data analysts, and stylists to gather data and improve products. This information may help brands create more nuance for their products to gain more customer loyalty. [\nNYT\n]\n\u2022\nTo sell or not to sell.\n Many owners of small beauty businesses dream about being bought up by a larger company, but achieving that dream has become somewhat of a mixed blessing in the world of Black beauty products. Customers worry that if a brand is no longer Black-owned, the product formulas may change and not work as well, or become more expensive. But for small businesses, which often struggle to meet demand, being able to access the infrastructure of a larger company can help scale production faster and increase visibility. [\nHarper\u2019s Bazaar\n]\nToday, Black cosmetics brands make up only 2.5% of revenue in the beauty industry, even though Black consumers are responsible for over 11% of total beauty spending.\nOn McKinsey.com\n\u2022\nLooking for Black beauty brands.\n The first beauty brand marketed and designed exclusively for Black women hit shelves in 1973 and was revamped in 2019. The intervening years have brought an increase in products specifically for women of color, but supply doesn\u2019t meet demand. McKinsey senior partner \nTiffany Burns\n and colleagues note that beauty products designed for Black consumers account for, at most, 7% of the brands available in stores. Part of the disconnect stems from entrepreneurs\u2019 lack of access to capital and a strong business network, since Black people are still underrepresented within the beauty industry\n.\n\u2022\nBuilding up Black brands. \nAs part of our ten actions for racial equality that emerged in 2020, McKinsey has dedicated research to find the best ways to help Black beauty brands by tackling barriers on both the retail and the entrepreneurial side. McKinsey\u2019s work with the nonprofit Fifteen Percent Pledge, which urges retailers to dedicate 15% of shelf space to Black-owned brands, was focused on making sure the organization had pledges from the right mix of retailers so Black brands will show up in a variety of stores.

Have their efforts been successful? Creating impact that is both measurable and sustainable is both the most vital and most difficult aspect of DEIB work as well as of culture work more broadly. \nThis session explores LCW\u2019s Sustainable Culture of Inclusion Model (SCI), LCW\u2019s framework for understanding organizational maturity. LCW believes that the cultural diversity inherent in all organizations is an asset that can be leveraged to build high performance, and that sustainable cultures of inclusion are the foundation for this success. LCW deploys the SCI framework to diagnose organizational maturity along two axes: (y) the organizational culture and mindset, especially that of leadership and management, and (x) the systems which underlie the organization\u2019s people strategy. Using a collaborative discovery and workshop approach, LCW can diagnose your organization\u2019s level of sustainable inclusion and create a roadmap for advancement that also provides measurement milestones along the way.\nIn this session, presenters will share the theoretical frameworks used to develop the SCI Model, discuss the methodology for using the model to diagnose organizations\u2019 current state, and provide two case studies that demonstrate how the model has been used with client organizations. These case studies will reveal some of the specific actions organizations took to optimize systems and develop proficient mindsets. Ultimately, the goal is to create a Sustainable Culture of Inclusion that produces both a positive working experience and equitable outcomes for employees.\nAdd to:\n \n\u00a0Google Calendar \n\u00a0 \n\u00a0Outlook Calendar(.ICS) \n\u00a0 \n\u00a0Yahoo Calendar \nYou can \ncancel\n your registration at any time.\nPlease submit any questions to: \nj.pieczynski@lcwmail.com\n \nThank you! \nWAYS TO JOIN THIS WEBINAR \nJoin from PC, Mac, iPad, or Android\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Join Webinar\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\n \nIf the button above does not work, paste this into your browser: \nhttps://languageandculture.zoom.us/w/88930773713?tk=nA_T-8nGl5Kzwixf8cRLu5tFieuGVPqaasSifwdKkr0.DQMAAAAUtK_q0RZ6ZnFmZkxLbFFNT1ZTVWRNSTRWaHFnAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA&uuid=WN_ws77RvhoQdKycfCu-LYy5Q\n \nTo keep this webinar secure, do not share this link publicly. \n\u00b7\n\u00a0\u00a0 \nJoin via audio\nOr, dial: \nUS: +1 719 359 4580 or +1 720 707 2699 or +1 253 205 0468 or +1 253 215 8782 or +1 301 715 8592 or +1 305 224 1968 or +1 309 205 3325 or +1 312 626 6799 or +1 346 248 7799 or +1 360 209 5623 or +1 386 347 5053 or +1 507 473 4847 or +1 564 217 2000 or +1 646 558 8656 or +1 646 931 3860 or +1 669 444 9171 or +1 689 278 1000 \nMore International numbers\n \nWebinar ID:\n889 3077 3713\n\u00a0\n+1.888.799.9666\n \nCopyright \u00a92023 Zoom Video Communications, Inc.\nVisit Zoom.us\n55 Almaden Blvd\nSan Jose, CA 95113",

The hoped-for progress toward diversity, equity, and inclusion has prompted a backlash. And workers are mostly done quitting en masse, but their expectations about job satisfaction have only grown. On top of these issues, the arrival of generative AI is going to change virtually everyone's job. Company leaders will need to face fresh challenges, and From Day One's conferences in 2024 will be bringing them the latest ideas about these developing stories.\"\nWhether in person or online, From Day One\u2019s accredited events\u00a0bring together top executives and decision makers in HR, benefits, diversity, corporate culture, employee engagement, and corporate responsibility to discuss timely themes like hybrid work, employee benefits, diversity and inclusion, social impact, and employee well-being.\u00a0\nFrom Day One is recognized as the\u00a0pre-eminent\u00a0forum for corporate-values discussions. The company\u2019s in-person events break the typical conference mold by presenting in inspiring spaces, including art museums, opera houses, and centers of community gathering. From Day One was among the first to convene executives to address subjects like balancing productivity with well-being, developing diversity in leadership, supporting working parents, hybrid work, and offering better career paths, and the firm expects further evolution in the ways businesses and society will interact next year.\nEven as the company looks ahead to 2024, this year still has several From Day One conferences remaining in 2023. The company will travel to \nBoston\n on Sept. 12, \nManhattan\n on Sept. 26, \nPhiladelphia\n on Oct. 3, \nDenver\n on Oct. 18, \nLos Angeles\n on Nov. 2, and \nMiami\n on Nov. 14.

What are the key choices and thoughtful compromises that must be made for workers to thrive as well as produce? How can managers be trained to make the well-being of their workers a top priority? How can companies get a better sense of which benefits and rewards are most effective\u2013and encourage workers to take advantage of them?\nFeb. 14, 2024\nGetting to the Next Stage of Diversity and Belonging\u00a0\nAt a time of resistance and corporate austerity, DEI advocates will need to re-energize themselves and their organizations with new ideas, programs, and reasoning for the cause of diversity. What can DEI practitioners learn from companies with consistent success? How are companies changing their policies to respond to court rulings and lawsuits? What practices have brought the most progress in bringing diversity to leadership ranks?\nMarch 6, 2024\nEmployee Engagement: Tapping the Secrets of Energizing Workers\u00a0\nCompanies want their employees to be enthused and involved, yet employers need to be thoughtful in fostering these qualities in authentic ways. What\u2019s the latest thinking about how employers can understand the motivations of their workers\u2013and how to respond? What are the best methods for recognizing achievement, both individually and among teams? What\u2019s the connection between engagement and job satisfaction? In the hybrid work environment, what binds workers together and wards off anxiety and loneliness?\u00a0\nApril 3, 2024\nBenefits that Fit Individual Needs Without Busting the Budget\nHaving made a commitment to recognize the unique needs of individuals, the secret is in the execution. What are the emerging benefits and rewards that workers are seeking, from fertility care to financial wellness? How can companies use technology to stay in close touch with what individuals are experiencing\u2013and where they need help as a result? How can companies choose among myriad point solutions and innovative new platforms? What are the most cost-effective rewards in terms of investments and outcomes?\nMay 22, 2024\nThe Art and Science of Employee Retention, Coaching and Advancement\nWhile the pace of job-hopping has eased, employers have a powerful motivation to retain skilled workers, both for financial and cultural reasons. How can employers use new tools, including AI, to gain insights about what\u2019s inspiring their workers to stay committed\u2013or walk out the door? Since attrition is often caused by poor relationships with managers, what are innovative ways for employers to train their workers to be better leaders at a time when workers have higher expectations for job satisfaction? How can technology help make coaching more effective?\nJune 12, 2024\nBringing Talent Acquisition into the Digital Age\u00a0\nDespite layoffs making headlines now, all the demographic and digital trends point toward tough competition for workers in the future\u2013maybe sooner than most expect. What are the new techniques and tools that talent-acquisition can use to envision the workforce their company will need in the future? What data and insights can HR and TA leaders provide to the company to be ahead of trends? How can companies do a better job of internal recruiting and promoting internal mobility? What are the best practices for hiring based on skills and potential, rather than credentials?\nJuly 10, 2024\nLearning and Development: How New Tools Are Changing Upskilling and Career Mobility\u00a0\nAs employers put more emphasis on skills as the currency for worker development, they\u2019re seeking new ways to measure them, fill in gaps, and predict the skills needed in the future. How can these new tools, including AI, create better matches between employees and projects? How can employers gain insights from the data they gather? Why do real-world simulations help measure certain skills better than traditional assessments?\u00a0\nJuly 17, 2024\nInnovative Benefits That Support Healthy Families and Caregivers\nAs the pandemic\u2019s caregiving crisis showed, employers found significant gaps in their support for the parents and other caregivers in their workforces. The resulting scramble to help has produced a wealth of new HR policies, benefit offerings, and management practices. Where is the greatest demand for support, as well as the most innovative new methods? What have been the most cost-effective ways to help caregivers of all kinds, including parents as well as \u201csandwich generation\u201d workers caring for elderly and disabled relatives?\u00a0\nAug. 7, 2024\nEmployee Engagement: Using Technology to Gain Insight Into Work Needs and Ambitions\u00a0\nTraditional methods like town-hall meetings and surveys can be effective, but data and well-drawn insights can give top leaders a heads up about evolving patterns and trends in their workforces. How can AI and other technology be deployed in a way that brings new insights yet still respects privacy and the individual human factors at play? What approaches will bring employers new empathy for worker needs, ambitions, and well-being?\u00a0\nAug. 28, 2024\nPursuing Higher Productivity With Human Factors in Mind\nIn a competitive and uncertain climate, most companies need to do more with less. Yet if workers are their greatest asset, employers need to make sure the push for greater output is sustainable. What is the latest thinking about how to measure productivity, the means for stimulating it, and ensuring that workers have the energy to meet their goals\u2013as well as thrive over the long run?\n\u00a0\nSept. 18, 2024\nBuilding a Corporate Culture That Workers Can Understand, Influence and Embrace \n\u00a0\nCompany culture is amorphous yet vital\u2013the shared beliefs, values, traditions and behaviors that drive the actions of individuals and the organization as a whole. Who should be the architects of a company\u2019s culture and how should it be designed and constructed? How should the culture be communicated, broadly and in everyday actions? How should a company start out on a project to evolve its culture in a credible way?\u00a0\u00a0\nOct. 16, 2024\nModernizing Your Workplace for a More Flexible, Inclusive Era\nThe arrival of hybrid work sent virtually every employer back to the drawing board about what the workplace should look like, including floor plans, digital platforms, meetings, and even office furniture. After more than three years of experimenting, what have innovative companies discovered about what works\u2013and what doesn\u2019t? How have they improved workplace environments to be healthier, as well as more productive? How have these changes affected the goals of diversity, equity, inclusion, and belonging?\nNov. 20, 2024\nFinding and Deploying HR Tech That Will Empower Workers \n\u00a0\nThe blossoming of innovation in HR technology has given employers untold new abilities to organize, inspire, develop, reward, and care for their workers. Yet this revolution presents new challenges for companies in choosing and supervising these tech tools. How should these tech platforms be evaluated? Which departments of the company should take responsibility\u2013and how can organizations coordinate these moves? How can companies make sure they\u2019re empowering their workers rather than overloading them with adaptation and distraction?\nDec. 11, 2024\nPioneering Approaches to Digital Transformation and the Future of Work\nThe emergence of generative AI in 2023 marked the arrival of a transforming technology that will change human roles, add and subtract jobs, and create astounding new capabilities. How can companies manage the transition, both from the short-term competitive pressures to\u00a0 long-term corporate survival? How can AI be used to unleash creativity? Where are the areas for abuse, intentional or otherwise? How will digital transformation affect fields from talent acquisition to learning and development?\u00a0\n\u00a0\nABOUT FROM DAY ONE\nFrom Day One is a conference series and media outlet focused on innovative ways for companies to foster stronger relationships with their employees, customers, and communities.

TOMORROW\u2019S INSIGHTS.\nA daily newsletter from McKinsey & Company\n \nBrought to you by \nLiz Hilton Segel\n, chief client officer and managing partner, global industry practices, &\u00a0\nHomayoun Hatami\n, managing partner, global client capabilities\n\ufeffMarketing makeover\nIn the news\ufeff\n\u2022\nThe new CMO playbook.\n Three-quarters of chief marketing officers (CMOs) feel like they\u2019re being asked to do more with less, according to a recent Gartner survey of more than 400 marketing leaders. While talent and digital media costs are increasing, marketing budgets are decreasing amid ongoing economic uncertainty. In this new era of scarcity, marketing leaders should revamp their goals to match the long-term objectives of their organization and get buy-in from all stakeholders. [\nHBR\n]\n\u2022\nNeeding a human touch.\n Nearly one-quarter of the $88 billion per year that US brands spend on digital ad placements is wasted, according to a new report from the Association of National Advertisers. Optimizing for the lowest cost per click can lead to ads appearing on low-quality, made-for-advertising websites that don\u2019t see much human traffic. Instead, the report urges marketers to prioritize higher-quality media buys and to monitor which domains display ads during a campaign. [\nWSJ\ufeff\n]\n\ufeffNearly three dozen CMOs told us that, on average, their company boards demanded an 8% reduction in marketing expenditures over the previous 12 months.\nOn McKinsey.com\n\u2022\nThink before you cut.\n Rather than bluntly slashing marketing budgets, taking a strategic approach to marketing spend could deliver both cost savings and growth, even when times are tough. McKinsey senior partner \nKelsey Robinson\n and colleagues recommend that CMOs eliminate wasteful spending and redirect funds to areas that will deliver more long-term ROI. Thinking like an investor could potentially save companies 10 to 20% on inefficient marketing efforts and boost growth by 5 to 10%.\ufeff\n\u2022\nWhat\u2019s in your tech stack?\n Many organizations aren\u2019t making full use of the automated creative or analytics solutions they\u2019ve already invested in. CMOs should develop a thorough understanding of their current marketing tech tools and remove internal barriers that prevent implementation and continued usage. Read the full article \nfor more ways to recalibrate your marketing strategy\n and create value in times of uncertainty\n.\n\ufeffLet marketing drive greater value\n\u2014 Edited by Joy Merten, editor, Chicago\nWas this forwarded to you? \nSign up here\n.\nOr \nsend us feedback\n\u2014we\u2019d love to hear from you.\nFollow our thinking\n \nThis email contains information about McKinsey's research, insights, services, or events.

Have their efforts been successful? Creating impact that is both measurable and sustainable is both the most vital and most difficult aspect of DEIB work as well as of culture work more broadly. \nThis session explores LCW\u2019s Sustainable Culture of Inclusion Model (SCI), LCW\u2019s framework for understanding organizational maturity. LCW believes that the cultural diversity inherent in all organizations is an asset that can be leveraged to build high performance, and that sustainable cultures of inclusion are the foundation for this success. LCW deploys the SCI framework to diagnose organizational maturity along two axes: (y) the organizational culture and mindset, especially that of leadership and management, and (x) the systems which underlie the organization\u2019s people strategy. Using a collaborative discovery and workshop approach, LCW can diagnose your organization\u2019s level of sustainable inclusion and create a roadmap for advancement that also provides measurement milestones along the way.\nIn this session, presenters will share the theoretical frameworks used to develop the SCI Model, discuss the methodology for using the model to diagnose organizations\u2019 current state, and provide two case studies that demonstrate how the model has been used with client organizations. These case studies will reveal some of the specific actions organizations took to optimize systems and develop proficient mindsets. Ultimately, the goal is to create a Sustainable Culture of Inclusion that produces both a positive working experience and equitable outcomes for employees.\nAdd to:\n \n\u00a0Google Calendar \n\u00a0 \n\u00a0Outlook Calendar(.ICS) \n\u00a0 \n\u00a0Yahoo Calendar \nYou can \ncancel\n your registration at any time.\nPlease submit any questions to: \nj.pieczynski@lcwmail.com\n \nThank you! \nWAYS TO JOIN THIS WEBINAR \nJoin from PC, Mac, iPad, or Android\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Join Webinar\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\n \nIf the button above does not work, paste this into your browser: \nhttps://languageandculture.zoom.us/w/88930773713?tk=nA_T-8nGl5Kzwixf8cRLu5tFieuGVPqaasSifwdKkr0.DQMAAAAUtK_q0RZ6ZnFmZkxLbFFNT1ZTVWRNSTRWaHFnAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA&uuid=WN_ws77RvhoQdKycfCu-LYy5Q\n \nTo keep this webinar secure, do not share this link publicly. \n\u00b7\n\u00a0\u00a0 \nJoin via audio\nOr, dial: \nUS: +1 719 359 4580 or +1 720 707 2699 or +1 253 205 0468 or +1 253 215 8782 or +1 301 715 8592 or +1 305 224 1968 or +1 309 205 3325 or +1 312 626 6799 or +1 346 248 7799 or +1 360 209 5623 or +1 386 347 5053 or +1 507 473 4847 or +1 564 217 2000 or +1 646 558 8656 or +1 646 931 3860 or +1 669 444 9171 or +1 689 278 1000 \nMore International numbers\n \nWebinar ID:\n889 3077 3713\n\u00a0\n+1.888.799.9666\n \nCopyright \u00a92023 Zoom Video Communications, Inc.\nVisit Zoom.us\n55 Almaden Blvd\nSan Jose, CA 95113",

The demands and behaviors of consumers, suppliers, employees, and investors have rapidly evolved\u2014and this calls for a radical rethinking of long-held beliefs and practices, or a retail reset, say McKinsey\u2019s Steven Begley, \nBecca Coggins\n, \nDymfke Kuijpers\n, and \nFranck Laizet\n and their coauthors. In a \nnew article\n from \nMcKinsey Quarterly\n, they discuss the forces shaking up the industry and suggest the focus areas that should be at the top of the retail C-suite agenda, including owning the consumer relationship, setting a vision for a retail ecosystem, and more. See what\u2019s needed to reinvent retail.\n \nRetail reset: A new playbook for retail leaders\nIn light of unprecedented industry disruption, a retailer\u2019s actions today could determine whether it spends the next 20 years as a leader or a laggard.

Have their efforts been successful? Creating impact that is both measurable and sustainable is both the most vital and most difficult aspect of DEIB work as well as of culture work more broadly. \nThis session explores LCW\u2019s Sustainable Culture of Inclusion Model (SCI), LCW\u2019s framework for understanding organizational maturity. LCW believes that the cultural diversity inherent in all organizations is an asset that can be leveraged to build high performance, and that sustainable cultures of inclusion are the foundation for this success. LCW deploys the SCI framework to diagnose organizational maturity along two axes: (y) the organizational culture and mindset, especially that of leadership and management, and (x) the systems which underlie the organization\u2019s people strategy. Using a collaborative discovery and workshop approach, LCW can diagnose your organization\u2019s level of sustainable inclusion and create a roadmap for advancement that also provides measurement milestones along the way.\nIn this session, presenters will share the theoretical frameworks used to develop the SCI Model, discuss the methodology for using the model to diagnose organizations\u2019 current state, and provide two case studies that demonstrate how the model has been used with client organizations. These case studies will reveal some of the specific actions organizations took to optimize systems and develop proficient mindsets. Ultimately, the goal is to create a Sustainable Culture of Inclusion that produces both a positive working experience and equitable outcomes for employees.\nAdd to:\n \n\u00a0Google Calendar \n\u00a0 \n\u00a0Outlook Calendar(.ICS) \n\u00a0 \n\u00a0Yahoo Calendar \nYou can \ncancel\n your registration at any time.\nPlease submit any questions to: j.pieczynski@lcwmail.com \nThank you! \nWAYS TO JOIN THIS WEBINAR \nJoin from PC, Mac, iPad, or Android\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Join Webinar\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\n \nIf the button above does not work, paste this into your browser: \nhttps://languageandculture.zoom.us/w/88930773713?tk=nA_T-8nGl5Kzwixf8cRLu5tFieuGVPqaasSifwdKkr0.DQMAAAAUtK_q0RZ6ZnFmZkxLbFFNT1ZTVWRNSTRWaHFnAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA&uuid=WN_ws77RvhoQdKycfCu-LYy5Q\n \nTo keep this webinar secure, do not share this link publicly. \n\u00b7\n\u00a0\u00a0 \nJoin via audio\nOr, dial: \nUS: +1 719 359 4580 or +1 720 707 2699 or +1 253 205 0468 or +1 253 215 8782 or +1 301 715 8592 or +1 305 224 1968 or +1 309 205 3325 or +1 312 626 6799 or +1 346 248 7799 or +1 360 209 5623 or +1 386 347 5053 or +1 507 473 4847 or +1 564 217 2000 or +1 646 558 8656 or +1 646 931 3860 or +1 669 444 9171 or +1 689 278 1000 \nMore International numbers\n \nWebinar ID:\n889 3077 3713\n\u00a0\n+1.888.799.9666\n \nCopyright \u00a92023 Zoom Video Communications, Inc.\nVisit Zoom.us\n55 Almaden Blvd\nSan Jose, CA 95113",

    "body": "Hi Jacob Pieczynski,\nThis is a reminder that your webinar will begin in 1 hour: \nLearning with LCW\n:\n Creating a culture of inclusion that fosters high performance\nDate & Time\nJul 12, 2023 01:00 PM Central Time (US and Canada)\nWebinar ID\n889 3077 3713\nDescription\nIn the last three years, organizations have taken unprecedented steps to advance Diversity, Equity, Inclusion and Belonging in their organizations. Have their efforts been successful? Creating impact that is both measurable and sustainable is both the most vital and most difficult aspect of DEIB work as well as of culture work more broadly. \nThis session explores LCW\u2019s Sustainable Culture of Inclusion Model (SCI), LCW\u2019s framework for understanding organizational maturity. LCW believes that the cultural diversity inherent in all organizations is an asset that can be leveraged to build high performance, and that sustainable cultures of inclusion are the foundation for this success. LCW deploys the SCI framework to diagnose organizational maturity along two axes: (y) the organizational culture and mindset, especially that of leadership and management, and (x) the systems which underlie the organization\u2019s people strategy. Using a collaborative discovery and workshop approach, LCW can diagnose your organization\u2019s level of sustainable inclusion and create a roadmap for advancement that also provides measurement milestones along the way.\nIn this session, presenters will share the theoretical frameworks used to develop the SCI Model, discuss the methodology for using the model to diagnose organizations\u2019 current state, and provide two case studies that demonstrate how the model has been used with client organizations. These case studies will reveal some of the specific actions organizations took to optimize systems and develop proficient mindsets. Ultimately, the goal is to create a Sustainable Culture of Inclusion that produces both a positive working experience and equitable outcomes for employees.\nAdd to:\n \n \n\u00a0Google Calendar\n \n\u00a0 \n \n\u00a0Outlook Calendar(.ICS)\n \n\u00a0 \n \n\u00a0Yahoo Calendar\n \nYou can \ncancel\n your registration at any time.\nPlease submit any questions to: \nj.pieczynski@lcwmail.com\n \nThank you! \nWAYS TO JOIN THIS WEBINAR \nJoin from PC, Mac, iPad, or Android\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\nJoin Webinar\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\n \nIf the button above does not work, paste this into your browser: \nhttps://languageandculture.zoom.us/s/88930773713\n \nTo keep this webinar secure, do not share this link publicly. \nJoin via audio\nOr, dial: \nUS: +1 719 359 4580 or +1 720 707 2699 or +1 253 205 0468 or +1 253 215 8782 or +1 301 715 8592 or +1 305 224 1968 or +1 309 205 3325 or +1 312 626 6799 or +1 346 248 7799 or +1 360 209 5623 or +1 386 347 5053 or +1 507 473 4847 or +1 564 217 2000 or +1 646 558 8656 or +1 646 931 3860 or +1 669 444 9171 or +1 689 278 1000 \nMore International numbers\n \nWebinar ID:\n889 3077 3713\n \n \n \n+1.888.799.9666\n \nCopyright \u00a92023 Zoom Video Communications, Inc.\nVisit Zoom.us\n55 Almaden Blvd\nSan Jose, CA 95113",

TOMORROW\u2019S INSIGHTS.\nA daily newsletter from McKinsey & Company\n \nBrought to you by \nLiz Hilton Segel\n, chief client officer and managing partner, global industry practices, &\u00a0\nHomayoun Hatami\n, managing partner, global client capabilities\nManagers in the middle\nIn the news\n\u2022\nCoaching with tech.\n Employees\u2014especially those who began their roles in a remote environment\u2014crave coaching from managers, but a recent survey found that an increase in supervisory and training responsibilities makes leaders 520% likelier to burn out. Tech tools can help ease the burden of delivering personalized feedback. For example, one sales company uses AI to analyze live conversations between agents and potential customers. The digital platform provides real-time coaching while new sales reps make their pitches, so that managers don\u2019t have to spend hours listening in on calls. [\nHBR\n]\n\u2022\nA dearth of diversity.\n Many corporate DEI pledges that came out of the racial unrest of 2020 have not translated into meaningful gains for women and people of color, a 2023 study finds. An analysis of roughly 800 US public firms by researchers from Columbia Business School and the London Business School found that women comprise 39% of the workforce of those companies, whereas minorities constitute 36%. Among middle managers, only 6% are Hispanic and 4% are Black. Organizations become more racially homogenous at higher levels, the research also found. [\nFortune\n]\nOrganizations with top-quartile managers realize from three to 21 times greater TSR over five years compared with those whose managers are in the other three quartiles.\nOn McKinsey.com\n\u2022\nThe power of the middle.\n Organizations with top-performing managers yield stronger shareholder returns than those that don\u2019t, research by McKinsey partner \nEmily Field\n and colleagues reveals. But far from being the relationship builders they want to be, middle managers spend much of their time bogged down with administrative tasks. Only 20% of those surveyed strongly agree that their organizations help them to become better people managers, even though strong managers can reduce attrition, support talent acquisition, and bolster employee well-being and psychological safety\n.\n\u2022\nCharting a (middle) course to success.\n Successful middle managers aren\u2019t just nice to have; they are key contributors to both organizational health and financial performance. As such, organizations have an immense opportunity to invest in these vital roles. Leaders can, for instance, reset manager roles to remove unnecessary bureaucracy, investing in technologies to help automate tasks and reduce meetings so that managers can focus their energies on developing others. Consider five actions leaders can take to \nhelp their middle managers (and organizations) succeed\n.\nStrengthen middle management\n\u2014 Edited by Gwyn Herbein, editor, Atlanta\nWas this forwarded to you? \nSign up here\n.\nOr \nsend us feedback\n\u2014we\u2019d love to hear from you.\nFollow our thinking\n \nThis email contains information about McKinsey's research, insights, services, or events.

I am so sorry you have to cancel due to cost! I do have a couple of options for you that may help \n\u00a0\nI would be happy to extend our Partner discount to you if that will help you continue streaming...\u00a0 it is $40 off either Annual Plan (so $200 USD for the Basic Annual Plan or $428 USD for the Professional Annual Plan). Let me know if you would like me to apply that discount to your account \n\u00a0\nIf you are not wanting to upgrade to the annual plan then I should let you know we were offering a new Plan a while ago called the \nEssentials Plan\n. It has all the features of the Basic but you do have to keep our branding in the upper right. It is a small \"StreamYard\" print right next to your logo. That plan was being offered at $10 USD a month or $96 USD for the year. Let me know if that is something you are interested in and I may be able to make an exception and extend that offer for you.\n\u00a0\nBe sure and let me know if you have any other questions!\n\u00a0\nCheers,\nTrevor\n \nj.pieczynski@lcwmail.com\n \nJul 11, 2023, 12:08\u202fPM PDT \n--Cancellation Feedback--\nFeedback\n\u00b7 \ud83c\udfe6 Cancelled plan: professional (month)\n\u00b7 \u2139\ufe0f Reasons: tooExpensive\n\u00b7 \ud83d\udca1 Feature request: -\n\u00b7 \u2699\ufe0f Replaced by: -\n\u00b7 \ud83d\udcdd Comments: -\nInformation\n\u00b7 \ud83d\udcaa Primary team: HkmoW0BTvM9RX8e6IS1SJn1K\n\u00b7 \ud83d\udc64 Primary account: HkmoW0BTvM9RX8e6IS1SJn1K\n\u00b7 \u23f1 StreamYard user since: Thu Mar 17 2022 18:11:40 GMT+0000 (Coordinated Universal Time)\nCancellation flow version: v1\nThis email is a service from StreamYard - \nHelp Centre \n[K24ZMK-G1VGV]",

    "body": "Hi Jacob Pieczynski,\nThis is a reminder that your webinar will begin in 1 day: \nLearning with LCW\n:\n Creating a culture of inclusion that fosters high performance\nDate & Time\nJul 12, 2023 01:00 PM Central Time (US and Canada)\nWebinar ID\n889 3077 3713\nDescription\nIn the last three years, organizations have taken unprecedented steps to advance Diversity, Equity, Inclusion and Belonging in their organizations. Have their efforts been successful? Creating impact that is both measurable and sustainable is both the most vital and most difficult aspect of DEIB work as well as of culture work more broadly. \nThis session explores LCW\u2019s Sustainable Culture of Inclusion Model (SCI), LCW\u2019s framework for understanding organizational maturity. LCW believes that the cultural diversity inherent in all organizations is an asset that can be leveraged to build high performance, and that sustainable cultures of inclusion are the foundation for this success. LCW deploys the SCI framework to diagnose organizational maturity along two axes: (y) the organizational culture and mindset, especially that of leadership and management, and (x) the systems which underlie the organization\u2019s people strategy. Using a collaborative discovery and workshop approach, LCW can diagnose your organization\u2019s level of sustainable inclusion and create a roadmap for advancement that also provides measurement milestones along the way.\nIn this session, presenters will share the theoretical frameworks used to develop the SCI Model, discuss the methodology for using the model to diagnose organizations\u2019 current state, and provide two case studies that demonstrate how the model has been used with client organizations. These case studies will reveal some of the specific actions organizations took to optimize systems and develop proficient mindsets. Ultimately, the goal is to create a Sustainable Culture of Inclusion that produces both a positive working experience and equitable outcomes for employees.\nAdd to:\n \n \n\u00a0Google Calendar\n \n\u00a0 \n \n\u00a0Outlook Calendar(.ICS)\n \n\u00a0 \n \n\u00a0Yahoo Calendar\n \nYou can \ncancel\n your registration at any time.\nPlease submit any questions to: \nj.pieczynski@lcwmail.com\n \nThank you! \nWAYS TO JOIN THIS WEBINAR \nJoin from PC, Mac, iPad, or Android\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\nJoin Webinar\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\n \nIf the button above does not work, paste this into your browser: \nhttps://languageandculture.zoom.us/s/88930773713\n \nTo keep this webinar secure, do not share this link publicly. \nJoin via audio\nOr, dial: \nUS: +1 719 359 4580 or +1 720 707 2699 or +1 253 205 0468 or +1 253 215 8782 or +1 301 715 8592 or +1 305 224 1968 or +1 309 205 3325 or +1 312 626 6799 or +1 346 248 7799 or +1 360 209 5623 or +1 386 347 5053 or +1 507 473 4847 or +1 564 217 2000 or +1 646 558 8656 or +1 646 931 3860 or +1 669 444 9171 or +1 689 278 1000 \nMore International numbers\n \nWebinar ID:\n889 3077 3713\n \n \n \n+1.888.799.9666\n \nCopyright \u00a92023 Zoom Video Communications, Inc.\nVisit Zoom.us\n55 Almaden Blvd\nSan Jose, CA 95113",

TOMORROW\u2019S INSIGHTS.\nA daily newsletter from McKinsey & Company\n \nBrought to you by \nLiz Hilton Segel\n, chief client officer and managing partner, global industry practices, &\u00a0\nHomayoun Hatami\n, managing partner, global client capabilities\nAfrica\u2019s economic prospects\n\u2022\nPeople power.\n The success of the future global economy hinges on one continent: Africa. In Asia, Europe, North America, and elsewhere, fertility has been shrinking for decades. Populations are also aging quickly, outpacing the number of young workers. Not so in Africa, which will account for 420 million of the 428 million prime-age workers that are expected to join the world economy by 2040. Young Africans may provide the lift in productivity needed to counter a slowing global economy. Increasingly, the rest of the world depends on it. [\nForeign Affairs\n]\n\u2022\nGrowing and resilient. \nDespite shocks such as the COVID-19 pandemic, surging food prices, and higher borrowing costs, many African economies remain resilient. According to an index of the 100 businesses in the continent that are growing the fastest, companies in a wide range of sectors, including in commodities, fintech, healthcare, and renewable energy, expanded their businesses at a time of global lockdowns. Entrepreneurship is also alive and well. In 2021, tech start-ups garnered $5.2 billion, triple the amount they raised in 2020. [\nFT\n]\nIn Africa today, at least 345 companies have annual revenues of $1 billion or more.\n\u2022\nStill growing. \nAs home to the world\u2019s youngest and fastest-growing population, Africa presents many opportunities for strong, inclusive growth. This may enable Africa to improve its productivity and reverse the economic deceleration it faced from 2010 to 2019, according to McKinsey senior partner \nAcha Leke\n and colleagues. Today, 60% of Africa\u2019s population lives in poverty, yet half of its people live in countries that have thrived on the continent, and new McKinsey research finds that Africa is still growing and developing\n.\n\u2022\nShift to services. \nThe African economy has shifted profoundly over the past 20 years, as people left work in the fields to take jobs in trade and other services in cities. Employment in services increased from 30% to 39% over that period, although half the workforce remained in agriculture. The services sector makes up a large part of the continent\u2019s economic output, contributing 56% in 2019. \nSee more ways that the African economy is changing\n, and what role large private-sector firms can play in rekindling economic progress there\n.\nAccelerate growth in Africa\n\u2014Edited by Belinda Yu, editor, Atlanta\nWas this forwarded to you? \nSign up here\n.\nOr \nsend us feedback\n\u2014we\u2019d love to hear from you.\nFollow our thinking\n \nThis email contains information about McKinsey's research, insights, services, or events.

Clint asked Maura and me to pass along one other note to you, that he forgot to mention when he put together\u00a0the user guide.\nYour site is built using a page builder within WordPress called Elementor Pro. When Clint tried to get your license installed on the site, he got blocked by two-factor\u00a0authentication trying to log into your Elementor account.\u00a0\nIt looks like we need your help getting this set up under your account. Fortunately, it's super easy to do.\nIn WordPress, you'll just need to click the blue button at the top of the dashboard, and it will prompt you to sign into your Elementor account and connect it (screenshot below).\u00a0\nIt should be really simple -- mind letting us know that this worked okay for you?\nMy best,\nScott\n-- \nScott Daigger,\n\u00a0\nMBA, PSM, NPDP\nFounder, Owner\nBuddy Web Design & Development\nscott@buddywdd.com\n616-202-2273\nThis message may contain confidential information and is intended only for the individual named.

If you visit our social media accounts or website, you\u2019ll notice that these channels now feature our new look, embodying our renewed energy and commitment towards continuing this work for the next 20 years.\n\u00a0\nTo help you navigate these changes, I\u2019ve attached two documents that you should please prioritize reviewing as soon as possible:\n\u00a0\nBrand Launch Timeline Instructions\nThere are several changes you need to make to your own computer to ensure that you\u2019re adopting our new visual identity.\nThis document includes instructions on how to make 4 required updates and three optional updates to your personal device and social channels.\nWe will make time to cover these changes in our upcoming All Staff meeting, but you can begin updating your device on your own (send questions to Ashton or Jake).\nPlease complete the 4 required updates outlined in this document by Friday, July 14\nth\n.\n\u00a0\nBrand Talking Points\nThis document includes valuable information on how to talk about this change with your clients and ensures we all are talking about this new brand identity in the same way.\nYou\u2019ll also find information on the website and what this means for clients within this document.\nNo action is needed beyond your independent review of this document.\n\u00a0\nAdditionally, the consulting team will receive information this week on how to work with the design team in prioritizing training materials for redesign (additional time will be allotted to discuss this process at our upcoming staff meeting). This process will continue through the remainder of the year with the goal that our entire library be converted to the new brand identity by 2024.\n\u00a0\nThank you for your help in implementing this change \u2013 I hope you\u2019re as excited as we are on Team MarComm!\n\u00a0\nBest,\nAshton\n\u00a0\nAshton Vicente \n(she/her)\nCommunications Associate\nLCW\nWebsite\n\u00a0\n|\n\u00a0\nTwitter\n \n|\n\u00a0\nFacebook\n\u00a0\n|\n\u00a0\nLinkedIn\nView our upcoming events\n | \nSign-up for our newsletter",

TOMORROW\u2019S INSIGHTS.\nA daily newsletter from McKinsey & Company\n \nBrought to you by \nLiz Hilton Segel\n, chief client officer and managing partner, global industry practices, &\u00a0\nHomayoun Hatami\n, managing partner, global client capabilities\nHit the ground running\nIn the news\n\u2022\nReturn-to-work roulette.\n Postpandemic, the debate on returning to the office rages on, with offices at only 50% of prepandemic occupancy rates. Some companies are relying on carrots (for example, offering to make a $10 donation to an employee\u2019s preferred charity for each day that person works from the office) or sticks (making performance reviews contingent on attendance) to lure people back to their desks. They\u2019re also touting the benefits of impromptu meetings and in-person conversations. Other companies are making decisions about remote versus in-person work based on specific role functions. [\nNYT\n]\n\u2022\nMind the skills gap. \nA rapidly evolving job market means that the global skills gap is growing. By 2027, the world\u2019s labor markets will add roughly 70 million new jobs, but 83 million may be cut, according to the World Economic Forum. Its 2023 \nFuture of Jobs\n report lists the top ten in-demand skills, a mix of \u201csoft skills,\u201d such as curiosity and lifelong learning, and \u201chard skills,\u201d such as tech literacy. By recognizing the importance of a tech-literate workforce, employers could start reconsidering degree requirements and creating more flexible job paths. [\nFortune\n]\nA relentless focus on talent is the only way to bridge a huge capability chasm, since only 5% of our survey respondents say their organizations have the capabilities they need.\nOn McKinsey.com\n\u2022\nA need for speed.\n Organizational changes are afoot, touching everything from companies\u2019 working models (in person versus remote) to productivity (balancing the power of generative AI with its inherent risks). Research by McKinsey senior partner \nDana Maor\n and colleagues reveals that organizational structures often prevent leaders from responding to these shifts. By increasing speed\u2014removing hierarchy to empower employee-led decision making\u2014companies can be better prepared for the ongoing rapid pace of change. Forming smaller, cross-functional teams is one way to move at pace\n.\n\u2022\nLeadership redefined. \nChange without strong leadership can be disorienting for employees. Having the right talent in the right place and creating a culture of learning and flexibility can help companies succeed even during uncertain times. A top-down approach to understanding what people care about, from coaching opportunities to recognition for a job well done, means making leadership authentic and personal.

The rulings, one that overturned affirmative action\u00a0in higher education and another that invalidated a Colorado anti-discrimination law that protected the rights of LGBTQ individuals, while expected, were still shocking. They will set back the steady rise towards equality in our country over the last 60 years.\n\u00a0\nThese rulings challenge the heart of Diversity Woman Media\u2019s mission\u00a0to advance women, in particular women of color, into leadership, and to promote \nDiversity, Equity,\u00a0Inclusion and\u00a0Belonging \nin the business sector.\n\u00a0\nHowever,\u00a0these hurdles, while daunting, will not stop us. We have faced many obstacles before, and we know how to stay true, stay strong, and persevere. Long before these rulings, organizations across the country, in every sector, were mobilizing for this day. Not only will Diversity Woman Media stand tall with our countless allies, we will stay steadfastly committed to our purpose, and not miss a step in building a stronger, more diverse and inclusive workforce in which women can thrive in.\n\u00a0\nI urge you to join Diversity Woman Media in this new fight. Together, we can leverage the innovative tools and approaches we have already developed and successfully implemented,\u00a0to develop new strategies to continue our upward trajectory, and fulfill our quest to build a more diverse and inclusive America.\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\nCopyright \u00a9 2023 Diversity Woman, All rights reserved.\n \nYou are receiving this email because you registered for the Moving Forward Webinar. \nOur mailing address is:\n \nDiversity Woman\n1183 University Dr Ste 105\nBurlington\n, \nNC\n \n27215-8315\nAdd us to your address book\nWant to change how you receive these emails?\nYou can \nupdate your preferences\n or \nunsubscribe from this list\n.",

    "body": "Dear Jacob,\u00a0\nWhether it's new products and features or courses that teach you to use Zoom better, we are constantly evolving to improve your experience. To help keep you up to date, we have summarized some key new things you should know below. \nDownload\n the latest version of the Zoom desktop client to access all these features and more.\u00a0\nFor more resources to help you stay up to date, check out:\u00a0\nPreview notes\n \u2013 A list of upcoming features. This page is only available to Zoom account owners and admins; you must sign in to view them.\nRelease notes\n \u2013 A complete list of past releases across the Zoom platform.\u00a0\nIf you have questions about the features and announcements outlined below, please email customer-success-advisor@zoom.us.\n*Note: Some products and features may not be available to all customers.\u00a0\nZoom Learning Center Updates\nZoom Virtual Agent admin training is here\n -\n Zoom Virtual Agent is an intelligent conversational chatbot solution that uses the latest technology to understand and quickly resolve customer issues, and admins play a critical role in configuring these solutions for their organizations. Enroll in the Zoom Learning Center\u2019s latest course, \nWelcome to Zoom Virtual Agent\n, and learn everything you need to get started today!\nZoom Webinars user training gets a refresh\n - \nThe Zoom Learning Center team recently updated the \nZoom Webinars catalog\n to include information on all the latest and greatest features and enhancements. Start your learning journey today with confidence!\nKey Highlights from Zoom\u2019s June Releases\u00a0\nZoom Desktop Client\n Updates\nMeeting/Webinar Features\nZoom IQ Meeting Summary -\n Windows, macOS, Linux, Android, iOS -\n Hosts can initiate an AI-generated summarization of the current meeting. This summary is emailed and posted to Team Chat. The ability to receive the meeting summary can be restricted to the host alone, the host along with users on their same account, or extended to all attendees of the meeting, including invitees outside of their organization. All meeting participants will be notified that the summary is being generated, and the meeting host can stop the summary at any time, if necessary. This feature is available as a free trial for Zoom Pro, Zoom Business, Zoom One Business Plus, Zoom One Enterprise, Zoom One Enterprise Plus, and Enterprise Bundle accounts.\u00a0\nTeam Chat Features\nScreen sharing in Team Chat -\n Windows, macOS - \nUsers of Team Chat can instantly share their screen during a one-on-one chat. Similar to screen sharing options in meetings, Team Chat users have the flexibility to choose what they want to share and can even share multiple screens. This feature must be enabled by Zoom and will not be immediately available, as it is dependent on a backend server update currently scheduled for June 24, 2023.\nMail and Calendar features\nMobile mail support for Japanese, Spanish, French, and German -\n Android, iOS - \nZoom Mail UI and settings have been localized into Japanese, Spanish, French, and German languages. Previously, only English was supported.\nZoom Web\n Updates\nTeam Chat message retention logic -\n \nCloud storage retention logic is changed to be more simplified and predictable for group chats and channels that include members from different groups or accounts with different cloud storage retention periods. All group chats and channels will follow the cloud storage retention period of the owner for that group chat or channel. 1:1 chats will continue to use the shortest retention period between the users. Additionally, the web settings for chat retention are renamed to better convey what they control.\nChange to default for Immersive Scenes setting -\n \nThe Immersive Scenes setting will be enabled for all accounts. Please visit the \nrelease notes\n for detailed information on who is affected by this change.\nEnterprise feature release controls - \nAdmins on Enterprise accounts will be able to manage the release of certain new features or products into their environment. Account admins can select a timeline they are comfortable with for evaluating newly released features based on their needs for testing functionality, security, and compliance that are required by their organizational policy. Releases can be done manually or set to automatic release on a specific date. Admins can also track and review the timing of these changes through the Operation Logs report.\nChat Compose with Zoom IQ \n- \nAdmins can allow their users to utilize Smart Compose in Team Chat to write their messages by leveraging context from your conversation. You\u2019ll maintain the ability to change messages by adding tone, inputting prompts, or changing the length of the message to give you confidence in what you\u2019re communicating. This setting is available at the Account level.\u00a0\nZoom Virtual Agent\n Updates\nZendesk chat integration\n -\n Zoom Virtual Agent offers support for Zendesk chat integration, allowing businesses to seamlessly connect their Zoom Virtual Agent bot with their Zendesk instance for a better customer support experience. With this integration, end-users can easily connect with agents via chat if needed, while still using the Zoom Virtual Agent bot for initial queries.\nIntercom integration - \nAccount owners and admins can integrate Zoom Virtual Agent with Intercom to enable the users to chat with a live Intercom agent within the same UI.\nGorgias support channel integration -\n \nA new ticket creation integration channel has been added to Zoom Virtual Agent, allowing businesses to leverage the power of the Zoom Virtual Agent bot while providing end-users with the ability to create support tickets when needed. With this integration, the Zoom Virtual Agent bot can now render a ticket form, enabling users to submit their queries or issues directly as support tickets.\nZoom Phone\n Updates\nSMS support for US/Canada Toll-free phone numbers - \nAccount owners and admins can enable SMS functionality for their US/Canada Toll-free phone numbers. To activate this feature, they need to fill out a verification form and submit it to Zoom Support. The verification process typically takes up to four weeks. It is important to note that there is a charge per message when using SMS with Toll-free numbers.\nZoom Events\n Updates\nZoom Sessions licensing included in Zoom One Enterprise plan\n -\n \nThe Zoom Sessions 1000 license is included in the Zoom One Enterprise Plus plans. Adding Zoom Sessions to Zoom One Enterprise+ unlocks the premium webinar features on Zoom and gives the user additional access to Zoom Sessions on the Zoom Events platform.\nRestrict hub visibility on the Zoom web portal\n - \nAccount owners and admins can control the hub visibility options that are available to hub owners on Zoom Events. They can select if hubs will be public, internal, or hidden. This setting can be locked and is available on the Zoom web portal at the account or group level.\nWorkspace Reservation\n Updates\nWorkspace Reservation Beta licenses expiration\n -\n The Workspace Reservation Beta license is extended until July 28, 2023, until users renew their licenses. After the expiration date, users must purchase a Workspace Reservation license to continue managing and utilizing their workspaces.\nZoom Contact Center\n Updates\nConsumer engagement surveys\n -\n Zoom is introducing surveys for the Zoom Contact Center voice channel. This feature enables account owners and admins to create voice surveys that support various questions, including multiple-choice and long description. Surveys can be linked to voice queues. Admins can also define role permissions to determine who can view survey results on the contact center analytics dashboard. From the consumer perspective, the feature introduces post-call surveys for voice interactions. After the agent hangs up or a specified duration has passed based on the queue settings, the consumer will hear the survey questions. Consumers can respond to single-choice questions using DTMF or speech, provide ratings using DTMF or speech, and provide long descriptions using speech. This feature must be enabled by Zoom.\nChanges to phone numbers without SMS 10DLC campaigns\n -\n \nFor accounts with US/Canada virtual private numbers for SMS, account owners and admins must have an SMS 10DLC campaign assigned to the number for that number to be used as an entry point to a flow.\nBusiness Announcements\nZoom Software Lifecycle Policy -\n \nWe plan to enforce the fourth round of our Software Lifecycle Policy on August 5, 2023, for all products and services, starting with the minimum versions referenced in the table found \nhere\n. Users running an end-of-life version after August 5 will not be able to join meetings via the Zoom Client and will be prompted to update or join from the Web browser. As always, we highly recommend you regularly download and update to the latest version of Zoom software by checking for updates within the Zoom desktop client or by navigating to \nzoom.us/download\n to take advantage of all our latest security and functionality features.\n Note:\n The end-of-life enforcement for Zoom Room Controllers on Windows UWP has been extended to August 5, 2023.\u00a0\nHappy Zooming,\nZoom Success Advisor\nClick \nhere\n to unsubscribe from this list or manage your preferences \nhere\n.",

(There's also a PDF version you can download, which is linked at the top of the page.)\nHaving supported clients and their social selling programs for the last 5+ years I believe we're making the transition from early adopter to early majority.\nMost of the companies, such as the one featured in this case study, are early adopters. They're visionaries. They took a risk and it paid off BIG. \ud83e\udd11 In doing so, they've also helped to show the path forward.\nThere's no question in my mind that sales leaders and reps will regard social as being on or above par with email, phone, and text.\nBuyer demographics (younger), changes in the B2B marketing world (harder, more expensive), seller demographics (younger) point toward this.\nFeel free to email \u00a0me directly if you'd like to chat about anything included in the case study or the other things we're doing here at EveryoneSocial to support social selling programs.\n\u00a0\nAnd have a wonderful weekend!\n\u00a0\nBest,\n\u00a0\nCameron Brain\u00a0\nCEO & Co-Founder\nEveryoneSocial\n\u00a0\nP.S. - Feel free to connect with me on \nLinkedIn\n or \nTwitter\n!\nMake sure to follow us on social media!\n \n \n \n \nEveryoneSocial, 215 W Sego Lily Dr., #708100, Sandy, Utah 84070, United States \nUnsubscribe\n \nManage preferences",

Thanks for the update, and we're looking into this as well to see what options we have. It does appear to be a SSL / domain forwarding issue. Whereas when you type in \nhttp://www.languageandculture.com\n, it forwards correctly, but if instead you use https:// it does not.\nCoincidentally, I actually had another site that had a similar situation in the last week, but it was with GoDaddy as the domain registrar. When I tried to get that resolved, their tech team shared that the SSL isn't available with domain forwarding,\u00a0and that's why this happens. They didn't have a fix for it. Maybe I'm just stubborn or naively optimistic, but I feel like there's got to be some workaround.\u00a0\nThis is on our list of things we're working on, we'll let you know as soon as we can, hoping for good news here.\nThanks,\nScott\n\u00a0\nOn Mon, Jul 3, 2023 at 9:42\u202fAM Jake Pieczynski <\nj.pieczynski@lcwmail.com\n> wrote:\nGood morning Scott and Maura,\n\u00a0\nI hope you had a wonderful weekend.

TOMORROW\u2019S INSIGHTS.\nA daily newsletter from McKinsey & Company\n \nBrought to you by \nLiz Hilton Segel\n, chief client officer and managing partner, global industry practices, &\u00a0\nHomayoun Hatami\n, managing partner, global client capabilities\nThe social network effect\nIn the news\n\u2022\nTik, Tok, shop.\n After getting its start on Chinese social media, livestream shopping is growing in the US, with one research firm predicting that the country\u2019s sales could reach $50 billion by the end of the year. To capture growing demand, several e-commerce and social media companies are developing platforms that enable live product demonstrations and real-time purchases. One influencer and live-shopping show host said that consumers will sometimes buy up to 3,000 products in a single show. [\nCNBC\n]\n\u2022\nInfluencing by another name? \nA new group of online trendsetters called \u201cdeinfluencers\u201d are telling their followers what \nnot\n to buy. Typically, they try to dissuade users from purchasing overpriced products and participating in what they perceive as wasteful trends. While deinfluencers can keep brands honest, they\u2019re still part of the overall social media hype cycle\u2014and might even be paid by rival brands, a social media analyst shares. [\nCNN\n]\nGlobally, the social-commerce market is expected to grow to more than $2 trillion by 2025.\nOn McKinsey.com\n\u2022\nWaiting to hear back.\n McKinsey has identified social media\u2019s four primary functions for businesses, including using social channels to respond to consumer requests. While companies face growing pressure to be present and responsive online, only about half are meeting expectations for response time on social media, per a recent study. Addressing online complaints quickly could increase shoppers\u2019 positive feelings about a brand while delivering a great customer experience, McKinsey senior partner \nRenny Thomas\n and colleagues explain.\n\u2022\nBye-bye, brand loyalty. \nThree-quarters of customers changed the way they shopped, the products they bought, or tried a new store during the COVID-19 pandemic, senior partner \nKelsey Robinson\n and coauthors find. In a time of decreasing consumer loyalty, companies that personalize their social media channels may improve performance. Tailoring messages to individuals can lower customer acquisition costs, increase revenue, and drive conversions, studies show.

One of the symptoms is inadvertently excluding some in an attempt to include others. How can companies recognize when they need an intervention? What steps should they take to reverse the syndrome\u2013and who should manage the process? What will it look like when they embed belonding at the team and organizational level?\u00a0\nRegister now\n.\nLIVE EVENT\n \nSeptember 12: Boston, Massachusetts\nIn an environment of constant workplace change, how can employers create a consistent community that builds enduring bonds of trust with workers?

Subtle discrimination is vaguely disguised in commercials and employer branding, especially in the beauty and tech industries. Often times the About Us and Meet our Team landing pages can tell you more about a brand than the nicely polished imagery. If you\u2019re an organization that struggles to attract and retain experienced talent, join AARP Sr Advisor Heather Tinsley-Fix and New & Improved Principal Lisa Balser for a discussion on how ageism shows up in marketing and how employers can signal and implement a more inclusive culture.\u00a0\nRegister now\n.\nVIRTUAL CONFERENCE\n \nSeptember 20:\u00a0Building A Healthy Work Environment to Persevere Through Multiple Challenges\nOrganizations offering health care and wellness benefits maintain a stronger sense of employee loyalty. Yet health and well-being among employees goes beyond acute or specific physical or mental health needs. How can companies create a culture that emphasizes health through everyday experience? What are the hidden opportunities to nurture this kind of culture? Rather than relying only on standard \u00a0benefits to respond in times of unexpected distress, how can organizations address employee needs proactively?\u00a0\nRegister now\n.\nLIVE EVENT\n \nSeptember 26: Manhattan, New York\nIn an environment of constant workplace change, how can employers create a consistent community that builds enduring bonds of trust with workers?

But camaraderie and a sense of belonging have proven elusive without meaningful face-to-face contact and team-building opportunities.

TOMORROW\u2019S INSIGHTS.\nA daily newsletter from McKinsey & Company\n \nBrought to you by \nLiz Hilton Segel\n, chief client officer and managing partner, global industry practices, &\u00a0\nHomayoun Hatami\n, managing partner, global client capabilities\nCyborg sales\nIn the news\n\u2022\nEndless ad copy.\n Companies that need marketing and advertising services\u2014and the marketing services that need companies to hire them\u2014are embracing a new tool that may also pose new risks. It\u2019s generative AI (gen AI), and it can pump out infinite lingo, jingles, and catch phrases at little cost. While marketers delight in tech that can cut the cost of an ad campaign by 90%, fears of intellectual-property disputes and digital-ad giants taking an even greater piece of the pie abound. Copywriters and graphic designers also have much to gain\u2014and to lose\u2014as AI creeps deeper into the industry. [\nWSJ\n]\n\u2022\nBoss talk.\n A recent survey of 82 senior marketing executives revealed that they expect gen AI to help them cut costs by an average of 13%\u2014and 19% of respondents think that reducing internal head counts will make up the bulk of those savings. More than 60% of respondents said they think AI will help create new kinds of content, while 78% said it will lead to greater efficiency. Nearly half of the respondents predict their teams will shrink due to AI, and nearly half predict that marketing budgets will gradually be reduced. [\nWSJ\n]\nAt successful companies, we\u2019ve found there is a clearly defined AI vision and strategy and more than 20% of digital budgets are invested in AI-related technologies.\nOn McKinsey.com\n\u2022\nSales partner. \nA fifth of current sales-team functions could be automated, and organizations that invest in AI are seeing revenue grow by 3 to 15%, report McKinsey senior partner \nSteve Reis\n and fellow authors. Generative AI is particularly good at generating personalized content and communication, due to its ability to analyze customer characteristics, behavior, and preferences. While AI can speak directly to potential customers with personalized emails and chatbots, it can also function as an assistant to human salespeople, offering advice and reminders.\n\u2022\nSteps to success. \nCompanies can take six no-regrets steps to transform sales and marketing teams with AI. First, they can conduct an AI audit that evaluates how gen AI could fit in. Second, they can form a commercial gen-AI taskforce to explore opportunities. Next, by identifying low-risk use cases, they can begin testing; they can also start training the sales team in the basics to inspire further experimentation. Finally, companies can establish guidelines that protect sensitive customer data and establish a process for verifying output.

Ultimately, the goal is to create a Sustainable Culture of Inclusion that produces both a positive working experience and equitable outcomes for employees.\nIn this session, we will:\nShare the genesis & structure of the SCI Model\nDiscuss how we use the SCI model to diagnose organizations\u2019 current state\nProvide two case studies that demonstrate the model\u2019s impact\u00a0\nFacilitated by:\n \n\u00a0\nSarah Nodarse\nPrincipal Consultant, LCW\n \n\u00a0\nVince Bongiovanni\nAssociate Consultant, LCW\n \n \n \n \n \nCopyright \u00a9 2023 LCW, All rights reserved.\nLCW, 4753 N Broadway, Floor 2, Chicago, Illinois 60640, USA \nUnsubscribe\n \nManage preferences",

Thanks for the update, and we're looking into this as well to see what options we have. It does appear to be a SSL / domain forwarding issue. Whereas when you type in \nhttp://www.languageandculture.com\n, it forwards correctly, but if instead you use https:// it does not.\nCoincidentally, I actually had another site that had a similar situation in the last week, but it was with GoDaddy as the domain registrar. When I tried to get that resolved, their tech team shared that the SSL isn't available with domain forwarding,\u00a0and that's why this happens. They didn't have a fix for it. Maybe I'm just stubborn or naively optimistic, but I feel like there's got to be some workaround.\u00a0\nThis is on our list of things we're working on, we'll let you know as soon as we can, hoping for good news here.\nThanks,\nScott\n\u00a0\nOn Mon, Jul 3, 2023 at 9:42\u202fAM Jake Pieczynski <\nj.pieczynski@lcwmail.com\n> wrote:\nGood morning Scott and Maura,\n\u00a0\nI hope you had a wonderful weekend.

Thanks for the update, and we're looking into this as well to see what options we have. It does appear to be a SSL / domain forwarding issue. Whereas when you type in \nhttp://www.languageandculture.com\n, it forwards correctly, but if instead you use https:// it does not.\nCoincidentally, I actually had another site that had a similar situation in the last week, but it was with GoDaddy as the domain registrar. When I tried to get that resolved, their tech team shared that the SSL isn't available with domain forwarding,\u00a0and that's why this happens. They didn't have a fix for it. Maybe I'm just stubborn or naively optimistic, but I feel like there's got to be some workaround.\u00a0\nThis is on our list of things we're working on, we'll let you know as soon as we can, hoping for good news here.\nThanks,\nScott\n\u00a0\nOn Mon, Jul 3, 2023 at 9:42\u202fAM Jake Pieczynski <\nj.pieczynski@lcwmail.com\n> wrote:\nGood morning Scott and Maura,\n\u00a0\nI hope you had a wonderful weekend.

Thanks for the update, and we're looking into this as well to see what options we have. It does appear to be a SSL / domain forwarding issue. Whereas when you type in \nhttp://www.languageandculture.com\n, it forwards correctly, but if instead you use https:// it does not.\nCoincidentally, I actually had another site that had a similar situation in the last week, but it was with GoDaddy as the domain registrar. When I tried to get that resolved, their tech team shared that the SSL isn't available with domain forwarding,\u00a0and that's why this happens. They didn't have a fix for it. Maybe I'm just stubborn or naively optimistic, but I feel like there's got to be some workaround.\u00a0\nThis is on our list of things we're working on, we'll let you know as soon as we can, hoping for good news here.\nThanks,\nScott\n\u00a0\nOn Mon, Jul 3, 2023 at 9:42\u202fAM Jake Pieczynski <\nj.pieczynski@lcwmail.com\n> wrote:\nGood morning Scott and Maura,\n\u00a0\nI hope you had a wonderful weekend.

For some extra information like pricing or special offer, 4 hours is fine and provides a nice nudge/valuable follow up.\nAnother hack is to add spelling mistake(s).\nReally? in 2023?\nWell, these days, this may indeed backfire. It makes you look less professional, as many people know we are using cold email software to do the outreach.\nIn instant messaging though, it's quite human to send one message, then another that says:\n\"I meant Google, not Gmail\"... or something similar.\nThis works less so in email though, but it is worth a try for re-engaging campaigns to old existing clients, as it conveys speaking to someone you have a prior relationship with.\nFinally, another one that is hugely underrated is PS.\nPS in an email is a chance to mention something special and personal.\nIn fact, I believe this works almost better than a \"fake\" icebreaker and signal a genuine opinion or fact worth mentioning after the real reason you sent the email for.\n\"PS: for what it's worth, since you are in the cold email space, I would definitely check Jeremy's newsletter on cold outreach, I learned a few good ideas from it.\"\nSo give this a go and let me know how it goals.\n... I meant \"goes\" of course :)\nSave time & get more replies with AI + SubCampaigns\nSubCampaigns have the ability to stop the current campaign a prospect runs and send another campaign instead (using their reply/email).\nA simple example would be to send \"I hope you had a great time off ...\" to an out-of-office notification.\nWell, you are in luck, we just released the ability to start a sub-campaign automatically when detecting an Out Of Office (in your Account Settings / Replies)\nBut there are more interesting things we can do as our AI is becoming better and better at categorizing replies.\nNext week, we'll release the ability to start a sub-campaign based on any type of reply we support (interested, booking request, not the right time, not the right person...)\nOh, and while we were at it, we implemented automatic unsubscribe if we detect an \nunsubscribe request\n.\nI know how long it takes some of you to hunt down unsubscribe requests in all your inboxes. No More :) You can save your team hours each month by simply ticking a box!\nIn your account, go to Settings / Replies, and tick this box :)\nIf the option is not available, reply to this email and ask us to enable AI Categorization for your account. We'll do it for you at no extra cost. Just bear in mind we are still tuning it so it may be off a few times.\nDeliverability Stats \nMore on this next week I hope but I could not resist letting you know what one of our early users said to our support on a call.\n\"She said that the new analytics page is much more helpful for them because it gives them a better view of what's happening to their campaigns on a weekly basis.\"\n\ud83c\udf89\nPodcast: How to (Actually) Use Multi-Channel to 2x Your Reply Rate\nEveryone praises combining LinkedIn outreach with cold email... but how do you actually do it and get good results from it?\nIn this week's episode, we share our refined process from years of leveraging LinkedIn + Email outreach and answer the most common questions people have.\nThe episode is \npacked \nwith value.\n \nWatch it here\n.\nWant us to cover a specific topic?

TOMORROW\u2019S INSIGHTS.\nA daily newsletter from McKinsey & Company\n \nBrought to you by \nLiz Hilton Segel\n, chief client officer and managing partner, global industry practices, &\u00a0\nHomayoun Hatami\n, managing partner, global client capabilities\nWatching the world economy\nIn the news\n\u2022\nBanking on banks.\n Recent shake-ups in the US banking sector have had ripple effects across the world. That\u2019s partly because the US economy has been irrevocably shaped by its more than 4,000 banks\u2014more than any other country. A hundred years ago, the US had more than 30,000 banks, representing a historical lack of trust in big banks. Proponents of small banks say that their knowledge of communities enables them to offer more customized products and services, and that widespread access to loans fuels US entrepreneurship. However, smaller banks are also more susceptible to sudden economic changes. [\nNPR\n]\n\u2022\nUS inflation cools.\n The pace of inflation in the US slowed to 4.0% in May 2023, its lowest point in two years (after spiking to 9.1% in June 2022), government data reveals. Decreasing energy prices and a small uptick in food costs contributed to the decline. Some economists are keeping a close eye on housing inflation; costs related to housing went up 0.6% in May. Current conditions are \u201cencouraging,\u201d but the US might still experience an economic slowdown, albeit a delayed one, a chief economist said. [\nFT\n]\nThis volatility in the banking sector is likely one of the factors to have affected wider economic sentiment.\nOn McKinsey.com\n\u2022\nInflation still top of mind. \nCentral banks across the world are looking to maintain interest rate interventions in the hopes of tempering inflation rates. In many regions and countries, inflation continues to moderate but generally remains high. Interest rates and sentiment are weighing on growth projections, and the picture is somewhat patchy, explain \nSven Smit\n, McKinsey\u2019s chair of insights and ecosystems and chair of the McKinsey Global Institute, and colleagues. Growth in some emerging economies such as China and India are outpacing developed economies\n.\n\u2022\nUneven growth. \nIn advanced economies, inflation in the US has declined, partly due to falling energy prices. Energy prices also came down in the eurozone, although food prices remain high, and experts believe the UK may be able to avoid a recession in 2023. Meanwhile, India is set to contribute around 15% to global growth, making it one of the world\u2019s fastest-growing economies.

In order to move the needle on racial equity, it is crucial that we understand the varying needs of different groups, in addition to individuals with multiple \u201cidentities.\u201d In a \nnew article\n from the McKinsey Institute for Black Economic Mobility, \nTania Holt\n, \nTunde Olanrewaju\n, \nDara Olufon\n, \nAmmanuel Zegeye\n, and their coauthors explore the workplace experiences of Black, Bangladeshi, and Pakistani women in the UK, a group who are at the greatest disadvantage on key metrics of workplace equality compared with all other ethnicity and gender combinations, according to recent McKinsey research. Dive into the data and see what UK companies can do to improve their experiences and amplify impact on racial equity.\n \nRace in the UK workplace: The intersectional experience\nDespite meaningful progress, achieving workplace equity has proved challenging. Addressing intersectional communities\u2014such as Black, Bangladeshi, and Pakistani women\u2014could yield far-reaching benefits.\nHone DEI strategy\u00a0\u00a0\nQuote of the day\n\u201cEconomics helps you live your best life possible.

I\u2019ve let everyone know to hang tight as it\u2019s being looked at. \n\u00a0\nWe set aside some time to look at the website today and it\u2019s looking great! There wasn\u2019t anything beyond what we\u2019re going to do ourselves after getting access to the backend for the desktop version \u2013 thank you! We really like the ribbons in the scrolling box on Our Approach too!\n\u00a0\nMobile is looking really solid as well! There were just a couple things that didn\u2019t seem to be working on the mobile version that we wanted to call to your attention (below).

Thanks for the update, and we're looking into this as well to see what options we have. It does appear to be a SSL / domain forwarding issue. Whereas when you type in \nhttp://www.languageandculture.com\n, it forwards correctly, but if instead you use https:// it does not.\nCoincidentally, I actually had another site that had a similar situation in the last week, but it was with GoDaddy as the domain registrar. When I tried to get that resolved, their tech team shared that the SSL isn't available with domain forwarding,\u00a0and that's why this happens. They didn't have a fix for it. Maybe I'm just stubborn or naively optimistic, but I feel like there's got to be some workaround.\u00a0\nThis is on our list of things we're working on, we'll let you know as soon as we can, hoping for good news here.\nThanks,\nScott\n\u00a0\nOn Mon, Jul 3, 2023 at 9:42\u202fAM Jake Pieczynski <\nj.pieczynski@lcwmail.com\n> wrote:\nGood morning Scott and Maura,\n\u00a0\nI hope you had a wonderful weekend. We received a couple more messages over the weekend about the website being down.

It seems like this is either a redirect or DNS issue \u2013 could you please take a look so no other clients come across this?\n\u00a0\nWe scheduled some time this morning to officially check the website out.

You're a super partner to work with and hope we can on something else at some point.\nGlad to see the site go live! I think it really looks great. I may be biased but I think it has such a nice, fresh feel and very friendly. Hope it makes a big difference in everyone's perspective of the brand.\nAppreciate you keeping me in the loop and connecting me to Ashton in case something\u00a0comes up. Certainly glad to have your personal email so we can keep in touch!\nHave an amazing holiday!

The website is launching today/through this weekend so if you go to \nlcwinclusion.com\n or \nlanguageandculture.com\n you\u2019ll see it switched over by Monday. With the quick turnaround, we haven\u2019t had a chance to implement some additional feedback given by some folks \u2013 yours included. I really like your note about the different color overlays by section and wonder if that\u2019s a possible addition for future improvement. You\u2019ll notice the scary icon is still on the site too\u2026 we need to find a replacement for that after the launch as well.\n\u00a0\nI also wanted to update you that I\u2019ll be transitioning out of my role here at LCW on July 14\nth\n. It\u2019s been a great opportunity and I\u2019m proud to have collaborated with talented folks like yourself to redefine the brand and launch a new website, but I\u2019m going to head back into the nonprofit world, specifically in the education space, where my heart truly lies as Director of Marketing and Communications for an org here in Chicago (who also is experiencing an identity crisis after 20 years of work and a new direction). I know I have your email and phone number, but in case you need to reach me my personal email is \njacob.pieczynski@outlook.com\n. \n\u00a0\nWe\u2019re still working out some final transition details, but I think my colleague Ashton Vicente (\na.vicente@lcwmail.com\n) will likely be the contact I provide you in case you need anything LCW related moving forward. As this gets finalized, I\u2019ll ask her to reach out to you so you have her contact information.\n\u00a0\nAgain, thanks so much for your help! It\u2019s so exciting for this to launch this weekend.

Thanks so much for reaching out and sharing this! Thrilled to see it come to life :)\n\u00a0\nI certainly love the energy and the feeling of the graphics package and how the logo, typography\u00a0and colors expand the brand. Love it. It feels so much more vibrant, current and friendly. I'm going to have to steal a couple screen grabs of the current site before this goes live.\n\u00a0\nI don't have too much input to make. I really like the typestyling from eyebrow in all caps, the consistent\u00a0dark blue and weight of the headlines and the body copy works just as I had hoped for when there are some heavy paragraphs\u00a0of detail.\n\u00a0\nOne of my favorite things is when one independent arrow points to a negative space and then solid square. I would try to use that more often over the occasions\u00a0where it is just negative space and solid square. When possible, I do like when the square shifts to an alternate color from whatever that main section is. (Hope that makes sense)\n\u00a0\nAlso like how the logo can be repeated as a pattern in its single-color version. One thing that does throw me a little is the logo slightly rotated when it appears behind a single clipped person. Maybe it's fine as it give some extra life, but there is so much precision to the geometry, I feel some tension.\n\u00a0\nI wonder if the stock photos could be treated somehow to feel more \"owned\" by the brand. There are so many, it is hard to have a super-consistent\u00a0style, but I would create some screens. More candid and less-staged would be an important one. One trick that does work, and you can notice it in a few places already, is throwing a slight tone over the top of the image with translucency. See Our Impact page \u2013 the one on the bottom with the inset quote is likely my favorite on the whole site. Because the photos are frequent, I'd resist using the logo as a watermark again but maybe some other graphic could be applied. Or another trick would be to use the titles they represent (i.e. TRANSLATION, CONSULTING, CULTURE-FIRST) be the thing that is the watermark. That may be a whole new design language, but you probably get what I mean.\n\u00a0\nHere's one weird comment... the very first icon I saw was the Cross-Cultural icon:\nThis might be just me, but I see a confused or angry face like I just lost at Angry Birds. And now, you can't un-see that! ;)\n\u00a0\nThanks for all!\n\u00a0\nLet me know if any of my thoughts are confusing. Happy to chat any time!\n\u00a0\nTake care,\n\u00a0\nBrendan\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\nOn Tue, Jun 20, 2023 at 10:15\u202fAM Jake Pieczynski <\nj.pieczynski@lcwmail.com\n> wrote:\nHey Brendan,\n\u00a0\nHow have things been going with you?

Glad you got away. Gotta love Mexico and esp with a nice all-inclusive. Not having to plan meals and having drinks at the ready is the way to go :)\n\u00a0\nBad/sad news with Elgin Academy. As Rich predicted, some politics got in the way and FAR into development, they threw our work to a school alum that fancies herself as a branding/marketing expert. The board lead that hired us asked if we wanted to continue as support for her and we said... um, no thanks. Rich thinks they hurt themselves to the point of threatening the school's existence as they haven't created any marketing yet and it was needed in February to recruit new students. It's a real shame.

    "body": "Hi Jake,\nGood morning. Thanks for the update, and we're looking into this as well to see what options we have. It does appear to be a SSL / domain forwarding issue. Whereas when you type in \nhttp://www.languageandculture.com\n, it forwards correctly, but if instead you use https:// it does not.\nCoincidentally, I actually had another site that had a similar situation in the last week, but it was with GoDaddy as the domain registrar. When I tried to get that resolved, their tech team shared that the SSL isn't available with domain forwarding,\u00a0and that's why this happens. They didn't have a fix for it. Maybe I'm just stubborn or naively optimistic, but I feel like there's got to be some workaround.\u00a0\nThis is on our list of things we're working on, we'll let you know as soon as we can, hoping for good news here.\nThanks,\nScott\nOn Mon, Jul 3, 2023 at 9:42\u202fAM Jake Pieczynski <\nj.pieczynski@lcwmail.com\n> wrote:\nGood morning Scott and Maura,\n\u00a0\nI hope you had a wonderful weekend.

It\u2019s been a great experience and very informative regarding \nPwC (Price Waterhouse Cooper)\n immersion and research associated with metaverse experiences and engagement. The trainings are conducted on a yacht, which is fun. Their research indicates that training on soft skills like empathy development and other DEI training is highly effective in virtual worlds\u2026much more than either online or other remote learning. Students exhibited greater empathy, retention and ability to implement new skills by training in a virtual environment. The difference between other remote learning and virtual was significant. This might have applicability to other industries/fields like training physicians and other health professionals in being more empathetic listeners to PwD and other diverse populations. I see applicability to many industries.\n\u00a0\nAnyway, I have met folks from throughout the world. It\u2019s been a great experience and I\u2019m grateful for the opportunity. I have found the metaverse experience a great way to learn, engage with others globally, and incorporate play into the day\u2026which all research suggests is very healthy!\n\u00a0\nI\u2019d encourage you to find time to explore OC and attend one of the great \ncommunity events\n\u00a0\nSincerely,\n\u00a0\nPat \n\u00a0\nPat Maher | Director, Civic Engagement\n(he/him/his)\nSPR | 233 S.

TOMORROW\u2019S INSIGHTS.\nA daily newsletter from McKinsey & Company\n \nBrought to you by \nLiz Hilton Segel\n, chief client officer and managing partner, global industry practices, &\u00a0\nHomayoun Hatami\n, managing partner, global client capabilities\nThe future of wealth and growth\nIn the news\n\u2022\nStill fighting inflation.\n As central banks attempt to lower inflation to 2%, policy makers concede that they\u2019ll likely need more time to fight it\u2014which means continuing to raise interest rates for now. In Europe and America, government leaders say that prices are still too high and more progress needs to be made. For some countries, inflation initially cooled when economies reopened following the COVID-19-related global lockdowns. Since then, inflation has risen once more, spurred on by different sources such as strong consumer demand. [\nReuters\n]\n\u2022\nA fragile recovery.\n The world economy is expected to make a tenuous recovery in 2023 and 2024 as inflation and elevated interest rates continue to affect banking, consumer spending, and growth, according to the OECD. Although the economy is improving, risks abound, including the ongoing war in Ukraine and rising debt in developing nations. Global GDP is now projected to grow 2.7% in 2023, a 0.5% increase from the OECD\u2019s previous forecast. Economies in Asia\u2014including China, India, and Singapore\u2014will fuel much of that growth. [\nAP\n]\nProductivity growth among G-7 countries has been sluggish, falling from 1.8% per year between 1980 and 2000 to 0.8% from 2000 to 2018.\nOn McKinsey.com\n\u2022\nIt\u2019s one thing on paper. \nAsset price inflation over the past two decades created about $160 trillion in wealth\u2014on paper. At the same time, economic growth was sluggish, inequality rose, and every $1.00 in investment ended up generating $1.90 in debt. With recent turbulence in the banking sector and heightened geopolitical tensions, conditions have changed from the years of loose money and seemingly endless increases in wealth, according to \nSven Smit\n, McKinsey\u2019s chair of insights and ecosystems and of the McKinsey Global Institute, and colleagues.\n\u2022\nScenario planning, with a twist. \nAs leaders prepare for a potentially protracted period of economic uncertainty, McKinsey has modeled four possible scenarios to understand what the future might hold for the world\u2019s balance sheet. Three of them are far from ideal. However, in one scenario, investment strengthens and is productive, accelerating productivity growth. That could reshape the economic, banking, and investment landscape. Consider what actions decision makers can take to \nprepare for an unusually broad range of economic outcomes\n.\nSee the full report\n\u2014 Edited by Katherine Tam, editor, New York\nWas this forwarded to you? \nSign up here\n.\nOr \nsend us feedback\n\u2014we\u2019d love to hear from you.\nFollow our thinking\n \nThis email contains information about McKinsey's research, insights, services, or events.

This past week, more than 600 learning leaders gathered to connect and share ideas on how to prepare their people and organizations to move at the pace of change. From inspiring keynotes and breakout sessions to roundtable discussions and networking opportunities, the energy and passion of our training community left me feeling optimistic for the future of learning and development (L&D).\nDuring TICE, we also recognized the authors behind our 20 most-read articles of the year at the\u202f\nTraining Industry Readership and Editors' Awards\n luncheon. Congratulations\u202fto all the winners and thank you to everyone who contributes content to Training Industry.\nI hope that you find the resources in this newsletter helpful as you kick off the third quarter and continue executing your learning strategy. As always, we love hearing from you. Please email us at \neditor@trainingindustry.com\n.\nMichelle Eggleston Schwartz, CPTM\nEditor in Chief \nHot off the Press: Training Industry Magazine\u2019s Summer Issue\nThe Summer 2023 issue of Training Industry Magazine is out now!

Data mesh is a relatively new approach to data management. By decentralizing data to specific business domains like sales, marketing, or customer service, teams can have more ownership over their data and easily share it across the organization.\nHow does it work?\n A data mesh is as much \na cultural shift as it is a technological one\n. Part of this is thinking of \ndata as a product\n, rather than a by-product of a process\u2014and treating data producers as product owners, who can manage their own data and create policies with their best interests in mind.\nWhat are the biggest benefits of a data mesh?\n Organizations increasingly rely on efficient data collection, storage, and access so cross-functional teams can use it effectively, across the business. A decentralized data architecture is therefore great for scalability and accessibility, especially when used alongside \ncloud technologies\n. It reduces operational bottlenecks that come with centralized systems, freeing up technical teams so they can focus on more complex systems.\nWhere do I start?\n Moving to a data mesh means \noverhauling technology, processes, and the way people work\n. So you need to start with a solid strategy. This might involve investing in \nDataOps\n to accelerate design and development, as well as fostering a data culture across the organization.\nQUOTE OF THE DAY\n\u201cThe best companies try to look at technologies that are relevant and integrate them into end outcomes, such as productivity, experience, or, in some cases, efficiency.\u201d\n\u2014Biswa Misra, group chief technology officer and life operations officer at AIA Group, on the insurance industry adopting new technologies in \u201c\nModernizing the mindset: An interview with Biswa Misra\n\u201d\nchart of the day\n \nSee today\u2019s chart \nReady to unwind?\nWhat is e-commerce?\nE-commerce is the buying and selling of goods online.

    "body": "Hey Brendan,\n\u00a0\nI hope you had a great week and are preparing for a fun holiday weekend.\n\u00a0\nI really appreciated your notes and ideas on the website design. The website is launching today/through this weekend so if you go to lcwinclusion.com or languageandculture.com you\u2019ll see it switched over by Monday. With the quick turnaround, we haven\u2019t had a chance to implement some additional feedback given by some folks \u2013 yours included. I really like your note about the different color overlays by section and wonder if that\u2019s a possible addition for future improvement.

It\u2019s been a great opportunity and I\u2019m proud to have collaborated with talented folks like yourself to redefine the brand and launch a new website, but I\u2019m going to head back into the nonprofit world, specifically in the education space, where my heart truly lies as Director of Marketing and Communications for an org here in Chicago (who also is experiencing an identity crisis after 20 years of work and a new direction). I know I have your email and phone number, but in case you need to reach me my personal email is \njacob.pieczynski@outlook.com\n. \n\u00a0\nWe\u2019re still working out some final transition details, but I think my colleague Ashton Vicente (\na.vicente@lcwmail.com\n) will likely be the contact I provide you in case you need anything LCW related moving forward. As this gets finalized, I\u2019ll ask her to reach out to you so you have her contact information.\n\u00a0\nAgain, thanks so much for your help! It\u2019s so exciting for this to launch this weekend.

Thanks so much for reaching out and sharing this! Thrilled to see it come to life :)\n\u00a0\nI certainly love the energy and the feeling of the graphics package and how the logo, typography\u00a0and colors expand the brand. Love it. It feels so much more vibrant, current and friendly. I'm going to have to steal a couple screen grabs of the current site before this goes live.\n\u00a0\nI don't have too much input to make. I really like the typestyling from eyebrow in all caps, the consistent\u00a0dark blue and weight of the headlines and the body copy works just as I had hoped for when there are some heavy paragraphs\u00a0of detail.\n\u00a0\nOne of my favorite things is when one independent arrow points to a negative space and then solid square. I would try to use that more often over the occasions\u00a0where it is just negative space and solid square. When possible, I do like when the square shifts to an alternate color from whatever that main section is. (Hope that makes sense)\n\u00a0\nAlso like how the logo can be repeated as a pattern in its single-color version. One thing that does throw me a little is the logo slightly rotated when it appears behind a single clipped person. Maybe it's fine as it give some extra life, but there is so much precision to the geometry, I feel some tension.\n\u00a0\nI wonder if the stock photos could be treated somehow to feel more \"owned\" by the brand. There are so many, it is hard to have a super-consistent\u00a0style, but I would create some screens. More candid and less-staged would be an important one. One trick that does work, and you can notice it in a few places already, is throwing a slight tone over the top of the image with translucency. See Our Impact page \u2013 the one on the bottom with the inset quote is likely my favorite on the whole site. Because the photos are frequent, I'd resist using the logo as a watermark again but maybe some other graphic could be applied. Or another trick would be to use the titles they represent (i.e. TRANSLATION, CONSULTING, CULTURE-FIRST) be the thing that is the watermark. That may be a whole new design language, but you probably get what I mean.\n\u00a0\nHere's one weird comment... the very first icon I saw was the Cross-Cultural icon:\nThis might be just me, but I see a confused or angry face like I just lost at Angry Birds. And now, you can't un-see that! ;)\n\u00a0\nThanks for all!\n\u00a0\nLet me know if any of my thoughts are confusing. Happy to chat any time!\n\u00a0\nTake care,\n\u00a0\nBrendan\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\nOn Tue, Jun 20, 2023 at 10:15\u202fAM Jake Pieczynski <\nj.pieczynski@lcwmail.com\n> wrote:\nHey Brendan,\n\u00a0\nHow have things been going with you?

Glad you got away. Gotta love Mexico and esp with a nice all-inclusive. Not having to plan meals and having drinks at the ready is the way to go :)\n\u00a0\nBad/sad news with Elgin Academy. As Rich predicted, some politics got in the way and FAR into development, they threw our work to a school alum that fancies herself as a branding/marketing expert. The board lead that hired us asked if we wanted to continue as support for her and we said... um, no thanks. Rich thinks they hurt themselves to the point of threatening the school's existence as they haven't created any marketing yet and it was needed in February to recruit new students. It's a real shame. Plus, I loved what we did. Oh well. Maybe they'll come back to us before it closes!\n\u00a0\nI'll let you know when I get something in the mail from the invoice!

I\u2019m excited for the launch too \u2013 it\u2019s been a long time coming and while the website\u2019s not perfect it\u2019s going to be an improvement and a great foundation to build from.

I'm guessing the chances to complete this have passed, but if you're still looking for feedback in any capacity or for specific pages that you're still unsure about, I'd be more than happy to help before the potential launch date. I did take some time previously to review the most recent draft.\n\u00a0\nAgain, sorry I was unable to reach back out in a timely manner, but I will say I was impressed\u00a0by their work and am excited for the launch.\nPlease\u00a0let me know if there's any way I can help at this point.\n\u00a0\nJames\n\u00a0\nOn Fri, Jun 16, 2023 at 8:45\u202fAM Jake Pieczynski <\nj.pieczynski@lcwmail.com\n> wrote:\nHi James,\n\u00a0\nI\u2019m reaching out to you about the new LCW website.

TOMORROW\u2019S INSIGHTS.\nA daily newsletter from McKinsey & Company\n \nBrought to you by \nLiz Hilton Segel\n, chief client officer and managing partner, global industry practices, &\u00a0\nHomayoun Hatami\n, managing partner, global client capabilities\nThe art of data\nIn the news\n\u2022\nSymphony seating.\n Many operas culminate in tragedy, but major US orchestras are ending the latest season on a high note after audience attendance plummeted earlier last fall. In September 2022, attendance fell to about 40% of concert hall capacity from roughly 70%\u2014a \u201cvery visible, and very scary\u201d change, one leader said. As the 2022\u201323 season has progressed, however, orchestras have reported rebounding attendance. Still, sales of subscriptions remain sluggish, and audiences are also buying tickets later than before. [\nNYT\n]\n\u2022\nJobs lost.\n The performing arts industry in one US state shed ten years\u2019 worth of jobs during the COVID-19 pandemic, a recent study finds. A downturn in attendance, high inflation, and increasing rents contributed to a loss of roughly 59,000 positions from 2019 to 2021, bringing employment levels down to 2010 figures. Since the arts are so closely linked to other industries, such as restaurants and parking, the contraction could cut state and local tax revenues by $4.1 billion over the course of four years, the report noted. [\nLA Times\n]\nThe lack of high-quality, up-to-date, and standardized data sets limits the perspectives that art-institution leaders can have of their organizations\u2019 performance.\nOn McKinsey.com\n\u2022\nThe arts under pressure.\n Before the COVID-19 pandemic, art institutions were already struggling due to increasing overheads, changing audience behaviors, and funding shifts. COVID-19-related disruptions have only compounded these trends. In the US, changing consumer behaviors decreased audience ticket demand by up to 25%. While technology can help arts institutions strengthen resilience, many may lack the capabilities, processes, and infrastructure to build data and analytics tools, McKinsey senior partner \nBen Mathews\n and colleagues explain\n.\n\u2022\nMeasuring value. \nHistorically, art institutions have struggled to measure their value, which has limited their use of standardized performance metrics. As a result, art organizations often have an imprecise understanding of audiences, short-term views on revenue and growth, and planning methods linked to unreliable funding patterns. To help leaders increase their use of technology, McKinsey collaborated with seven leading US art institutions. Review a five-step framework \nleaders in the arts can use to build data and analytics capabilities\n.\nSee a sample data dashboard\n\u2014 Edited by Belinda Yu, editor, Atlanta\nWas this forwarded to you? \nSign up here\n.\nOr \nsend us feedback\n\u2014we\u2019d love to hear from you.\nFollow our thinking\n \nThis email contains information about McKinsey's research, insights, services, or events.

I\u2019m not sure if you had a chance to have the QA owner take a look at the mobile version, but it has some bugs \u2013 we tried to include screenshots of what we were noticing and are happy to chat through those. \n\u00a0\nThank you!\n\u00a0\nJake \n\u00a0\nJake Pieczynski\n(he/him/his)\nMarketing & Communications Manager\nLCW \n\u00a0\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\nwww\n\u00a0\n|\n\u00a0\nTwitter\n \n|\n\u00a0\nFacebook\n\u00a0\n|\n\u00a0\nLinkedIn\n\u00a0\nFrom:\n Jake Pieczynski \nSent:\n Tuesday, June 27, 2023 12:00 PM\nTo:\n Scott Daigger <\nscott@buddywdd.com\n>\nCc:\n Maura Murphy-Barrosse <\nmaura@buddywdd.com\n>; Ashton Vicente <\na.vicente@lcwmail.com\n>\nSubject:\n RE: LCW Website - Final Review & Sign-Off\n\u00a0\nGreat, thanks Scott!\n\u00a0\nJake Pieczynski\n(he/him/his)\nMarketing & Communications Manager\nLCW \n\u00a0\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\nwww\n\u00a0\n|\n\u00a0\nTwitter\n \n|\n\u00a0\nFacebook\n\u00a0\n|\n\u00a0\nLinkedIn\n\u00a0\nFrom:\n Scott Daigger <\nscott@buddywdd.com\n> \nSent:\n Tuesday, June 27, 2023 10:15 AM\nTo:\n Jake Pieczynski <\nj.pieczynski@lcwmail.com\n>\nCc:\n Maura Murphy-Barrosse <\nmaura@buddywdd.com\n>; Ashton Vicente <\na.vicente@lcwmail.com\n>\nSubject:\n Re: LCW Website - Final Review & Sign-Off\n\u00a0\nHi Jake!\nI'm jumping in for Maura here for expediency :)\nYes, please feel welcome to go ahead and check out the site on various browsers, devices, screen sizes, etc.\nMy best,\nScott\n\u00a0\nOn Tue, Jun 27, 2023 at 10:41\u202fAM Jake Pieczynski <\nj.pieczynski@lcwmail.com\n> wrote:\nHi Maura,\n\u00a0\nI hope you had a good weekend!

We will review together on our call tomorrow, Tuesday 6/27, at 2pm CT.\u00a0\n\u00a0\nBefore reviewing the site, please see the following notes (many are regarding recent feedback):\nDownloadable resources - when a user goes to a resource, the popup will come up prompting them to put in their email. Once the user inputs their email, it unlocks the blog post. Hopefully this is an acceptable compromise.\nOther Solutions Slider - Pictures were originally clickable as well, but it was flagged as an accessibility issue. All links need to have discernible text (even if the image has alt text. Sorry we know this is not ideal)\nWe have confirmed that Poppins is being used in all titles everywhere. Some of the smaller titles are in all Caps (like on staff blocks)\n\"The image that\u2019s used in the browser tabs is elongated and looks off. Can we swap that out with a transparent background version of the ribbon that doesn\u2019t stretch? We can provide new files as needed!\"\n - It might not be best idea to make the ribbon transparent, because some people have dark mode on their browser and the ribbon will have a black background, but I changed this so it's more of a badge shape and it should look a lot better now\n\"Can you please change the scrolling boxes to match the color of the corresponding box in the SCI graphic\"\n - We can't do the exact color. Those boxes need to have a certain level of contrast in order to pass accessibility standards. So we can't make them too light.\n\"When an event is past it seems to say \u201cExpired!\u201d \u2013 is there a work around for that/what\u2019s the options post-event for these pages?\"\n - So this is how the current events work as of right now: When an event is active, there will be a button that says \"Reserve your seat\" that links to a hubspot form. When the event is expired, an LCW staff member will need to go into the event and add the link to the recording. Once that is done, it will show a button to watch a recording (blocked by a popup to capture their email address). Here is a test example: \nhttps://lcw1.wpengine.com/events/brave-conversations-with-lcw-live-lets-talk-about-why-juneteenth-matters/\n If the recording link isn't added, then the event will just say \"expired!\" with no button.\nOn the contact page, after submitting contact form, the page redirects to the bottom of the screen instead of where the success message appears - This has something to do with Hubspot forms and we can't adjust it.\nTranslations - We believe what we agreed upon is that we were going to get the translation plugin installed and set up, and LCW will have to go in and work on manually translating every webpage. When you click the different translation options, it won't work until the pages are actually translated. So maybe we just turn this feature off for now?\nAlso, please confirm that the domain is switching to \nlcwinclusion.com\n. Thanks!\n\u00a0\nLooking forward to meeting with you tomorrow.\u00a0\n\u00a0\nBest,\nMaura\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\nMaura Murphy-Barrosse\nProject Manager\nBuddy Web Design & Development\nmaura@buddywdd.com\n323-868-6083\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\nThis message may contain confidential information and is intended only for the individual named.

Would one of you be willing to send out the attached documents and message on Monday at noon? Waiting until noon will give Ashton and I time to make sure the social channels and website have been updated.\n\u00a0\nSending this from your email will help reenforce it\u2019s importance! Please feel free to review and let me know any questions/notes.\n\u00a0\nThank you!! \n\u00a0\nJake\n\u00a0\n-------------------\n\u00a0\nSend time: Monday, July 3 @12pm \n\u00a0\nSubject: Action Required: LCW\u2019s New Branding Has Launched!\n\u00a0\nHi team,\n\u00a0\nToday marks an exciting new beginning for LCW \u2013 as of today our new LCW branding has officially launched! If you visit our social media accounts or website, you\u2019ll notice that these channels now feature our new look, embodying our renewed energy and commitment towards continuing this work for the next 20 years.\n\u00a0\nTo help you navigate these changes, we\u2019re attaching two documents that we ask you prioritize reviewing as soon as possible:\n\u00a0\nBrand Launch Timeline Instructions\nThere are several changes we need you to make to your own computer to ensure that you\u2019re adopting our new visual identity\nThis document includes instructions on how to make 4 required updates and three optional updates to your personal device and social channels\nWe will make time to cover these changes in our upcoming All Staff meeting, but you can begin updating your device on your own (send questions to Jake)\nPlease complete the 4 required updates outlined in this document by Friday, July 14\nth\n\u00a0\nBrand Talking Points\nThis document includes valuable information on how to talk about this change with your clients and ensures we all are talking about this new brand identity in the same way\nYou\u2019ll also find information on the website and what this means for clients within this document\nNo action is needed beyond your independent review of this document\n\u00a0\nAdditionally, the consulting team will receive information this week on how to work with the design team in prioritizing training materials for redesign (additional time will be allotted to discuss this process at our upcoming staff meeting). This process will continue through the remainder of the year with the goal that our entire library be converted to the new brand identity by 2024.\n\u00a0\nThank you for your help in implementing this change \u2013 we hope you\u2019re as excited as we are!\n\u00a0\nBest,\n\u00a0\nAlisa & Chuck\n\u00a0\nJacob Pieczynski\n(He/Him)\nMarketing & Communications Manager\nLCW\nWebsite\n\u00a0\n|\n\u00a0\nTwitter\n \n|\n\u00a0\nFacebook\n\u00a0\n|\n\u00a0\nLinkedIn\nView our upcoming events\n | \nSign-up for our newsletter",

We will review together on our call tomorrow, Tuesday 6/27, at 2pm CT.\u00a0\n\u00a0\nBefore reviewing the site, please see the following notes (many are regarding recent feedback):\nDownloadable resources - when a user goes to a resource, the popup will come up prompting them to put in their email. Once the user inputs their email, it unlocks the blog post. Hopefully this is an acceptable compromise.\nOther Solutions Slider - Pictures were originally clickable as well, but it was flagged as an accessibility issue. All links need to have discernible text (even if the image has alt text. Sorry we know this is not ideal)\nWe have confirmed that Poppins is being used in all titles everywhere. Some of the smaller titles are in all Caps (like on staff blocks)\n\"The image that\u2019s used in the browser tabs is elongated and looks off. Can we swap that out with a transparent background version of the ribbon that doesn\u2019t stretch? We can provide new files as needed!\"\n - It might not be best idea to make the ribbon transparent, because some people have dark mode on their browser and the ribbon will have a black background, but I changed this so it's more of a badge shape and it should look a lot better now\n\"Can you please change the scrolling boxes to match the color of the corresponding box in the SCI graphic\"\n - We can't do the exact color. Those boxes need to have a certain level of contrast in order to pass accessibility standards. So we can't make them too light.\n\"When an event is past it seems to say \u201cExpired!\u201d \u2013 is there a work around for that/what\u2019s the options post-event for these pages?\"\n - So this is how the current events work as of right now: When an event is active, there will be a button that says \"Reserve your seat\" that links to a hubspot form. When the event is expired, an LCW staff member will need to go into the event and add the link to the recording. Once that is done, it will show a button to watch a recording (blocked by a popup to capture their email address). Here is a test example: \nhttps://lcw1.wpengine.com/events/brave-conversations-with-lcw-live-lets-talk-about-why-juneteenth-matters/\n If the recording link isn't added, then the event will just say \"expired!\" with no button.\nOn the contact page, after submitting contact form, the page redirects to the bottom of the screen instead of where the success message appears - This has something to do with Hubspot forms and we can't adjust it.\nTranslations - We believe what we agreed upon is that we were going to get the translation plugin installed and set up, and LCW will have to go in and work on manually translating every webpage. When you click the different translation options, it won't work until the pages are actually translated. So maybe we just turn this feature off for now?\nAlso, please confirm that the domain is switching to \nlcwinclusion.com\n. Thanks!\n\u00a0\nLooking forward to meeting with you tomorrow.\u00a0\n\u00a0\nBest,\nMaura\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\nMaura Murphy-Barrosse\nProject Manager\nBuddy Web Design & Development\nmaura@buddywdd.com\n323-868-6083\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\nThis message may contain confidential information and is intended only for the individual named.

Executives predict that 44% of employees\u2019 skill sets may require updating by 2027. The results, published in the World Economic Forum\u2019s \nFuture of Jobs\n report, show that while tech literacy ranks among the top ten in-demand skills, soft skills such as analytical and creative thinking, self-awareness, and agility rank even higher. This reflects the need for workers to adjust to profound changes in the workplace, the report noted. [\nCNBC\n]\n\u2022\nHappy hybrid.\n Attrition rates go down by more than a third when companies use a hybrid work model, recent research has found. However, while hybrid appeals to many workers and can reduce operating expenses for organizations, it can also make networking more difficult, especially for younger workers. To improve remote workers\u2019 access to coaching and learning, companies may need to tweak their onboarding and mentoring programs. For instance, offering online onboarding could allow new employees to meet key stakeholders and establish feedback channels early on.

In an episode of \nThe\n \nMcKinsey Podcast\n, McKinsey senior partners \nDana Maor\n and\n Patrick Simon\n surveyed more than 2,500 business leaders to learn what they see as the biggest organizational changes. McKinsey\u2019s \nState of Organizations\n report reveals ten shifts affecting companies, with managing the hybrid workplace, increasing resilience, and building capabilities coming in top of mind for executives\n.\n\u2022\nStrengthening resilience. \nOur research has uncovered a wide range of organizations\u2014from smaller companies with 200 employees to larger ones with 140,000 workers, in a variety of fields\u2014that are succeeding, despite economic uncertainty. These organizations build resilience into their processes and structures by breaking down silos, communicating clear priorities to all parts of the organization, and providing upskilling opportunities for talent at all levels. \nUnderstand four ways that today\u2019s organizations can respond\n to a constantly changing business environment.\nPrepare for future shocks\n\u2014 Edited by Gwyn Herbein, editor, Atlanta\nWas this forwarded to you? \nSign up here\n.\nOr \nsend us feedback\n\u2014we\u2019d love to hear from you.\nFollow our thinking\n \nThis email contains information about McKinsey's research, insights, services, or events.

We\u2019ll take a look at your notes and consider them as we make changes after the site goes live. Here are a few quick responses to your comments:\n\u00a0\nThe four prominent boxes do not lead to a sales page; without these boxes leading me to an action I\u2019m not sure I understand their function. And from the UX perspective they seem misleading. I want to click and there is no where to go from there. I think each should have a corresponding landing page or at least lead to a sales/landing page.\nWe asked the developer about adding CTA buttons for the pop-out boxes and we\u2019ll add those after the launch. \nThere is an especially critical for our eLearnings and Microlearnings which should have a more direct sales funnel with a request to-\n Book a Demo-to\u00a0 make it easier for a customer to view and purchase the product without having to go through our Biz Dev process or work with a consultant. I think we stand to sell more if we make it easier.\nI like the concept but don\u2019t know what this looks like in practice. I\u2019d need someone to create this process and tell me what tools we\u2019re using to make it happen.\nOn the Let's Talk form- eLearning are not available in the drop down menu\nDigital Learning Solutions is included in the Services of Interest section\nPodcast page \u2013 only one podcast; how can folks access the others? Seems another missed opportunity to engage a customer\nWe have all our past podcasts on this page \u2013 can you explain what you mean by only one podcast?\nMenu bar \u2013 why is careers (especially now) on the main menu- doesn\u2019t make sense if we are being customer and sales focused\nI think the situation has certainly changed since the site structure was created, but we should remain ready for growth and can leverage the page to collect contractor info if that\u2019s the direction we change to. It\u2019s also very late in the game to make a structural change to the website layout. \nOverall I think there could be more prominent Call to Action buttons \u2013 Book a Demo-Book a Call-Meet with a Consultant- etc\nYes we\u2019ll add the buttons mentioned above to add some opportunities for acting on calls to action on the T&L page.\n\u00a0\nThank you for your time and insights!\n\u00a0\nJake\n\u00a0\nJake Pieczynski\n(he/him/his)\nMarketing & Communications Manager\nLCW \n\u00a0\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\nwww\n\u00a0\n|\n\u00a0\nTwitter\n \n|\n\u00a0\nFacebook\n\u00a0\n|\n\u00a0\nLinkedIn\n\u00a0\nFrom:\n Tamara Thorpe <\nt.thorpe@lcwmail.com\n> \nSent:\n Friday, June 23, 2023 4:49 PM\nTo:\n Jake Pieczynski <\nj.pieczynski@lcwmail.com\n>\nSubject:\n RE: Please respond by EOD Friday if interested - LCW Website Review\n\u00a0\nHello Jake,\n\u00a0\nThanks for the opportunity.
