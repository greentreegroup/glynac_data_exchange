We cannot truly stand with Indigenous Peoples without also acknowledging the struggles brought on by centuries of discrimination. According to the United Nations: \u27a1\ufe0f While Indigenous People make up less than 5% of the world\u2019s population, they represent 15% of the poorest. \u27a1\ufe0f Indigenous People are 3x as likely as non-Indigenous people to live in extreme poverty. Today and throughout the year, inclusive leaders must listen to and uplift the incredibly diverse lived experiences of Indigenous People on our journey toward equity, reconciliation, and authentic allyship. #DEI #Inclusion #Culture \nView\none person liked your LinkedIn post.\n\u00a0\n\ud83d\udc9c Since 2014, August 7th has been observed as Purple Heart Day in the United States\u2014a day to remember and honor the brave Americans who were either wounded on the battlefield or paid the ultimate sacrifice with their lives. \ud83d\udc9c Today, Veterans make up 6.4% of the United States\u2019 adult population at approximately 16.5 million people, and 30% are living with a disability. \ud83d\udc9c Our Veteran population exemplifies diversity, having sacrificed and served our country regardless of gender, race, ethnicity, religion, economic status, and the many other aspects of identity. \ud83d\udc9c It is crucial that inclusive leaders take the time to understand their lived experiences and continue to support Veterans on our journey toward building truly equitable mindsets and systems. #PurpleHeartDay #DEI #Culture \nView\n\u00a0\nGo to Inbox\n\u00a0\nUnder certain privacy laws and regulations, you must tell anyone who interacts with your connected social accounts that their data is being stored in HubSpot.

July 26 is now commemorated as #DisabilityIndependenceDay, and the month of July is recognized as #DisabilityPrideMonth. While disability rights have come a long way, there\u2019s still progress to be made in achieving truly equitable systems. According to a 2022 report from the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics: \u27a1\ufe0f Across all age groups, people with disabilities are much less likely to be employed than people without disabilities. \u27a1\ufe0f The unemployment rate for people with disabilities is about twice as high as the rate for people without disabilities. \u27a1\ufe0f 30% of workers with disabilities are employed part-time as opposed to 16% of nondisabled workers, often because their hours were reduced or they couldn\u2019t find an accessible full-time job. During July and throughout the year, we stand with the disabled community as we seek to foster equity in the communities where people live and at the organizations where they work. Only when all cultures are included can we ensure equitable outcomes and optimized performance in the workplace. #DEI #DiversityAndInclusion #Culture \nView\n2 people liked your LinkedIn post.\n\u00a0\nEvery LCW Learning Journey is grounded in four overarching competencies: \ud83d\udc49 Awareness and Knowledge \ud83d\udc49 Cultural Literacy \ud83d\udc49 Empathy & Collaboration \ud83d\udc49 Sustainable Inclusion LCW experts use Inclusive Leadership and Mitigating Bias learning journeys as a starting place to collaborate in developing a customized plan that achieves long-term, measurable results.

    "subject": "What's New at Zoom | July 2023 Recap",
    "body": "Dear Jacob,\u00a0\nWhether it's new products and features or courses that teach you to use Zoom better, we are constantly evolving to improve your experience. To help keep you up to date, we have summarized some key new things you should know below. \nDownload\n the latest version of the Zoom desktop client to access all these features and more.\u00a0\nFor more resources to help you stay up to date, check out:\u00a0\nPreview notes\n \u2013 A list of upcoming features. This page is only available to Zoom account owners and admins; you must sign in to view them.\nRelease notes\n \u2013 A complete list of past releases across the Zoom platform.\u00a0\nIf you have questions about the features and announcements outlined below, please reply directly to this email.\n*Note: Some products and features may not be available to all customers.\u00a0\nZoom Learning Center Updates \nDiscover updated Zoom Rooms courses - \nThe Zoom Learning Center team recently updated the \nZoom Rooms catalog\n\u00a0to include information on all the latest and greatest features and enhancements. Refresh your memory on Zoom Rooms features, or learn something new like how you can reserve a Zoom Room with Workspace Reservation! \nZoom Community\u00a0 \nThe \nCustomer Success Forum\n\u00a0on the Zoom Community is now live!\n Launched in 2021, the \nZoom Community\n\u00a0is a hub for users to find answers, seek support, and receive guidance from fellow Zoom users and Zoom product experts. In the new Customer Success Forum, users will find a collaborative place to share success stories, learn about upcoming events, and exchange helpful ways to use Zoom features, all in one centralized, easily accessible location. Join the forum and learn more today!\nKey Highlights from Zoom\u2019s July Releases\u00a0 \nZoom Web\n\u00a0Updates \nSet default Team Chat channels for users\n\u00a0-\n Account owners and admins can set up to 5 default Team Chat channels, to which all new and existing users will automatically be added. The chosen channels must be public channels and users can choose to leave these default channels. \nZoom Phone\n\u00a0Updates \nAdvanced encryption for voicemails -\n Once advanced encryption for Zoom Phone voicemail is enabled, voicemail messages are received and recorded by Zoom servers which encrypt them with keys only known to their intended recipients\u2019 devices. If admins enable the Escrow feature within advanced encryption for voicemails, admins will now be able to access these keys and users voicemails. Shared Line Appearance, Shared Line Group, Call Queue, or Auto Receptionist voicemail are not supported. Additionally, functionalities like email to voicemail, transcriptions, and the ability to check voicemails through dialing or the web are disabled when this feature is enabled. To utilize this feature, users must have a Power Pack license. Only admins with appropriate permissions can manage these voicemails.\nZoom Events\n\u00a0Updates \nAttendee Companion app for Zoom - \nAttendees can join hybrid events using the companion app. This app allows them to attend an event in person or virtually without leaving Zoom Events. They can find, bookmark, and attend sessions in hybrid events. Attendees can navigate the physical space using maps and digital guides and switch between in-person and virtual webinar/meeting streams. During hybrid events, attendees can connect with in-person and virtual attendees. The companion app is available for iOS and Android devices. This feature may not be immediately available, as it is dependent on a backend server update. \nSecurity questions authentication for registration\n\u00a0-\n Hosts can enable security questions for registrants when creating an event. Security questions apply to all registrants regardless of how they join (i.e., sign in to Zoom/IDP or fast join). The host can choose questions from a list of security questions (a template of 10 questions) and can customize up to 3 security questions. The questions will appear on the registration page as a mandatory item. Registrants must pick at least one question from the list and answer it to complete registration. The answer to each question will be associated with unique users, and the answer will be stored safely on the Zoom Events platform. After authentication at joining, registrants must answer the question they chose at registration. Only the registrant has the answer to the security question. If the registrant loses the answer, they will also lose access to the assigned ticket and cannot join the event. Registrants can contact the host for help and can register another ticket from the event detail page.\nZoom IQ for Sales\n\u00a0Updates \nEmail compose with Zoom IQ for Sales\n\u00a0-\n Account owners and admins can enable or disable users' option to use Zoom IQ to create follow-up emails directly from the Zoom IQ for Sales Deals page. This setting is available at the account level and is disabled by default. This feature is currently not available for users with External IQ Admin and Zoom IQ Collaborator roles. \nZoom Contact Center\n\u00a0Updates \nSupport for regions -\n Account owners and admins can create regions to organize users based on their location and apply voice routing settings specific to each location. This feature must be enabled by Zoom. \nAuto answer with queue default greeting - \nAccount owners and admins can improve the call handling efficiency by implementing the auto answer feature for voice engagements. With auto answer, agents can automatically connect with callers, reducing the number of clicks required and providing a standardized caller experience. It also eliminates the need for agents to repeat the same greeting on every engagement, ensuring consistent greetings. \nVideo channel for integrations -\n The Zendesk and Salesforce integrations for Zoom Contact Center support the video channel. As a result, agents can receive incoming video engagements, make outbound video calls, upgrade a voice call to video call, and chat with the consumer using in-video chat during the video engagement within the integration. During an incoming/outbound video engagement, the agent can see the customer screen pop within the CRM based on the 'email address' match. Configuration settings have been updated with video channel settings for Screen pop and search settings.\u00a0 \nWorkspace Reservation\n\u00a0Updates \nWorkspaces admin management of reservations - \nAdmins can add, change, or delete reservations at the building level. They can also override users' reservations in the building. Admins can book a workspace for a user (without needing to set up delegation), change a current workspace reservation of a user, and delete a user's current reservation. The user will receive a\u00a0 notification if a change was made to the reservation by an admin. \nConfigure a permanent desk -\n Account owners and admins can assign a user a permanent desk. Permanent desks are not reservable and will always display the assigned user at that desk. This feature displays users, who come into the office every day, and their permanent desks on the floor map. \nBusiness Announcements \nZoom Software Lifecycle Policy -\n We plan to enforce the fourth round of our Software Lifecycle Policy on August 5, 2023, for all products and services, starting with the minimum versions referenced in the table found \nhere\n. Users running an end-of-life version after August 5 will not be able to join meetings via the Zoom Client and will be prompted to update or join from the Web browser. As always, we highly recommend you regularly download and update to the latest version of Zoom software by checking for updates within the Zoom desktop client or by navigating to \nzoom.us/download\n to take advantage of all our latest security and functionality features. Note: The end-of-life enforcement for Zoom Room Controllers on Windows UWP has been extended to August 5, 2023.\u00a0 \nEnd of Life for JSON Web Token (JWT) App Type in Zoom Marketplace -\n As a reminder, Zoom disabled the ability to create new JWT apps on June 1, 2023. Developers have until September 1, 2023 to migrate their JWT-based solutions to the new Server-to-Server OAuth or OAuth app types. For more information, please see the \nJWT migration guide\n\u00a0and \nJWT deprecation FAQ\n. \nHappy Zooming,\nZoom Success Advisor\nClick \nhere\n to unsubscribe from this list or manage your preferences \nhere\n.",

    "body": "Content marketing has been the central pillar of marketing for years, but it no longer works the way most understand it.\n \n \nHi Jacob!\n\u00a0\nI talk with a lot of marketers. What do the smartest marketers understand that the rest don't? They understand that content marketing as we\u2019ve known it no longer works.\n\u00a0\nContent marketing has been the central pillar of marketing online for the last 10+ years. Write a blog post, optimize it for search, promote it everywhere, and watch the platforms send you traffic.\n\u00a0\nThat recipe no longer works, and it hasn\u2019t for some time. Organic traffic is down, ad costs are up, email is failing.\u00a0 And yet so many marketers keep going back to this playbook like it\u2019s 2010.\n\u00a0\nThe reason content marketing as we\u2019ve known it no longer works has to do with the platforms \u2014 I\u2019m talking about Google, Facebook, Linkedin, Twitter, Reddit, TikTok, etc.\n\u00a0\nBeginning some years back, the platforms shifted from driving traffic to our websites (or being benign about it) to actively focusing on keeping it for themselves, on their platforms.\u00a0\n\u00a0\nThis is the natural cycle of all platforms: Early in life they start out open and flexible (benign), but as they gain size and maturity, they start building walls to protect and sustain their value.\n\u00a0\nSo what do the smartest marketers know? And how have they adjusted?\n\u00a0\nFirstly, they know that the platforms aren\u2019t fully walled off; they\u2019ve just restricted the exits more than they have in the past.\n\u00a0\nThe platforms don\u2019t like users leaving, plain and simple. They want us to stay on their platform and they\u2019ll do everything in their power to make that happen.\n\u00a0\nSo if you can\u2019t get the platforms to drive you traffic, how do you get the attention of the people you want to be talking with?\n\u00a0\nThrough engagement and distribution. This is the new paradigm.\u00a0\u00a0\n\u00a0\nENGAGEMENT: POSTING CONTENT THAT LIVES ON THE PLATFORM\n\u00a0\nForget about blog posts on your site (they\u2019re still relevant, but in a different way). The key to driving engagement is posting content that people want to consume ON the platforms.\n\u00a0\nI\u2019ve heard this referred to as zero-click marketing, which I like; however, I don\u2019t think it\u2019s a term many are familiar with yet. But it gets the concept across.\n\u00a0\nWhat content can be consumed on a platform? A video, an image/collection of photos, a written post, a survey, an audiogram, etc.\n\u00a0\nNot only is on-platform content easier for a person to consume (you don\u2019t need to leave Linkedin to read this post), but the platform also prioritizes these types of posts.\n\u00a0\nSaid differently, content that keeps users on a platform gets exposed to more members of that platform than content that would send those people away from the platform.\n\u00a0\nThat\u2019s literally how platform algorithms are designed: reward stuff that keeps people on the platform, and discount stuff that leads people away.\u00a0\u00a0\n\u00a0\nWhich brings us to the second component of this new paradigm: how to reach the maximum number of people on these platforms, which is all about distribution.\n\u00a0\nDISTRIBUTION: ACHIEVING MAX EXPOSURE OF YOUR CONTENT\n\u00a0\nAssuming you post content that meets the above criteria (something that can be consumed on a platform), how do you get it exposed to the MOST people?\n\u00a0\nIn my experience, distribution is something that marketers aren\u2019t very good at. They focus a great deal on the content and on production, but distribution gets short shrift.\n\u00a0\nThat\u2019s a giant mistake.\n\u00a0\nDistribution is how you derive value from the content you create, and, in this new paradigm you need new ways to reach people because the platforms aren\u2019t going to send them your way.\n\u00a0\nYes, you could publish this content to your brand page, but no one is going to see it unless you pay to promote it.\u00a0\n\u00a0\nYou could run some ads to promote your posts, but again, we\u2019re back to spending money, and ads are fundamentally unsustainable, especially in B2B.\n\u00a0\nThe KEY to distribution is getting people to share it to their networks, and the people you have ready access to are your employees: your CEO, the interns, and everyone in between.\n\u00a0\nYou already understand why the type of content is important: It\u2019s got to be something that 1) the platform prioritizes and 2) that users want to engage with. Check.\n\u00a0\nWell, WHO posts the content also matters. The #1 thing platforms want are users and the #1 type of user a network wants is a user who contributes CONTENT to their platform.\u00a0\u00a0\n\u00a0\nThese content-contributing users are the users who keep all of the other users coming back and they\u2019re SUPER rare \u2014 there\u2019s only one for every 100 average users.\u00a0\u00a0\n\u00a0\nCase in point: You wouldn\u2019t be here if I and X number of other people didn\u2019t post to this platform! I\u2019m not saying this is the world's best post. It\u2019s not, but you get the point.\n\u00a0\nEmployees are users in the eyes of a platform, which means the content they post \u2014 assuming it meets the above criteria \u2014 will be distributed to the broadest possible audience.\n\u00a0\nAnd, of course, the more of your people you get to distribute your content, the greater the number of people it will be exposed to. But marketing has always been a numbers game.\n\u00a0\nSo yes, content marketing as we\u2019ve known it is dead, but the simpler reality is that the rules have just changed.\n\u00a0\nBut when the rules change, when people are caught off guard, when they don\u2019t even see the ground shifting underneath them, THAT\u2019S when the opportunity is the greatest.\u00a0\u00a0\n\u00a0\nAnd this is what the smartest marketers know: They\u2019re sourcing content to drive engagement and leveraging their people to distribute it.\n\u00a0\nThanks for reading, and I hope you have a wonderful weekend!\n\u00a0\nBest,\n\u00a0\nCameron Brain\u00a0\nCEO & Co-Founder\nEveryoneSocial\n\u00a0\nP.S. - Feel free to connect with me on \nLinkedIn\n or \nTwitter\n!\nMake sure to follow us on social media!\n \n \n \n \nEveryoneSocial, 215 W Sego Lily Dr., #708100, Sandy, Utah 84070, United States \nUnsubscribe\n \nManage preferences",

TOMORROW\u2019S INSIGHTS.\nA daily newsletter from McKinsey & Company\nBrought to you by \nLiz Hilton Segel\n, chief client officer and managing partner, global industry practices, &\u00a0\nHomayoun Hatami\n, managing partner, global client capabilities\nBooks for summer reading\nIn the news\n\u2022\nTake it easy.\n Although humans often dream of a life of leisure, it\u2019s been the norm to work 40 hours a week since the 1990s. With the acceleration of AI, people increasingly speculate about whether machines will totally replace human labor\u2014but could society actually handle that? Present-day workers seem uncomfortable with relaxing, using leisure time to pursue goals. That hasn\u2019t always been the case. In 17th-century England, knitters routinely skipped work to go to \u201cthe alehouse or nine-pins,\u201d a Royal Society fellow complained. Perhaps a more leisurely life of rest is needed. [\nFT\n]\n\u2022\nLow levels of reading.\n Nearly a third of American students spend very little or no time reading for pleasure, and the average 13-year-old\u2019s reading scores have fallen to their lowest level in about two decades, according to a recent National Assessment of Educational Progress report. Experts point to technology and social media as among the largest factors that may be contributing to a lack of reading. The average age that a child gets their first mobile phone is now 11, a 2022 Stanford Medicine study revealed. That\u2019s an age where reading is normally encouraged. [\nThe Hill\n]\nPerhaps as a sign of much-needed respite, the most popular genre this year was fiction and poetry.\nOn McKinsey.com\n\u2022\nWhat to read.\n Our world is both concerning\u2014with executives navigating geopolitical tensions, economic setbacks, and other challenges\u2014and exciting, with the advent of generative AI, which promises to shift the way we work. Our annual summer reading list reflects today\u2019s evolving times, with selections by leaders from around the world, including picks from McKinsey global managing partner \nBob Sternfels\n, chief marketing officer \nTracy Francis\n, managing partner of global client capabilities \nHomayoun Hatami\n, and senior partner \nRodney Zemmel\n. We also provide 11 additional curated reading lists\n.\n\u2022\nSomething for everyone.\n Out of more than 70 selections, the top two books CEOs, founders, and editors recommended for \nMcKinsey\u2019s 2023 summer reading guide\n were \nThe Age of AI: And Our Human Future\n\u2014by Daniel Huttenlocher, Henry A. Kissinger, and Eric Schmidt\u2014and \nTrust\n by Hernan Diaz. These are from our innovation and fiction and poetry genres, respectively. In addition to these genres, with this year\u2019s list, you\u2019ll find books across genres such as workplace culture, history, personal development, biography and memoir, and more\n.\nEnjoy our annual book list\n\u2014 Edited by Vanessa Burke, editor, Atlanta\nWas this forwarded to you? \nSign up here\n.\nOr \nsend us feedback\n\u2014we\u2019d love to hear from you.\nFollow our thinking\n \nThis email contains information about McKinsey's research, insights, services, or events.

TOMORROW\u2019S INSIGHTS.\nA daily newsletter from McKinsey & Company\nBrought to you by \nLiz Hilton Segel\n, chief client officer and managing partner, global industry practices, &\u00a0\nHomayoun Hatami\n, managing partner, global client capabilities\nSearing heat in India\nIn the news\n\u2022\nA deadly threat.\n Rising temperatures significantly threaten the physical and economic health of women and girls around the world. As a result of extreme heat, by 2050, more than 200,000 women in India, Nigeria, and the United States could die each year, new research by the Atlantic Council finds. Excessive heat restricts women\u2019s working hours, resulting in a loss of income. The poorest women\u2014such as West Bengal bricklayers who work outdoors and perform arduous physical labor\u2014are often the most affected. [\nAtlantic Council\n]\n\u2022\nLacking air-conditioning.\n As record-high temperatures are being recorded across the globe, women are disproportionately exposed to health and financial risks. Extreme heat in India, Nigeria, and the United States limits women\u2019s capacity for paid labor, amounting to $120 billion in lost productivity each year. Women who perform domestic chores, including collecting water for cleaning and cooking, are especially vulnerable to scorching temperatures. Just 9% of women\u2019s working hours in India occur in air-conditioned workplaces. [\nScientific American\n]\nWe estimate that 160 million to 200 million people could be living in urban areas in India with a nonzero annual probability of experiencing a lethal heatwave as soon as 2030.\nOn McKinsey.com\n\u2022\nClimate risk challenges.\n As India faces a rapidly changing physical environment, extreme heat and humidity could put millions of lives and billions of dollars at risk. In fact, India could become one of the world\u2019s first places to experience heat waves that exceed what a healthy human resting in the shade could survive, McKinsey Global Institute director \nJonathan Woetzel\n and coauthors explain. Rising heat and humidity levels will also affect labor productivity and economic growth in an economy that relies substantially on outdoor work\n.\n\u2022\nWhat extreme heat costs.\n Chronic exposure to extreme heat rapidly decreases people\u2019s ability to perform outdoor work. In India, the number of daylight hours during which outdoor work is unsafe will increase approximately 15% by 2030, compared with today\u2019s levels, McKinsey analysis reveals. Lost labor hours due to increasing heat and humidity levels could put roughly 2.5 to 4.5% of GDP at risk by 2030, equivalent to roughly $150 billion to $250 billion. See what it would take \nfor India to address the risk of lethal heat waves\n.\nUnderstand climate risk in India\n\u2014 Edited by Belinda Yu, editor, Atlanta\nWas this forwarded to you? \nSign up here\n.\nOr \nsend us feedback\n\u2014we\u2019d love to hear from you.\nFollow our thinking\n \nThis email contains information about McKinsey's research, insights, services, or events.

TOMORROW\u2019S INSIGHTS.\nA daily newsletter from McKinsey & Company\nBrought to you by \nLiz Hilton Segel\n, chief client officer and managing partner, global industry practices, &\u00a0\nHomayoun Hatami\n, managing partner, global client capabilities\nPlaying it (psychologically) safe\nIn the news\n\u2022\nToo much of a good thing.\n The Great Resignation of the pandemic years\u2014government data shows roughly 98 million people left their jobs in 2021 and 2022\u2014shone a light on toxic work cultures. But an insincere brand of niceness doesn\u2019t actually fix toxicity, which is generally defined as environments that are not inclusive. According to psychology professor and author Tessa West, too much niceness doesn\u2019t equate to empathy and can prevent managers from giving the critical feedback that helps people grow. [\nFortune\n]\n\u2022\nUnder pressure.\n One organization estimates that anxiety and depression cost 12 billion working days, to the tune of $1 trillion in lost productivity across the globe each year. Organizations have committed everything from apps, free therapy, and assistance hotlines to help employees, but many workers are still stressed by their jobs. If the problem exists at an organization-wide level, then training programs will do little to help, one CEO says. Even if these initiatives survive postpandemic, they might not be accompanied by strategies to address unmanageable workloads, which may increase as persistent labor issues reduce staff. [\nFT\n]\nAccording to one McKinsey survey, an overwhelming 89% of employee respondents said they believe that psychological safety in the workplace is essential.\nOn McKinsey.com\n\u2022\nThe power of psychological safety.\n Social scientists consider psychological safety\u2014feeling free to openly disagree and bring up concerns without fear of retaliation\u2014a basic need that\u2019s vital to personal well-being. Research reveals that psychological safety at work strongly predicts team performance, productivity, and quality\u2014and is even connected with better overall health. Open lines of feedback and communication can cultivate more creativity and inclusivity. According to a survey led by McKinsey senior partner \nAaron De Smet\n and colleagues, leaders can promote this environment by engaging in supportive, collaborative behaviors such as open-dialogue skills.\n\u2022\nDeveloping inclusive leaders.\n Creating psychological safety in the workplace requires an investment in developing empathetic and compassionate leaders. Organizations can formalize a commitment to psychological safety by reducing the stigma around mental health, offering leadership training that goes beyond a one-off presentation, and incorporating skill development into leaders\u2019 daily work.

TOMORROW\u2019S INSIGHTS.\nA daily newsletter from McKinsey & Company\nBrought to you by \nLiz Hilton Segel\n, chief client officer and managing partner, global industry practices, &\u00a0\nHomayoun Hatami\n, managing partner, global client capabilities\nThe rise of generative AI\nIn the news\n\u2022\nCustom credit cards.\n Although generative-AI tools have clearly captured the world's attention, finance leaders have been using computers to automate banking for decades, starting with ATMs in the 1970s. Still, generative AI represents a breakthrough in the development of artificial intelligence. Generative AI\u2019s ability to use training data to create new content could give financial institutions the capacity to personalize products for every consumer. Banks might, for example, offer credit cards with financial perks that factor in how frequently someone orders takeout or travels for work. [\nFortune\n]\n\u2022\nThe AI-enabled accountant.\n Companies\u2019 finance and accounting departments are filled with routine activities. Now, CFOs are exploring the potential of generative AI to automate tasks even as organizations are trimming costs and dealing with a shortage of accountants. By producing lengthy reports and presentations, generative AI could remove much of the typical work for auditors and accountants. That might allow finance professionals to play a greater role in decision making, which in turn may spark more interest in these careers. [\nWSJ\n]\nAbout 75% of the value that generative-AI use cases could deliver falls across customer operations, marketing and sales, software engineering, and R&D.\nOn McKinsey.com\n\u2022\nProductivity boost.\n As companies rush to adapt and implement generative AI, understanding its potential to deliver value to the economy and society will help shape critical decisions about the technology. Generative AI\u2019s impact on productivity could add trillions of dollars in value to the global economy. Our latest research estimates that generative AI may add the equivalent of $2.6 trillion to $4.4 trillion annually across 63 use cases, McKinsey senior partner \nLareina Yee\n and coauthors explain.\n\u2022\nTransforming knowledge work. \nGenerative AI is likely to have the biggest effect on knowledge work, particularly activities involving decision making and collaboration. The capacity to automate activities that require applying expertise has increased to 58.5% in 2023, from 24.5% in 2017, while the ability to automate managing and developing talent jumped to 49.0% in 2023, from 15.5% in 2017, McKinsey estimates show. \nConsider how leaders may use generative AI to potentially create value\n, streamline processes, and augment employee performance.\n\ufeffSee what generative AI could do\n\u2014 Edited by Belinda Yu, editor, Atlanta\nWas this forwarded to you? \nSign up here\n.\nOr \nsend us feedback\n\u2014we\u2019d love to hear from you.\nFollow our thinking\n \nThis email contains information about McKinsey's research, insights, services, or events.

TOMORROW\u2019S INSIGHTS.\nA daily newsletter from McKinsey & Company\n \nBrought to you by \nLiz Hilton Segel\n, chief client officer and managing partner, global industry practices, &\u00a0\nHomayoun Hatami\n, managing partner, global client capabilities\nStepping down smoothly as a CEO\nIn the news\n\u2022\nRecord turnover.\n It\u2019s been a rough year for US businesses, with leaders contending with elevated inflation, the threat of recession, skills shortages, and disruptive technologies such as AI. In May 2023, monthly CEO turnover in the US reached an all-time high, with 224 chief executives departing their jobs, an executive outplacement company has found. That\u2019s a 52% increase from April 2023 and the biggest number of CEOs leaving in one month since 2002, when the company started collecting these data. [\nFortune\n]\n\u2022\nLeadership legitimacy.\n The role of CEO carries great authority. Yet newly appointed executives who rely solely on authority to lead can only partly inspire. Displaying competence is a deeper way to influence, but workers\u2019 support may rise or fall depending on a leader\u2019s performance. New CEOs who gain legitimacy, however, earn the perceived right to lead in the best and worst of times. By acting with integrity, particularly when that comes at a cost\u2014for instance, recalling a dangerous item immediately\u2014leaders earn the trust of employees. [\nHBR\n]\nA new CEO\u2019s early dismissal is 2.4 times more likely when the outgoing CEO remains the board chair.\nOn McKinsey.com\n\u2022\n\ufeffWhat bad transitions cost.\n When you\u2019re a celebrated CEO, it\u2019s hard to imagine being unprepared at the end of your career, McKinsey senior partner \nCarolyn Dewar\n and coauthors share. But as the transition to a new CEO gets closer, the reality that you\u2019ve never done this before can feel daunting. Unlike Olympic athletes who practice over and over, you\u2019ll only have one very public shot at it, and under emotional strain. Poorly managed C-suite transitions wipe out close to $1 trillion in market value every year in S&P 1500 companies\n.\n\u2022\nBetter CEO handoffs.\n In a successful relay, the person receiving the baton starts running well before the baton reaches them. The best chief executives work with their directors on succession planning throughout their tenure. For instance, former Intuit CEO Brad Smith spoke to his board every quarter to update them on his succession plan. This helped to ensure there were no surprises when the time came to transition to a new CEO, Smith explains.

As you settle in and unwind, catch up on digital transformations in the age of AI, the future of the hospitality industry, creating new market solutions without disrupting existing industries, and more.\n \nAre you rewired to win? The latest \nFive Fifty\n from \nMcKinsey Quarterly\n shows why digital transformations are more important than ever in the age of generative AI.\nUnlock the power of AI\n \nWhat will staying at a hotel be like in 2030? See how the hospitality industry will evolve to benefit travelers, workers, and the environment in McKinsey\u2019s \nThe Next Normal\n series.\nCheck into the hotel of the future\n \nIn a new \nAuthor Talks\n interview, professor Ren\u00e9e Mauborgne talks to McKinsey\u2019s Elissa Bandler about how companies can innovate without disrupting industries or displacing jobs.\nPush the boundaries\n \nOur weekly briefing note on sustainable and inclusive growth explores how technological advancements in bioengineering and shared-mobility solutions are helping to solve global challenges.\nGet updated\nTECH FOR EXECS\n \nThe rise and rise of Python\nWelcome to Tech for Execs: quick primers on technology concepts to get business leaders up to speed.\nWhy do people choose Python?\n \nIt\u2019s a go-to language\n for back-end development, software, data science, and machine learning. It\u2019s easy to learn and integrates with other languages\u2014so it can find its place within pre-existing architectures without too much trouble.\nWhat are the biggest benefits?\n Python is great for creating automated processes, which save time. Its popularity means there are thousands of existing packages\u2014ready-to-use \u2018chunks\u2019 of code\u2014out there. And it\u2019s easy to read and debug, and therefore it\u2019s simple to fix if something does go wrong.\nHow are organizations using Python?\n It\u2019s \nparticularly popular for data science applications\n. At McKinsey, we used Python in our work with a healthcare organization to help \nimprove COVID-19 capacity modelling\n. Because when you\u2019re dealing with complex data lakes and working at speed, simplicity is a virtue.\nDo my developers know how to use Python?\n There\u2019s a good chance they do\u2014it\u2019s one of the more popular languages available. Even if they don\u2019t, experienced developers can usually pick the language up quickly.\nIf we start using Python, does that mean starting over?\n Not necessarily\u2014Python plays well with other languages. Plus, there\u2019s no shortage of packages and frameworks out there to accelerate your work. One example is \nKedro, McKinsey\u2019s open-source framework\n, which simplifies and standardizes data science coding.\nQUOTE OF THE DAY\n\u201cChildren need to have family time. They need to be able to talk with their parents, have hobbies, and eat dinner together. These types of things are so important, more important than a worksheet\u2014and that\u2019s coming from a former teacher.\u201d\n\u2014\nJamie Sears\n, founder and CEO of Not So Wimpy Teacher, on how we should be thinking differently about homework, in a \nrecent \nAuthor Talks\n interview\nchart of the day\n \nSee today\u2019s chart\nReady to unwind?\nWhat is space junk?\nSpace junk refers to fragments left behind in space. Consisting mostly of rocket-launching material and disused satellites, this debris can make space travel and exploration more challenging.\nFind out what\u2019s in orbit\n\u00a0\nData Points: Your weekly quiz\nHow well do you know the numbers behind the changes in business, society, and the world?

TOMORROW\u2019S INSIGHTS.\nA daily newsletter from McKinsey & Company\n \nBrought to you by \nLiz Hilton Segel\n, chief client officer and managing partner, global industry practices, &\u00a0\nHomayoun Hatami\n, managing partner, global client capabilities\nTransformational technologies\nIn the news\n\u2022\nPrivacy concerns.\n Employers are certain that generative-AI platforms could boost workers\u2019 productivity. What they are less sure of is whether the technology would expose confidential information to rivals or bad actors. Executives are therefore worried about both \u201cmissing out\u201d on and \u201cmessing up\u201d the generative-AI opportunity, says the head of one law firm\u2019s machine learning practice. In February 2023, a telecom company became one of a handful of large US employers to ban or limit using generative AI at work. [\nWaPo\n]\n\u2022\nGeographic winners.\n From the rise of personal computing to the birth of social media, Silicon Valley\u2019s influence over the global tech sector has lasted decades. The generative-AI boom could strengthen the region\u2019s dominance in technology. One in four generative-AI jobs in the past year were listed in the Bay Area, per a Brookings Institution analysis of about 2,200 job postings in roughly 380 US metro areas. Hubs that become early tech adopters often long benefit from the financial assets and skilled workforces associated with those technologies. [\nNYT\n]\nIn the coming decade, 20 to 30% of the time that workers spend on the job could be transformed by automation technologies.\nOn McKinsey.com\n\u2022\nAI\u2019s next frontier.\n After a tough year for tech talent and investment in 2022, enthusiasm for technology is growing. To help leaders track the latest developments, the McKinsey Technology Council\u2014including chair \nLareina Yee\n and coauthors\u2014identified 15 of the most significant tech trends. Last year\u2019s 14 trends remain relevant. One new trend, generative AI, could add as much as $4.4 trillion in economic value annually. Even so, generative AI is just one of many advances that could propel growth and solve complex challenges\n.\n\u2022\nSearch for skills.\n Between technology\u2019s potential to add value and organizations\u2019 ability to realize growth lies the great gulf of talent. Many of the most in-demand skills for these tech trends have less than half as many qualified practitioners per posting as the global average, our survey of 3.5 million job postings reveals. Companies should be ready to respond to shifts in the talent market (such as recent layoffs in the tech sector) and continue to look at how they can adjust roles and upskill workers.

    "body": "At WP Engine, serving you is our purpose, and we are focused on the continuous delivery of that value. We appreciate you trusting your sites and digital presence to WP Engine. We are writing to inform you of important updates regarding PHP. \nPHP 7.4 Extended Security Support:\n \nWP Engine is pleased to announce that we will continue to invest in ongoing security support of PHP 7.4 through 2024, as WordPress and a wide range of themes and plugins are still not fully compatible with PHP 8.0+, which could lead to critical errors on some websites. \nPHP 8.0 End-of-Life:\nPHP 8.0 will reach end-of-life (EOL) and no longer receive security support by the end of the year. In response to this, \nWP Engine will begin the EOL process for PHP 8.0, which means PHP 8.0 will no longer be available on the WP Engine platform by November 2023. \nWP Engine will perform automatic upgrades of all sites still on PHP 8.0 to PHP 8.2 before November and will communicate more specific dates in the coming weeks. You can read more about the upgrade process \nhere \n. \nWhat does this mean for you?\n \nWe encourage you to take advantage of PHP 8.2 now - there is no need to wait for your automatic upgrade. PHP 8.2 is a minor version change and a significantly easier upgrade process. Our recommendation is to use our \nPHP Test Driver \n, which allows you to preview your site on PHP 8.2, without impacting the live content your visitors see.\nAfter using the PHP Test Driver to verify your website is functioning as expected, please use our \nPHP Selector \nin the User Portal to perform your upgrade. It's that simple! \nOur team of WordPress experts are available 24/7 to assist with any questions you may have. Thank you for the opportunity to serve your business. \nNeed help? \nContact our \nSupport Team \n. \n\u00a9 WP Engine | 504 Lavaca St. Suite 1000 | Austin, TX 78701 \nNot the right contact for this account?

TOMORROW\u2019S INSIGHTS.\nA daily newsletter from McKinsey & Company\n \nBrought to you by \nLiz Hilton Segel\n, chief client officer and managing partner, global industry practices, &\u00a0\nHomayoun Hatami\n, managing partner, global client capabilities\nMotivating middle managers\nIn the news\n\u2022\nRedefining a role.\n Effective middle managers help companies survive disruption while retaining talent. But without a clearly defined role, they may burn out or default to individual-contributor work rather than leadership work. If that happens, people development could deteriorate. Allowing frontline managers a place in critical decision making could increase their engagement, according to a talent expert. Removing organizational bureaucracy may also help middle managers and their teams thrive. [\nFast Company\n]\n\u2022\nTight squeeze.\n Middle managers face a tricky balance between carrying out leadership\u2019s directives or implementing new policies and motivating their direct reports. What people want from work (development in addition to flexibility and higher pay) has changed, but managers often don\u2019t have the training or time to deliver these requests. A 2022 study of 20,000 workers found that more than 50% of managers identified as burned out. Executives who provide feedback in the form of coaching\u2014rather than demands\u2014can help managers feel more supported, a senior leader says. [\nFT\n]\nIf a person is passionate about their job, then let them stay where they are.\nOn McKinsey.com\n\u2022\nThe heart of it all.\n Management hierarchies\u2014climbing the ladder through a series of linear promotions\u2014might not appeal to everyone. Not every individual contributor wants to manage people, and not every middle manager desires a corner office. Think of middle managers as the connective tissue between tasks and the people who execute them. Organizations lose valuable employees when they get promoted to positions they don\u2019t enjoy, according to McKinsey partner \nEmily Field\n and colleagues (authors of the new book, \ufeff\nPower to the Middle: Why Managers Hold the Keys to the Future of Work\n).\n\u2022\nRethink promotions. \nMany companies are still in the dark about how to promote top performers while keeping them in the same role. Effective organizations, however, recognize the need to reward inspiring middle managers without drastically changing what they love about their jobs. This model works in the trades, where apprentices eventually become masters in their field. Some companies also allow people in technical roles to take a technical-career track, rather than appointing them to lead a team. \nLearn how to retain superstar middle managers\n without promoting them out of the roles that energize them.\nReward managers the right way\n\u2014 Edited by Gwyn Herbein, editor, Atlanta\nWas this forwarded to you? \nSign up here\n.\nOr \nsend us feedback\n\u2014we\u2019d love to hear from you.\nFollow our thinking\n \nThis email contains information about McKinsey's research, insights, services, or events.

TOMORROW\u2019S INSIGHTS.\nA daily newsletter from McKinsey & Company\n \nBrought to you by \nLiz Hilton Segel\n, chief client officer and managing partner, global industry practices, &\u00a0\nHomayoun Hatami\n, managing partner, global client capabilities\n\ufeffThe state of US consumers\nIn the news\n\u2022\nPinching pennies.\n US consumers are reining in spending on personal-hygiene products, and that includes everyday basics. From June 2022 to June 2023, consumers bought 3 to 4% fewer units of laundry detergent, toilet paper, and toothpaste, according to the consumer intelligence company NIQ. As shoppers trade down to cheaper brands and products, that could spell pain for retailers and consumer-focused companies that are accustomed to raising prices to cover higher costs. [\nBloomberg\n]\n\u2022\nSummer getaway.\n Travel fares are falling sharply in the US leisure industry, a welcome sign for government officials hoping to cool down inflation without tipping the economy into recession. Airline ticket prices dropped 19% from June 2022 to June 2023, while car rental rates decreased 12%, according to US government data. Demand for travel is still going strong. Roughly six in ten consumers have already traveled for leisure or are planning to do so in 2023, a recent survey of nearly 3,700 US adults found. [\nNBC\n]\n\ufeffFor the first time since the pandemic, the change in real year-over-year spending entered negative territory across all age and income groups.\nOn McKinsey.com\n\u2022\nSpending stalls.\n As we head into the summer months, temperatures may be rising across America, but consumer spending is heading in the opposite direction, McKinsey partner \nKari Alldredge\n and coauthors reveal. In fact, across all age and income groups, consumer spending (as measured by credit card expenditures) is lower than it was a year ago. Although the rate of decline was relatively consistent across demographic groups, low-income consumers showed the steepest drop in spending, at \u20134.5%.\n\u2022\nUrge to splurge.\n In April 2023, at least half of Gen Zers and millennials in every income group said that they were planning to splurge. But consumers don\u2019t always do what they intend: real year-over-year spending fell across all income groups that month. Still, some categories seem to be benefiting from the intent to spend freely. Travel was a top category for consumers wanting to splurge in the second quarter of 2023, and travel saw 2% real year-over-year spending growth in April.

Much like a relay race, the goal of the handover is to ensure that the next person is well positioned to perform even better after the baton is handed off. Based on interviews with some of the world\u2019s most well-known chief executives, McKinsey senior partners \nCarolyn Dewar\n, \nScott Keller\n, \nVikram Malhotra\n, and \nKurt Strovink\n suggest four best practices for CEOs who are thinking about the end game: deciding when to go, finishing the job of succession planning, ensuring a clean handoff to the successor, and embracing what\u2019s next. Check out the new \nMcKinsey Quarterly\n article\n and see what it takes to achieve a gold-medal-worthy finish to your CEO tenure.\n \nSending it forward: Successfully transitioning out of the CEO role\nGreat CEOs know that the transition to their successor will define their legacy and cement the strength of what they\u2019ve built.

TOMORROW\u2019S INSIGHTS.\nA daily newsletter from McKinsey & Company\n \nBrought to you by \nLiz Hilton Segel\n, chief client officer and managing partner, global industry practices, &\u00a0\nHomayoun Hatami\n, managing partner, global client capabilities\nTransform HR for better tech talent\nIn the news\n\u2022\nNeeded: new AI skills.\n AI adoption has renewed interest in established IT skills, but it also requires entirely new ones. Prompt engineers, AI compliance specialists, and AI ethics advisers are roles that didn\u2019t exist until very recently, and there is even demand to add AI-focused roles in the C-suite. Also needed: new security jobs, thanks in part to \u201cshadow IT\u201d\u2014employees\u2019 unapproved use of AI\u2014which exposes companies to new risks. Experts say two elements will set employees up to meet companies\u2019 needs: organizational knowledge, to understand what technologies companies actually require, and a commitment to continuous learning. [\nCIO\n]\n\u2022\nCourting tech talent.\n Following layoffs as well as a 33% decrease in job openings in the tech industry in the first three months of 2023, government agencies and a wide range of other employers, including hoteliers, financial institutions, and railroad companies, are snapping up tech workers who were once eager to work only for tech giants. Yet overall, there is still stiff competition for tech talent: the unemployment rate among American tech workers is just 2%. [\nAP\n]\n\ufeffMcKinsey\u2019s research and experience in the tech talent field show that the top 25 to 50 most critical roles can create the bulk of a company\u2019s potential value.\nOn McKinsey.com\n\u2022\nAnother company\u2019s gain. \nUnlike tech companies, incumbent organizations in other industries have historically had trouble attracting the tech talent they need. This year\u2019s tech industry layoffs create an opportunity for traditional players: McKinsey analysis from the first half of 2023 finds that more than 80% of laid-off tech workers find new jobs within three months, often with nontech companies. An end-to-end approach to HR can help attract\u2014and just as important, retain\u2014tech talent at these organizations, reveal McKinsey senior partner \nDana Maor\n and coauthors.\ufeff\n\u2022\nHR can get you far.\n A holistic HR approach looks at three S\u2019s for improving a company\u2019s tech workforce. For \nsourcing\n, identify the roles that create the most value and the skills needed for them, and search beyond the usual suspects both inside and outside the organization. \nSupport\n the hiring and onboarding processes with digital tools, and then \nscale\n technology expertise by using digital tools to meet employees\u2019 development needs. See how HR teams in banking, consumer goods, and other industries are improving their ability \nto recruit and retain top tech talent\n.\nUpdate HR processes\n\u2014 Edited by Heather Hanselman, editor, Atlanta\nWas this forwarded to you? \nSign up here\n.\nOr \nsend us feedback\n\u2014we\u2019d love to hear from you.\nFollow our thinking\n \nThis email contains information about McKinsey's research, insights, services, or events.

TOMORROW\u2019S INSIGHTS.\nA daily newsletter from McKinsey & Company\n \nBrought to you by \nLiz Hilton Segel\n, chief client officer and managing partner, global industry practices, &\u00a0\nHomayoun Hatami\n, managing partner, global client capabilities\nGenerative AI for CIOs and CTOs\ufeff\nIn the news\n\u2022\nNew software.\n With many businesses ready to embrace generative AI, tech companies are capitalizing on the moment. In recent months, multiple US tech corporations have announced the development of a suite of AI tools that will be able to take meeting minutes, evaluate written materials, and generate code. In June 2023, a San Francisco\u2013based cloud computing leader debuted an enterprise software package that offers nine generative-AI-based services. The company charges clients $360,000 per year, on the low end, to use its product. [\nNYT\n]\n\u2022\nWho\u2019s in charge.\n For organizations experimenting with generative AI, one question looms large: Who is responsible for leading the way? The technology\u2019s potential to transform processes throughout a company makes it tough to decide, executives explain. Some leaders are enlisting chief technology officers (CTOs) to prioritize AI projects, while others are establishing task forces and new AI-related roles. Earlier in 2023, a US tech company formed a ten-member AI council that includes staffers from its engineering, legal, and marketing divisions. [\nWSJ\ufeff\n]\nMcKinsey research shows generative AI can lift productivity for certain marketing use cases by roughly 10% and customer support by up to 40%.\nOn McKinsey.com\n\u2022\nTrillions at stake.\n With its potential to add $2.6 trillion to $4.4 trillion of value annually, the business world\u2019s excitement over generative AI seems well earned, McKinsey senior partner \nAamer Baig\n and coauthors say. Today\u2019s generative-AI boom offers a unique chance for CIOs and CTOs to guide the C-suite in turning the promise of generative AI into sustainable value for the business. It\u2019s worth remembering, however, that while many companies may experiment with new technologies, creating significant business value is often much harder\n.\n\u2022\nNine actions.\n To learn how organizations can be successful with generative AI, McKinsey spoke with dozens of tech leaders and analyzed generative-AI initiatives at more than 50 companies, including our own. As more people use generative-AI tools, we have seen some CIOs and CTOs respond by blocking employee access to publicly available applications to limit risk. Such companies, however, may miss out on opportunities to innovate. \nDiscover nine actions all tech leaders can take\n to create value, scale solutions, and manage risk for generative AI\n.\n\ufeffGet our guide to generative AI\n\u2014 Edited by Belinda Yu, editor, Atlanta\nWas this forwarded to you? \nSign up here\n.\nOr \nsend us feedback\n\u2014we\u2019d love to hear from you.\nFollow our thinking\n \nThis email contains information about McKinsey's research, insights, services, or events.

    "body": "Social networks will always prioritize users' content over brands\u2019 or sponsors\u2019 content, but we can work with that.\n \n \nHi Jacob!\n\u00a0\nIf you\u2019re reading this post, there\u2019s a 99.999% chance that your company is spending a meaningful amount of money on paid digital advertising. Ads.\u00a0\u00a0\n\u00a0\nIf we use EveryoneSocial as a proxy, chances are your company spends somewhere between $2,000-5,000/mo per employee on paid ads. That\u2019s a good amount of money.\u00a0\nIn 2023, companies are going to spend more than $65 billion on paid social advertising, such as sponsored posts, follower campaigns, etc. That\u2019s A LOT of money.\n\u00a0\nHowever, the big dirty secret with paid social is that over time the cost goes up and effectiveness \u2014 what your ads produce in return for every dollar spent \u2014 goes down.\nI repeat: As time passes, social advertising \ncosts increase and effectiveness decreases\n.\n\u00a0\nWhy? Because what\u2019s more important than ad revenue to Facebook, Linkedin, Twitter, and other social networks?\n\u00a0\nUSERS.\n\u00a0\nTo generate the most revenue from their ad offerings, these networks must \nacquire\n and \nretain\n the greatest possible number of users at all times. Just look at the social platform stock charts. The biggest spikes up/down are always associated with user growth/loss.\n\u00a0\nIn other words, users and the content they create are the foundation of any successful social network. They\u2019re its most important asset, which is why all the major social networks \nwill \nalways\n prioritize users'\u00a0content \nover brands\u2019 or sponsors\u2019 content.\n\u00a0\nHere\u2019s what Mark Zuckerberg had to say on the topic in 2018:\nWe built Facebook to help people stay connected and bring us closer together with the people that matter to us. That\u2019s why we\u2019ve always put friends and family at the core of the experience. Research shows that strengthening our relationships improves our well-being and happiness.\n\u00a0\nBut recently we\u2019ve gotten feedback from our community that public content \u2014 posts from businesses, brands, and media \u2014 is crowding out the personal moments that lead us to connect more with each other.\n\u00a0\nBased on this, we\u2019re making a major change to how we build Facebook. I\u2019m changing the goal I give our product teams from focusing on helping you find relevant content to helping you have more meaningful social interactions.\nWe started making changes in this direction last year, but it will take months for this new focus to make its way through all our products. The first changes you\u2019ll see will be in News Feed, where you can expect to see more from your friends, family, and groups.\n\u00a0\nAs we roll this out, you\u2019ll see less public content like posts from businesses, brands, and media.\nSo, what\u2019s a marketer to do?\nWe all need to reach prospective buyers, and social media is where they all are. Certainly, we\u2019re not going to stop spending on paid media, but how can a marketer thrive in this reality?\n\u00a0\nIn short, by enabling its employees to \nuse social media at work\n.\n\u00a0\nGiving your people access to an employee advocacy platform such as EveryoneSocial \u2014 to share company news, engage with their networks, and grow their personal following \u2014 is a fantastic way to turn the social media tables in your favor.\n\u00a0\nAfter all, in the eyes of social networks, employees are \u2026 wait for it\u2026 \nusers\n! Linkedin, Facebook, Twitter, Threads, Instagram, etc., doesn\u2019t distinguish between the personal and the professional you. You\u2019re just you: a person!\n\u00a0\nLet\u2019s take a look at some examples of the results your employees can generate via EveryoneSocial vs. using paid social ads.\n\u00a0\nThe leftmost column in the table below outlines top-of-funnel results our clients\u2019 employees generate through EveryoneSocial. By sharing content from our platform to their networks, employees acquire followers, drive clicks, and generate engagement.\n \nThese are conservative estimates. \u261d\ufe0f Seriously.\n\u00a0\nIf you were to attempt to generate these outcomes by running ads on any major social network\u00a0 \u2014 Facebook, LinkedIn, or Twitter, for example \u2014 you\u2019d very likely pay \na lot\n more than the values shown here.\u00a0 These are starting floors; e.g., Twitter advises that you budget a\u00a0\nminimum\u00a0\nof $3 per follower when running a follower campaign.\n\u00a0\nConversely, a single active employee on EveryoneSocial produces these same outcomes \u2014 by acquiring followers, driving clicks, and generating organic engagements \u2014 at a FAR higher quality (remember, they\u2019re people, not brands) and at a fraction of the cost. Literally cents on the dollar.\n\u00a0\nReady to be blown away?\n\u00a0\nUsing the results our clients\u2019 employees created over the first quarter of this year, multiplied by the average costs per outcome outlined in the table above, EveryoneSocial clients were able to generate the following value.\n \n\u00a0\nTo reiterate, by empowering their people to promote company news and content, EveryoneSocial clients generated more than $200 million in earned media value over the first half of the year.\n\u00a0\nWhat\u2019s more, they were able to generate that ROI for less than one-tenth of the cost of paid social.\n\u00a0\nExcited? You should be!\n\u00a0\nAny company can benefit from \nemployee advocacy\n, and it\u2019s definitely not too late to start. It requires a little time and money, but your investment will build something with lasting value.\n\u00a0\nAs always, we\u2019re here if you need us.\n\u00a0\nThanks for reading, and I hope you have a wonderful weekend!\n\u00a0\nBest,\n\u00a0\nCameron Brain\u00a0\nCEO & Co-Founder\nEveryoneSocial\n\u00a0\nP.S. - Feel free to connect with me on \nLinkedIn\n or \nTwitter\n!\nMake sure to follow us on social media!\n \n \n \n \nEveryoneSocial, 215 W Sego Lily Dr., #708100, Sandy, Utah 84070, United States \nUnsubscribe\n \nManage preferences",

TOMORROW\u2019S INSIGHTS.\nA daily newsletter from McKinsey & Company\n \nBrought to you by \nLiz Hilton Segel\n, chief client officer and managing partner, global industry practices, &\u00a0\nHomayoun Hatami\n, managing partner, global client capabilities\nGeneration gap\nIn the news\n\u2022\nFrom latchkey kid to leader.\n Boomers are making way for Gen X, the independent-minded cohort born from 1965 to 1980, to start calling the shots. With an average age of 54, newly minted CEOs are supporting more flexible, informal work habits. Given the choice, workers over 55 (boomers, for the most part) would want to spend roughly 35% of their working hours at home; workers in their 20s (Gen Zers) approximately 45%; and workers in their 30s and 40s (including millennials and Gen Xers) 50%, a Stanford University study found. [\nNYT\n]\n\u2022\nDon\u2019t \u2018circle back.\u2019\n Millennials and Gen Z workers have one request: please stop with the business jargon. Overrelying on idioms such as \u201cherding cats,\u201d \u201cboiling the ocean,\u201d and \u201cout of pocket\u201d are annoying younger colleagues and confusing workers who aren\u2019t native English speakers. This could hamper workplace inclusivity, according to research by LinkedIn and Duolingo. A survey of 8,000 workers in eight countries found that nearly two-thirds of millennials and 60% of Gen Zers long to hear less jargon in the office. [\nFast Company\n]\n\u201cGen Z verbalizes everything; they tell you what they want and don\u2019t want. Whereas you have to keep tabs on Gen Xers, because they might be quietly lining up a job elsewhere.\u201d\nOn McKinsey.com\n\u2022\nNot so different.\n As multiple generations work side by side at the office, people are paying more attention to age-based differences. New research on generational preferences at work reveals some interesting nuances between different age cohorts, but overall, every generation shares remarkable similarities. At all ages, employees want meaningful work, real connections with coworkers and managers, broader purpose, and fair compensation, partner \nBryan Hancock\n and McKinsey alumnus \nBill Schaninger\n explain\n.\n\u2022\nMore than a paycheck.\n Because Gen Z talks so openly about compensation, managers might assume that\u2019s all that matters to them, Schaninger says. Although money is a critical factor in younger workers\u2019 employment decisions, it\u2019s not their main priority. In the workplace, Gen Zers are motivated by having flexibility, opportunities for career development, and a supportive work environment, McKinsey analysis finds. \nSee how well generational stereotypes stack up\n against our actual research\n.\nLook before you judge\n\u2014 Edited by Belinda Yu, editor, Atlanta\nWas this forwarded to you? \nSign up here\n.\nOr \nsend us feedback\n\u2014we\u2019d love to hear from you.\nFollow our thinking\n \nThis email contains information about McKinsey's research, insights, services, or events.

Today, we want to highlight an effort from our friends at the \nClimate Clock\n. \nAt 12 noon ET on July 22 \u2013 the Climate Clock will tick down below 6 years for the first time, Meaning, we will have less than six years to dramatically reduce fossil fuel emissions in order to stay below 1.5\u00baC degrees warming. This timeline is based on\n IPCC & MCC data\n, the gold standards of climate science. \nOn July 22, people around the world will mark this moment \u2013\n \nClimate Emergency Day\n \u2013 with synchronized actions,\n bringing clocks from climate impact zones to the halls of power, demanding that governments and corporations #ActInTime to meet our climate deadline, and enact the real, system-wide solutions we need.\nYou can participate in many ways. \nSign up here\nGet your own Climate Clock to do a creative action \nPost creative content on social media or send an email blast the moment the clock ticks over - 12pm ET\nAmplify your climate related art project on this day\nCo-sponsor the day as an organization\nTo quote activist \nMariame Kaba\n, \u201cHope is a discipline,\u201d and we hope you will join us in urging governments and corporations to #ActInTime, so that we can maintain hope for a just future.\nPa\u2019lante,\nCarol Zou\nSecretary of Intentional Community,\nU.S. Department of Arts and Culture\nSent via \nActionNetwork.org\n.

What practices have brought the most progress in bringing diversity to leadership rank\n \nMarch 6, 2024 - \nEmployee Engagement: Tapping the Secrets of Energizing Workers\u00a0\nCompanies want their employees to be enthused and involved, yet employers need to be thoughtful in fostering these qualities in authentic ways. What\u2019s the latest thinking about how employers can understand the motivations of their workers\u2013and how to respond? What are the best methods for recognizing achievement, both individually and among teams? What\u2019s the connection between engagement and job satisfaction? In the hybrid work environment, what binds workers together and wards off anxiety and loneliness?\n \nApril 3, 2024 - \nBenefits that Fit Individual Needs Without Busting the Budge\nHaving made a commitment to recognize the unique needs of individuals, the secret is in the execution. What are the emerging benefits and rewards that workers are seeking, from fertility care to financial wellness? How can companies use technology to stay in close touch with what individuals are experiencing\u2013and where they need help as a result? How can companies choose among myriad point solutions and innovative new platforms? What are the most cost-effective rewards in terms of investments and outcomes\nMay 22, 2024 - \nThe Art and Science of Employee Retention, Coaching and Advancement\nWhile the pace of job-hopping has eased, employers have a powerful motivation to retain skilled workers, both for financial and cultural reasons. How can employers use new tools, including AI, to gain insights about what\u2019s inspiring their workers to stay committed\u2013or walk out the door? Since attrition is often caused by poor relationships with managers, what are innovative ways for employers to train their workers to be better leaders at a time when workers have higher expectations for job satisfaction? How can technology help make coaching more effective?\nJune 12, 2024 - \nBringing Talent Acquisition into the Digital Age\nDespite layoffs making headlines now, all the demographic and digital trends point toward tough competition for workers in the future\u2013maybe sooner than most expect.

How can these new tools, including AI, create better matches between employees and projects? How can employers gain insights from the data they gather? Why do real-world simulations help measure certain skills better than traditional assessments?\u00a0\n\u00a0\nJuly 17, 2024 - \nInnovative Benefits That Support Healthy Families and Caregivers\n\u00a0\n \nAs the pandemic\u2019s caregiving crisis showed, employers found significant gaps in their support for the parents and other caregivers in their workforces.

Where is the greatest demand for support, as well as the most innovative new methods? What have been the most cost-effective ways to help caregivers of all kinds, including parents as well as \u201csandwich generation\u201d workers caring for elderly and disabled relatives?\u00a0\n\u00a0\nAug. 7, 2024 - \nEmployee Engagement: Using Technology to Gain Insight Into Work Needs and Ambitions \n\u00a0\nTraditional methods like town-hall meetings and surveys can be effective, but data and well-drawn insights can give top leaders a heads up about evolving patterns and trends in their workforces. How can AI and other technology be deployed in a way that brings new insights yet still respects privacy and the individual human factors at play? What approaches will bring employers new empathy for worker needs, ambitions, and well-being?\u00a0\n\u00a0\n \n\u00a0\nAug. 28, 2024 - \nPursuing Higher Productivity With Human Factors in Mind\n\u00a0\n \nIn a competitive and uncertain climate, most companies need to do more with less.

Who should be the architects of a company\u2019s culture and how should it be designed and constructed? How should the culture be communicated, broadly and in everyday actions? How should a company start out on a project to evolve its culture in a credible way?\u00a0\u00a0\nOct. 16, 2024 - \nModernizing Your Workplace for a More Flexible, Inclusive Era\n\u00a0\n \nThe arrival of hybrid work sent virtually every employer back to the drawing board about what the workplace should look like, including floor plans, digital platforms, meetings, and even office furniture.

Yet this revolution presents new challenges for companies in choosing and supervising these tech tools. How should these tech platforms be evaluated? Which departments of the company should take responsibility\u2013and how can organizations coordinate these moves? How can companies make sure they\u2019re empowering their workers rather than overloading them with adaptation and distraction?\n\u00a0\n \nDec. 11, 2024 - \nPioneering Approaches to Digital Transformation and the Future of Work\n\u00a0\n \nThe emergence of generative AI in 2023 marked the arrival of a transforming technology that will change human roles, add and subtract jobs, and create astounding new capabilities.

Once stores reopened, customers who depended on buying online in 2020 shifted their spending to travel and other services. Retailers need more agility and flexibility built into their supply chains to keep up with unexpected changes in consumer demand and other shocks, so many are investing in forecasting technology and aiming to recruit data scientists. [\nWSJ\n]\n\u2022\nA new lease on life.\n As people move into different homes or remodel an existing space, their tastes and decorative needs may change, sparking a search on an online marketplace or other e-commerce site for just the right table or lamp. Online outlets attracted millions of consumers during the pandemic when brick-and-mortar stores closed their doors. While some buyers thrive on the thrill of the hunt, others may be attracted to an item because of its backstory. When consumers see an item displayed in a staged photo, that heightens their emotions and willingness to purchase it, a marketing professor said. [\nNYT\n]\nMcKinsey analysis shows that online sales in US retail jumped 40% year over year in 2021.\nOn McKinsey.com\n\u2022\nMind the (online) store.\n Buying goods online has become second nature to many consumers. In fact, online transactions are expected to account for nearly 25% of all worldwide sales by 2025. Larger retailers that had already invested in capabilities and infrastructure saw a jump in returns during the pandemic, but many small to medium-size companies realize a much smaller portion of revenue from e-commerce, McKinsey senior partner \nKarel D\u00f6rner\n and coauthors explain. Guarding against five short-term traps could help smaller retailers grow\n.\n\u2022\nLevel up your e-commerce.\n As customer preferences continue to shift postpandemic, companies of all sizes and types can benefit from rethinking their strategies for growth. Channels such as retail media networks and live commerce can help brands and retailers build stronger relationships with customers, while investments in operations (in addition to tech tools) can increase agility and flexibility. Learn how \ne-commerce can generate value\n for a wide range of organizations, including small and large retailers, brands, and consumer-packaged-goods companies\n.\nBoost online sales\n\u2014 Edited by Gwyn Herbein, editor, Atlanta\nWas this forwarded to you? \nSign up here\n.\nOr \nsend us feedback\n\u2014we\u2019d love to hear from you.\nFollow our thinking\n \nThis email contains information about McKinsey's research, insights, services, or events.

    "body": "Your monthly round up of tips, strategies, and insights to help you become a most loved employer.\n \n \nElevating moments that matter for your employees.\n\u00a0\nOk, here\u2019s what we know\u2026\n\u00a0\nGlobally, the majority \n(6 in 10) of employees are disengaged\n\u2014and that disengagement is \ncostly\n. Like $8.8 trillion costly \ud83d\ude48. But! Organizations that prioritize \ninvestment in employee experience (EX)\n are seeing \ngreater workforce productivity\n, \nmore innovation\n, \nmore employee resilience\n, and stronger overall performance.\u00a0\n\u00a0\nEmployee experience is the input that drives the outcomes our businesses need to survive and thrive. Which would make investment in EX a perfect solution to widespread disengagement, right?\u00a0\n\u00a0\nIn theory, absolutely. In practice, it\u2019s a bit more complicated. Because \u201cemployee experience\u201d is big. In fact, it\u2019s everything. Gallup defines employee experience as: \nthe sum of all interactions an employee has with an employer, from pre-recruitment to post-exit, everything from major milestones and personal relationships to technology use and the physical work environment\n.\n\u00a0\nSo where do we focus? How do we, as organizational and people leaders, \ndecide where to put our dollars\n to have the biggest impact on the employee experience and drive our businesses forward?\n\u00a0\nInvestment in employee experience should be ongoing and\u2014ideally\u2014follow guiding principles that are unique to your organization. But, as with anything in business, it\u2019s important to balance short-term and long-term strategies. The reality is most of us can\u2019t wait for slow, large-scale initiatives to kick in; we need to motivate employees yesterday.\n\u00a0\nFor organizations looking to make a noticeable impact on the employee experience right now, \nstart by elevating the workplace moments that matter.\n\u00a0\nMore than 2/3 of working Americans feel underappreciated at work\n but when people \ndo\n feel seen and recognized\u2014especially at critical milestones (e.g. after they\u2019ve gone above and beyond, experienced a particular triumph, \nachieved a marquee anniversary\n, etc.)\u2014they\u2019re more engaged, loyal, and willing to keep going above and beyond.\n\u00a0\nThere\u2019s no doubt that great employee experience is about many things, from offering comprehensive pay and benefits, to how your organization \nconnects employees to purpose\n, to the processes and systems that support consistent, equitable employer-employee interactions.\n\u00a0\nBut \nmeaningful employee rewards and recognition\n are a powerful piece of the puzzle because they allow you to nail particularly important moments in the employee lifecycle; and it\u2019s these moments that make up an employee\u2019s experience with your company, these moments that shape employee sentiment, commitment, and discretionary effort.\n\u00a0\nAs you look to second half of the year, avoid getting stuck in the \u201cwhole\u201d and consider how you can elevate the employee experience in moments and milestones.\n\u00a0\nBe well.\nNatasha Wahid\nDirector of Content\n \nDeep dive on a hot topic\n\u00a0\nNew research: Employee rewards and the employee experience.\n\u00a0\nFresh data from The Starr Conspiracy and Blueboard\n reveals that Employee Experience Leaders\u2014companies that place the highest level of importance and investment in employee experience\u2014are focused on strategic employee recognition and rewards. And they\u2019re seeing compound returns on their efforts to elevate the moments that matter.\n\u00a0\nGet the full report to learn:\n4 key employee experience indicators you can use to understand your organization\u2019s employee experience \u201chealth\u201d\nInsight into how EX Leaders invest in employee reward volume and variety\nWhich types of employee rewards have the most impact on the employee experience\nGet the full report\n \n \nFeatured love letter\n\u00a0\nA candlelit dinner cruise on the Danube, bike tour, and a Hungarian cooking class were the highlights of Eric B.'s Blueboard experience in Budapest!

This piece dives into the 6 main reasons people work (play, purpose, potential, emotional pressure, economic pressure, and inertia). The first three motives tend to \nincrease\n performance, while the latter three hurt it.

TOMORROW\u2019S INSIGHTS.\nA daily newsletter from McKinsey & Company\n \nBrought to you by \nLiz Hilton Segel\n, chief client officer and managing partner, global industry practices, &\u00a0\nHomayoun Hatami\n, managing partner, global client capabilities\nOffice space\ufeff\nIn the news\ufeff\n\u2022\nCubicle farm.\n You might not expect to see fresh produce growing inside an office tower. But in cities around the world, companies are converting empty office space into vertical farms. In one US building, greens and root vegetables are nestled in conveyor belts that move up and down automatically. The crops travel through varying levels of light and darkness that imitate a plant\u2019s 24-hour cycle. Since office towers are climate-controlled, they are ready-made places for growing food, an urban farming leader says. [\nSmithsonian\n]\ufeff\n\u2022\nCities\u2019 vacant offices.\n Schools are full of kids, and cruise lines are packed with travelers, but commercial real estate is still wrestling with high vacancies and lackluster demand. In 2026, when a third of US office leases expire, we can expect rents to fall and vacancies to climb higher still. That threatens cities that depend on commercial property taxes for a significant share of revenue. Rather than increase taxes, which might antagonize affluent residents, cities might highlight what they do best: green transit, walkable pathways, and cultural amenities. [\nAtlantic\n]\ufeff\nFalling demand for office space will drive down value. In the nine cities we studied, a total of $800 billion in value is at stake by 2030.\ufeff\nOn McKinsey.com\n\u2022\nEmpty spaces.\n Vacant office and retail space have grown sharply as hybrid work proliferates. Real estate faces tough challenges in the world's superstar cities\u2014places such as Beijing, Houston, and Paris\u2014which claim a disproportionate share of urban GDP and GDP growth. How long could the pain last? To find out, McKinsey modeled several scenarios. In a moderate scenario, demand for office space may fall 13% in 2030, compared with 2019. In a severe scenario, demand could plunge by as much as 38%, explain \nSven Smit\n, McKinsey\u2019s chair of insights and ecosystems and chair of the McKinsey Global Institute, and coauthors.\n\u2022\nHybrid places.\n As residents move out of the densest city areas, they\u2019re taking their shopping elsewhere. In metropolitan areas, foot traffic near stores remains 10 to 20% below prepandemic levels. Foot traffic is also recovering faster in the suburbs than in more heavily populated areas. Challenges like these may imperil the fiscal health of cities. Yet they might also prompt a historic transformation of urban spaces. Consider what actions cities, developers, and other stakeholders could take \nto turn empty spaces into hybrid places\n.\n\ufeffSee our new research\n\u2014 Edited by Belinda Yu, editor, Atlanta\nWas this forwarded to you? \nSign up here\n.\nOr \nsend us feedback\n\u2014we\u2019d love to hear from you.\nFollow our thinking\n \nThis email contains information about McKinsey's research, insights, services, or events.

But middle management can be a destination rather than a way station, say McKinsey\u2019s \nEmily Field\n, \nBryan Hancock\n, and Bill Schaninger, whose new book \nPower to the Middle: Why Managers Hold the Keys to the Future of Work\n comes out today. In a \nnew\n \nMcKinsey Quarterly\n article\n adapted from the book, they explain that middle managers play a critical role of connecting and integrating people and tasks, and should be viewed as being at the \ncenter\n of an organization\u2014which is why the best middle managers are often best off staying exactly where they are. Abandon the outdated assumptions about the middle layer of management and see why offering the right rewards to your most-valued managers can pay off in the long run.\n \nMiddle managers are the heart of your company\nStop thinking of middle management as a way station. Instead, make it a destination.\nOffer the right rewards\u00a0\u00a0\nQuote of the day\n\u201cMost of the focus for our customers today is around people and ensuring a people-first digital transformation.

Last month in Culture Club we dispelled the myths and shared the science behind the most effective performance reviews.\n\u00a0\nWatch a replay of our \nPerformance Reviews\n\u00a0mini-workshop, to learn how to:\nCrowdsource performance review best practices from a wide range of companies\nLeave with a framework to assess the quality of your own reviews and a list of new ideas to implement\n \nWant to improve your company's performance assessment process?\nTalk with a LifeLabs Consultant\n \n \nAn important paradigm shift is happening in the purpose and process of performance reviews. For a long time, the primary goal of performance assessment was correction. Set performance standards \u2192 measure past performance against those standards \u2192 correct (or reward) performance. In this sense, performance and professional development were seen as one in the same. The only development that was deemed relevant was closing gaps in current performance to achieve current goals.\n\u00a0\nToday, companies \nand\n employees are recognizing that this Performance = Development approach is letting us all down.\n\u00a0\nBut divorcing performance from development entirely doesn\u2019t help either.\nWhen performance and development are separated, employees develop skills that aren't valued by their companies, causing inefficiency and frustration.\n\u00a0\nThe most successful and nimble organizations now take a Performance + Development approach.\u00a0\nThese companies create systems to ensure that employees are supported in achieving high performance today while also developing high leverage skills for the future. At LifeLabs Learning, we refer to high leverage skills as the skills that lie at the intersection of capabilities that companies need now and in the future + the skills that employees find personally rewarding and motivating to attain.\u00a0\n\u00a0\nContinue reading to learn how to integrate development into your performance reviews.\nRead more\n \nKeep learning with our \nPerformance Review Playbook\n:\na guide to help managers \nPeople Ops Leaders build or revamp their performance review systems.\n \nDo you have a LifeLabs experience you'd like to share with the world?

TOMORROW\u2019S INSIGHTS.\nA daily newsletter from McKinsey & Company\n \nBrought to you by \nLiz Hilton Segel\n, chief client officer and managing partner, global industry practices, &\u00a0\nHomayoun Hatami\n, managing partner, global client capabilities\n\ufeffCreating opportunities for UK minorities\nIn the news\ufeff\n\u2022\nWage inequality, meet pay transparency.\n According to data from the European Institute for Gender Equality, closing the gender employment gap could lead to between 3.5 million and 6.0 million new jobs being created by 2050. Wage transparency reporting is one tool countries are using to increase awareness of the issue. Since 2018, companies in the UK with more than 250 employees have reported average wage differences between men and women (based on a rough measure of what men and women earn on average across the workforce), while other countries allow workers to request comparable data. [\nWaPo\n]\ufeff\n\u2022\nUnderrepresented in retail.\n Even though women make up more than 50% of the UK retail workforce (one of the nation\u2019s largest industries), a new report shows they remain underrepresented in leadership roles. New data from a survey of more than 200 businesses reveals that only 41 boast female CEOs or CFOs, while just 13 have female chairs. In addition to the lack of gender diversity, businesses also lack racial diversity in the top ranks: about one-third of boards are made up of only White members. [\nBloomberg\n]\ufeff\nOur analysis shows that closing the pay gap could translate to a 30% increase in the average Black, Bangladeshi, and Pakistani woman\u2019s annual salary.\ufeff\nOn McKinsey.com\n\u2022\nFalling behind.\n UK workers who identify as Black, Bangladeshi, and Pakistani are the furthest behind on pay and labor force participation, and those who fall at the intersection of gender and ethnicity are particularly vulnerable. Compared with all other ethnicity and gender combinations, Black, Bangladeshi, and Pakistani women are at the greatest disadvantage, McKinsey senior partner \nTania Holt\n and colleagues reveal. While more women in these groups aged 16 to 25 are furthering their education and starting careers in higher-paying jobs, Black, Bangladeshi, and Pakistani women aged 26 and older face a growing disparity in pay as they continue their careers, due in part to an underrepresentation in leadership positions\n.\n\u2022\nFor the good of all.\n Improving women\u2019s earning potential translates to economic gains that benefit entire communities. But closing the pay gap for Black, Bangladeshi, and Pakistani women requires targeted effort on the part of employers, starting from an understanding of the economic and cultural experiences of these groups. Recruiting initiatives, professional network building, and transparency in the promotion pipeline could directly improve Black, Bangladeshi, and Pakistani women\u2019s experiences in their organizations. Consider \nfour meaningful actions leaders can take\n to address racial equality at work\n.\n\ufeffAdvance intersectional workers\n\u2014 Edited by Gwyn Herbein, editor, Atlanta\nWas this forwarded to you? \nSign up here\n.\nOr \nsend us feedback\n\u2014we\u2019d love to hear from you.\nFollow our thinking\n \nThis email contains information about McKinsey's research, insights, services, or events.

But even as new factories are popping up across the country, the US confronts a shortage of experienced workers. Vocational schools that partner with auto brands may provide part of the answer. One system of technical colleges in Tennessee has 34,000 students attending; in 2017, the school teamed up with a Japanese electric-vehicle (EV) maker to establish a new campus. [\nBloomberg\n]\n\u2022\nTeenage trainees.\n The EV revolution is here. There\u2019s just one problem: countries need many more skilled workers to produce EV batteries. Throughout Asia, Europe, and North America, many leaders are grappling with the same issue\u2014how to train and recruit battery engineers, technicians, and others needed for the energy transition. One Asian country is enlisting teenagers and trade school students to study battery technology; it aspires to add 30,000 more workers to the battery industry by 2030. [\nQuartz\n]\nSurvey respondents indicate that having caring and inspiring leaders is a top ten factor for staying in or leaving a role and an important reason for accepting a new job.\n\ufeffOn McKinsey.com\n\u2022\nVital skills.\n Auto and mobility leaders face significant skills gaps. But despite recent shake-ups, tech workers are scrutinizing potential employers. What matters most to this crucial part of the workforce? A McKinsey survey of about 1,500 US tech workers finds that career development is the most frequently cited reason for employment-related decisions, with 43% of respondents reporting it as a top factor for why they stay in a current job, accept a new role, or leave one, McKinsey partner \nAsad Husain\n and coauthors explain\n.\n\u2022\nAttracting talent.\n Seven of ten automotive leaders are focusing on building new businesses, previous McKinsey research has shown. Automotive and mobility incumbents now have a chance to snap up tech talent in what could be a singular realignment. However, that will require effectively outlining the expectations and commitments of the worker\u2013employer relationship. See four dimensions of an effective employee value proposition that \nauto and mobility leaders can consider as they seek to attract and retain critical tech workers\n.\nLearn what motivates tech workers\n\u2014 Edited by Belinda Yu, editor, Atlanta\nWas this forwarded to you? \nSign up here\n.\nOr \nsend us feedback\n\u2014we\u2019d love to hear from you.\nFollow our thinking\n \nThis email contains information about McKinsey's research, insights, services, or events.

    "body": "the best day to send emails for replies and the one you should avoid because of high unsubscribes\nOh YES! I have new stats I can share with you.\nWhy am I sending this newsletter on a Sunday? Read on, all will be explained :)\nAnd please allow me to geek out, I promise this will be worth it!\nYou might already know it, but we rolled out our advanced stats analytics about a month ago in QuickMail.\nSince then, it's been recording silently how well each email was sent and opened with proper day attribution.\nWhat's Day attribution? Instead of learning what day most emails are opened, I'm going to share with you the days it's better to\n *send*\n the emails to \nget more opens/replies/clicks\n.\nThis gives us beautiful insights into when we should be sending our emails (not when it gets open, which we have no control over. Big difference).\nWhat day do you think is the best one for optimizing opens?\nor minimizing unsubscribes?\nWell, when it comes to maximizing views, the weekend is your best choice\n by far\n.\nTogether, Saturdays and Sundays were responsible \nfor 1/3rd!! of all the opens\n detected on the system, with Sunday responsible for 18.66% of all generated opens on its own.\nWeekends clearly outperform all the other days of the week by a large margin.\nOpens rate:\nDays emails generating opens were sent:\nSunday: 18.66%\nSaturday: 16.92%\nTuesday: 13.43%\nMonday: 13.1%\nWednesday: 12.85%\nFriday: 12.67%\nThursday: 12.37%\nGiven these, you may be tempted to maximize sending on Saturday and Sunday, but know that we want people to actually \ntake action\n (reply or click on links) not just read their emails.\nClick rate:\nDays emails generating clicks were sent:\nSaturday: 16.9%\nMonday: 15.1%\nFriday: 15.07%\nWednesday: 14.05%\nThursday: 13.84%\nTuesday: 13.71%\nSunday: 11.33%\nLook at how poor Sunday is for clicks! Sunday was only responsible for 11.33% of total clicks detected, compared to 16.9% on Saturday.\nPeople who open emails sent on Sunday don't really want to engage in research/checking what this is about really.\nEmails sent on Saturday generate more clicks.\nCool, but what about replies?\nReply rate:\nDays emails generating replies were sent:\nSunday: 15.48%\nTuesday: 15.17%\nWednesday: 15.17%\nMonday: 14.11%\nThursday: 13.51%\nSaturday: 13.35%\nFriday: 13.20%\nReplies are clearly indicating that it's bad to send emails toward the end of the week, with Thursday, Friday & Saturday performing poorly. Don't you dare send cold emails on a Friday if you want an answer :)\nWe also learn that people are open for business for emails sent on Sunday! Sending on Sunday will get you the best visibility and best reply rate but don't expect clicks.\nThis may be a day when people try to quickly clean up their inbox before going to work on Monday.\nUnsubscribe rate\nI can explain previous stats but the truly shocking one is unsubscribes\u2026\nDays emails generating unsubscribes were sent:\nThursday: 30%\nTuesday: 16.48%\nWednesday: 12%\nMonday: 11.6%\nFriday: 10.78%\nSatursday: 10.48%\nSunday: 8.65%\nWOW, look at the difference between sending email on Thursday vs Sunday!\nAlmost a THIRD\n of the unsubscribes are coming from emails sent on Thursday! WTF? \nI have no idea why Thursday would lead to so many unsubscribes but if you have a theory, I'd love to hear it.\nConclusion\nIt looks like sending cold emails past Wednesday is a bad idea. It may be best to wait Sunday to start that new campaign after all :)\nIt certainly won't compensate for a bad copy, but it may give you an edge as you increase your odds of success.\nFuture?\nNow we have AI, we'll start tracking if people answering emails sent on Sundays are more inclined to reply positively or negatively. I'm super curious about this.\nAfter all, positive replies are what we are after. Are there days when people are more in the mood to reply positively?\nPlus, I'll provide information on how long it takes people to reply on average so you can optimize wait time between emails to maximize awareness without being too pushy and rubbing some feathers.\nSubCampaigns & AI\nWe finally rolled out SubCampaigns in QuickMail for every reply type we support with AI detection as well as Out of Office detection.\nWant to send a follow-up email asking them how their time out of the office went to get more replies? It's now possible.\nHead over to your account settings (Settings / Replies) and select the campaign to send (make sure your campaign starts with a Wait step so you don't send the email immediately)\nGot AI activated for your account? You are in luck.\nNo need to waste time to execute all the requests for unsubscribes, the AI automatically detects a request for unsubscribe and sets the prospect as Do Not Contact.\nIt won't even create an opportunity. No time wasted. Pretty neat.\nFinally, you can extend the idea to pretty much all replies. Head over to your campaign settings and configure the AI to automatically start a campaign base on the reply type detected.\nIt will skip the creation of an opportunity and start automatically the prospect on the new campaign.\nPodcast: Re-Engaging Your Prospects After Two Years?\nHow much later is it still ok to re-engage prospects? Apparently, even after two years.\nIn this week's episode, we tear down an Appsumo re-engagement campaign and highlight what's bad, what's good, and what could be much better.\nTeardowns are \npacked\n with actionable tips you can apply to your campaigns right away to get better results from your outreach.\nDon't miss it -> \nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LFESO0iCCJ0\nWant us to cover a specific topic? Shoot your idea over at \npodcast@quickmail.io\nTool of the week: Slite\nLooking for a Notion alternative that gives you easy access to your team's knowledge base\n? Check out \nSlite\n.\nSlite is a modern workspace that helps teams escape the chaos of information overload. It combines intuitive documents with async decision-making, enables teams to bring clarity to their work, and helps to take the pain out of finding info and learning from the past with it's AI assistant.\nFound a great tool that isn't known enough? Hit reply and let me know.\nThat's it for today.\nBe amazing,\nJeremy\nPS: Want to forward this newsletter to a friend?
