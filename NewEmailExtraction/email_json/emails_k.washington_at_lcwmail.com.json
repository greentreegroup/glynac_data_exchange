I reviewed the spreadsheet. A few things:\n\u00a0\nThe new pricing also contained changes to \nhourly consulting\n. I\u2019ve collapsed rows 10 (hourly consulting) and what used to be row 11 (D&I Strategy hourly) into a single \u201cConsulting (Hourly)\u201d.\u00a0 New pricing is $250/hr for AC/C and $600 for SC/PC. I changed it on the attached and removed the yellow for this row. \n\u00a0\nRow 24, \u2018project management time\u2019 \u2013 I wasn\u2019t aware of this line item previously. Instead of $0 let\u2019s make this one $250/hour to match the AC/C consulting hour fee renamed it to \u201cProject Management (Hourly)\u201d. \u00a0\n\u00a0\nRows 29-57 \u2013 Total overhaul here. There is no longer an \u2018onsite premium\u2019 \u2013 we\u2019re simply charging onsite sessions one way and virtual sessions a different way, based on duration of workshop and # of facilitators, regardless of which session it is \u2013 EXCEPT for cultural immersions. I added the items in red on rows 29 and 35. \n\u00a0\nI deleted all rows that previously contained specific workshop names, including the miniworkshops (again, EXCEPT for the immersions).\n\u00a0\nI also changed the site license prices for our eLearnings from $80k to $60k (green rows 71, 73-75, 77-79, 81). Please do change those too \nunless Dan or Chuck is vehemently opposed\n. \n\u00a0\nWhen do you think you could get these changed on Compass by, KW?\n \n\u00a0\nRebecca M.

I reviewed the spreadsheet. A few things:\n\u00a0\nThe new pricing also contained changes to \nhourly consulting\n. I\u2019ve collapsed rows 10 (hourly consulting) and what used to be row 11 (D&I Strategy hourly) into a single \u201cConsulting (Hourly)\u201d.\u00a0 New pricing is $250/hr for AC/C and $600 for SC/PC. I changed it on the attached and removed the yellow for this row. \n\u00a0\nRow 24, \u2018project management time\u2019 \u2013 I wasn\u2019t aware of this line item previously. Instead of $0 let\u2019s make this one $250/hour to match the AC/C consulting hour fee renamed it to \u201cProject Management (Hourly)\u201d. \u00a0\n\u00a0\nRows 29-57 \u2013 Total overhaul here. There is no longer an \u2018onsite premium\u2019 \u2013 we\u2019re simply charging onsite sessions one way and virtual sessions a different way, based on duration of workshop and # of facilitators, regardless of which session it is \u2013 EXCEPT for cultural immersions. I added the items in red on rows 29 and 35. \n\u00a0\nI deleted all rows that previously contained specific workshop names, including the miniworkshops (again, EXCEPT for the immersions).\n\u00a0\nI also changed the site license prices for our eLearnings from $80k to $60k (green rows 71, 73-75, 77-79, 81). Please do change those too \nunless Dan or Chuck is vehemently opposed\n. \n\u00a0\nWhen do you think you could get these changed on Compass by, KW?\n \n\u00a0\nRebecca M.

I reviewed the spreadsheet. A few things:\n\u00a0\nThe new pricing also contained changes to \nhourly consulting\n. I\u2019ve collapsed rows 10 (hourly consulting) and what used to be row 11 (D&I Strategy hourly) into a single \u201cConsulting (Hourly)\u201d.\u00a0 New pricing is $250/hr for AC/C and $600 for SC/PC. I changed it on the attached and removed the yellow for this row. \n\u00a0\nRow 24, \u2018project management time\u2019 \u2013 I wasn\u2019t aware of this line item previously. Instead of $0 let\u2019s make this one $250/hour to match the AC/C consulting hour fee renamed it to \u201cProject Management (Hourly)\u201d. \u00a0\n\u00a0\nRows 29-57 \u2013 Total overhaul here. There is no longer an \u2018onsite premium\u2019 \u2013 we\u2019re simply charging onsite sessions one way and virtual sessions a different way, based on duration of workshop and # of facilitators, regardless of which session it is \u2013 EXCEPT for cultural immersions. I added the items in red on rows 29 and 35. \n\u00a0\nI deleted all rows that previously contained specific workshop names, including the miniworkshops (again, EXCEPT for the immersions).\n\u00a0\nI also changed the site license prices for our eLearnings from $80k to $60k (green rows 71, 73-75, 77-79, 81). Please do change those too \nunless Dan or Chuck is vehemently opposed\n. \n\u00a0\nWhen do you think you could get these changed on Compass by, KW?\n \n\u00a0\nRebecca M.

The \nLCW Products + Pricing \ntab is the one I\u2019m working on. I used the \nNew Pricing \nsheet Chuck sent too but just making sure this all makes sense. The stuff in yellow is \nNOT \nchanged. Does everything else look right? \n\u00a0\nAlso, is there any pricing changes for the products in yellow? \n\u00a0\nThanks\n\u00a0\nKendall Washington\n(he/him)\nLCW\nWebsite\n\u00a0\n|\n\u00a0\nTwitter\n \n|\n\u00a0\nFacebook\n\u00a0\n|\n\u00a0\nLinkedIn\nView our upcoming events\n | \nSign-up for our newsletter",

    "body": "Thanks Kendall. I realized I had missed a couple of things in the \u201cnotes\u201d section yesterday, so I\u2019ve attached a clean version of the spreadsheet, with the changed items in green. Would you mind double checking that it all aligns in compass? (for example, rows 5 and 6, changing the $165 to $125, plus I think I deleted the notes on row 22, and I changed the bundle amount on rows 71, 73-75, 77-79, and 81 to $40k from $50k.)

However, I do have a lingering concern. The billable work for Translation isn't accurate, as only Diligent is listed. We're missing entries for all the translation clients, such as Alliant and Catalent. Although I recorded all that work under Diligent for my own timekeeping and reference, I believe this needs to be corrected.\nFurthermore, I noticed that each Statement of Work (SOW) is properly listed for the consultants, allowing them to track their time effectively for each project. We lack this breakdown for translation. Currently, all billables are lumped under Diligent's general category, with no distinction by translation client or SOW (Scoro Quote number). Please let me know who I should reach out to enter more billable categories for translation. I will be happy to enter them as well each time a project is approved after quoting. \n\u00a0\nMaria Fagrelius\nDirector of Global Language Solutions\nLCW\n\u00a0\nWebsite\n\u00a0\n|\n\u00a0\nTwitter\n \n|\n\u00a0\nFacebook\n\u00a0\n|\n\u00a0\nLinkedIn\nView our upcoming events\n | \nSign-up for our newsletter\n\u00a0\nFrom:\n Chuck Adams <\nc.adams@lcwmail.com\n> \nSent:\n Friday, August 18, 2023 10:06 AM\nTo:\n Maria Fagrelius <\nm.fagrelius@lcwmail.com\n>\nSubject:\n RE: Clockify - UPDATE\n\u00a0\nLet\u2019s chat next week.\n\u00a0\nHere are the categories:\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\nChuck Adams\n \n(He/Him)\nCo-CEO and Managing Principal\nLCW\nOffice: \n+1.773.938.4285\nMobile: +1.630.373.5068\n\u00a0\nWebsite\n\u00a0\n|\n\u00a0\nTwitter\n \n|\n\u00a0\nFacebook\n\u00a0\n|\n\u00a0\nLinkedIn\nView our upcoming events\n | \nSign-up for our newsletter\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\nFrom:\n Maria Fagrelius <\nm.fagrelius@lcwmail.com\n> \nSent:\n Friday, August 18, 2023 7:53 AM\nTo:\n Chuck Adams <\nc.adams@lcwmail.com\n>\nSubject:\n RE: Clockify - UPDATE\n\u00a0\nHappy Friday, Chuck!\nThank you for the reminder. I will be happy to start \"clokifying\" my hours next week. As you can imagine, I spent most of my week catching up with my emails, projects, meetings, and a few new proposals for Diligent, Alliant and Catalent.\nI quickly looked at the software setup this morning and realized that it only works for translation when we are working on an LCW project that's already on the list. How should I clockify all these proposals from this week (as shown in the screenshot below)? Do I need to get in touch with Kendall to have them entered? I'm also curious about how to enter internal meetings, administrative tasks, etc. Could we discuss this? Please let me know if you have some time next week.

However, I do have a lingering concern. The billable work for Translation isn't accurate, as only Diligent is listed. We're missing entries for all the translation clients, such as Alliant and Catalent. Although I recorded all that work under Diligent for my own timekeeping and reference, I believe this needs to be corrected.\nFurthermore, I noticed that each Statement of Work (SOW) is properly listed for the consultants, allowing them to track their time effectively for each project. We lack this breakdown for translation. Currently, all billables are lumped under Diligent's general category, with no distinction by translation client or SOW (Scoro Quote number). Please let me know who I should reach out to enter more billable categories for translation. I will be happy to enter them as well each time a project is approved after quoting. \n\u00a0\nMaria Fagrelius\nDirector of Global Language Solutions\nLCW\n\u00a0\nWebsite\n\u00a0\n|\n\u00a0\nTwitter\n \n|\n\u00a0\nFacebook\n\u00a0\n|\n\u00a0\nLinkedIn\nView our upcoming events\n | \nSign-up for our newsletter\n\u00a0\nFrom:\n Chuck Adams <\nc.adams@lcwmail.com\n> \nSent:\n Friday, August 18, 2023 10:06 AM\nTo:\n Maria Fagrelius <\nm.fagrelius@lcwmail.com\n>\nSubject:\n RE: Clockify - UPDATE\n\u00a0\nLet\u2019s chat next week.\n\u00a0\nHere are the categories:\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\nChuck Adams\n \n(He/Him)\nCo-CEO and Managing Principal\nLCW\nOffice: \n+1.773.938.4285\nMobile: +1.630.373.5068\n\u00a0\nWebsite\n\u00a0\n|\n\u00a0\nTwitter\n \n|\n\u00a0\nFacebook\n\u00a0\n|\n\u00a0\nLinkedIn\nView our upcoming events\n | \nSign-up for our newsletter\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\nFrom:\n Maria Fagrelius <\nm.fagrelius@lcwmail.com\n> \nSent:\n Friday, August 18, 2023 7:53 AM\nTo:\n Chuck Adams <\nc.adams@lcwmail.com\n>\nSubject:\n RE: Clockify - UPDATE\n\u00a0\nHappy Friday, Chuck!\nThank you for the reminder. I will be happy to start \"clokifying\" my hours next week. As you can imagine, I spent most of my week catching up with my emails, projects, meetings, and a few new proposals for Diligent, Alliant and Catalent.\nI quickly looked at the software setup this morning and realized that it only works for translation when we are working on an LCW project that's already on the list. How should I clockify all these proposals from this week (as shown in the screenshot below)? Do I need to get in touch with Kendall to have them entered? I'm also curious about how to enter internal meetings, administrative tasks, etc. Could we discuss this? Please let me know if you have some time next week.

However, I do have a lingering concern. The billable work for Translation isn't accurate, as only Diligent is listed. We're missing entries for all the translation clients, such as Alliant and Catalent. Although I recorded all that work under Diligent for my own timekeeping and reference, I believe this needs to be corrected.\nFurthermore, I noticed that each Statement of Work (SOW) is properly listed for the consultants, allowing them to track their time effectively for each project. We lack this breakdown for translation. Currently, all billables are lumped under Diligent's general category, with no distinction by translation client or SOW (Scoro Quote number). Please let me know who I should reach out to enter more billable categories for translation. I will be happy to enter them as well each time a project is approved after quoting. \n\u00a0\nMaria Fagrelius\nDirector of Global Language Solutions\nLCW\n\u00a0\nWebsite\n\u00a0\n|\n\u00a0\nTwitter\n \n|\n\u00a0\nFacebook\n\u00a0\n|\n\u00a0\nLinkedIn\nView our upcoming events\n | \nSign-up for our newsletter\n\u00a0\nFrom:\n Chuck Adams <\nc.adams@lcwmail.com\n> \nSent:\n Friday, August 18, 2023 10:06 AM\nTo:\n Maria Fagrelius <\nm.fagrelius@lcwmail.com\n>\nSubject:\n RE: Clockify - UPDATE\n\u00a0\nLet\u2019s chat next week.\n\u00a0\nHere are the categories:\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\nChuck Adams\n \n(He/Him)\nCo-CEO and Managing Principal\nLCW\nOffice: \n+1.773.938.4285\nMobile: +1.630.373.5068\n\u00a0\nWebsite\n\u00a0\n|\n\u00a0\nTwitter\n \n|\n\u00a0\nFacebook\n\u00a0\n|\n\u00a0\nLinkedIn\nView our upcoming events\n | \nSign-up for our newsletter\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\nFrom:\n Maria Fagrelius <\nm.fagrelius@lcwmail.com\n> \nSent:\n Friday, August 18, 2023 7:53 AM\nTo:\n Chuck Adams <\nc.adams@lcwmail.com\n>\nSubject:\n RE: Clockify - UPDATE\n\u00a0\nHappy Friday, Chuck!\nThank you for the reminder. I will be happy to start \"clokifying\" my hours next week. As you can imagine, I spent most of my week catching up with my emails, projects, meetings, and a few new proposals for Diligent, Alliant and Catalent.\nI quickly looked at the software setup this morning and realized that it only works for translation when we are working on an LCW project that's already on the list. How should I clockify all these proposals from this week (as shown in the screenshot below)? Do I need to get in touch with Kendall to have them entered? I'm also curious about how to enter internal meetings, administrative tasks, etc. Could we discuss this? Please let me know if you have some time next week.

This feature is particularly valuable when demonstrating product features or showcasing various functionalities. Users can conveniently access their Clips through their client or web portal, and receive notifications about views, comments, and replies related to their Clips. The feature can be enabled or disabled at the account, group, or user level and is available for public beta during this release. To learn more about Zoom Clips, visit the \nZoom Clips\n\u00a0\nsupport page. \nZoom Client\n\u00a0Updates \nMeeting Summary: Next Steps and Segment Titles \u2013 Windows, macOS \u2013 \nThe Meeting Summary feature, which uses AI to analyze and summarize in-meeting discussions, is enhanced to also include a list of next steps mentioned in the meeting and titles for each segment of the meeting . These next steps and segment titles are included in the email and Team Chat summary shared with the host and participants (if allowed). \nZoom Web\n\u00a0Updates \nEnhanced feedback form: Admin control\n\u00a0\n\u2013 The Give Feedback form, available in the desktop client and mobile app, is redesigned to enable customers to provide satisfaction scores and provide feedback on Zoom\u2019s product suite. Admins can choose to provide this feedback option for users on their account, as well as allow users to provide text feedback or just satisfaction scores. This setting is available at the account, group, and user levels.\u00a0 \nAuto-start Meeting Summary with Zoom IQ \n\u2013 Admins can allow their users to have the Meeting Summary feature automatically start for any meetings they host, skipping the need for them to manually enable the summary generation during their meetings. Users can still stop and start the summary as needed in the meeting. This is available as a sub-setting to the current Meeting Summary with Zoom IQ setting, available at the account, group, and user-level settings pages. \nAdditional captioning language support \n\u2013 Automated captioning support is expanding to include captioning for the Farsi/Persian and Romanian languages, both in Beta. These languages are enabled by default, but admins can control the availability of these languages through the Automated captions setting within the web portal. \nAdditional translated captioning language support\n \u2013 Translated captioning support is expanding to include caption translation from English to Tamil and English to Hebrew, as well as translation support between Portuguese, Romanian Persian, and Canadian French with all other currently supported languages. All of these newly supported languages are currently in Beta. These languages are enabled by default, but admins can control the availability of these languages through the Translated captions setting within the web portal. \nZoom Scheduler\n\u00a0Updates \nAllow attendees to add guests to scheduled appointments\n\u00a0\n\u2013 Attendees can add guests when they book or reschedule an appointment. A maximum of 100 guests can be added to an appointment. Additionally, guests can reschedule, decline, or delete an appointment. Previously, attendees had to add guests after creating an appointment outside Zoom Scheduler within their calendaring application. \nZoom IQ for Sales\n\u00a0Updates \nMulti-Language transcript translation\n\u00a0\n\u2013 Users can easily translate conversation transcripts into multiple languages on demand and save these translations for future viewing. This feature currently supports Chinese, Dutch, French, German, Hindi, Italian, Japanese, Korean, Portuguese, Russian, Spanish, Ukrainian, and Vietnamese in addition to English.\u00a0 \nZoom Phone\n\u00a0Updates \nProvisioning Template \n\u2013 Account owners and administrators can no longer utilize the parameters provisioning/firmware/url and provision.url in the provisioning template. If these parameters are being updated in an existing template or included in a new template, an error will occur, indicating the need for their removal. However, templates created before this change will remain unaffected, and no action is required for them. If configuring these items is critical, \nsubmit a request\n\u00a0\nto Zoom Support to have this enabled for your account. \nProvisioning walkthrough for Zoom Phone admins\n \u2013 Shows admins how to add users to their Zoom account and provision them with the desired Zoom Phone calling plans (extensions) and phone numbers as quickly and efficiently as possible. \nZoom Events\n\u00a0Updates \nUpload recording files to Zoom's cloud recording storage for simulive \n\u2013 A recording file can be placed into Zoom's cloud recording storage and linked to the hub so that the hub owner or hub hosts can choose it when they are scheduling a simulive webinar. Hosts can set up a simulive webinar and upload their own preferred video. Once the video is processed, it can be selected as the simulive source. Uploaded recordings are also visible in the Zoom web portal recording list and are tagged with the \u201cFrom a Zoom Events Hub\u201d label. \nNote: This feature must be enabled by Zoom. Zoom Events users who have qualified for video replacement can also upload recordings for Simulive. Zoom Events users who are not on a qualifying account can use Simulive but can only select from existing hub recordings. For additional questions, \ncontact Zoom Support\n\u00a0\nto discuss whether this feature is available for your account. \nSecurity code at event join\n \u2013 Hosts can enable the Security code at join option in the event creation setup. A security code will be sent to each attendee's inbox every time they join the host's event. Depending on the attendees' event authentication portfolio, attendees who join an event with the\u00a0 Security code at join option enabled will have different scenarios. \nZoom Whiteboard\n\u00a0Updates \nAllow users who are not signed in to create in-meeting whiteboards \n\u2013 Users who are not signed in can initiate and take part in whiteboard sessions during a Zoom meeting, leveraging the \"Host owns all boards\" feature. This functionality enables unsigned users to view and create a whiteboard, which will be owned by the host since the user is not signed in. To simplify the sign-in process, sign-in options are displayed within both the meeting and whiteboarding interfaces, enabling users to conveniently sign in while actively participating in a meeting or whiteboarding session. \nZoom Virtual Agent\n\u00a0Updates \nAmazon Connect integration \n\u2013 Account owners and admins can integrate Zoom Virtual Agent with Amazon Connect. This feature can be leveraged to enable the utilization of Amazon Connect as a chat platform when this feature is enabled for the Customer Relationship Management (CRM). With this integration, the knowledge base team can also create a knowledge base sync with Amazon Connect system, mirroring the familiar structure of existing CRM integrations. \nZoom Contact Center\n\u00a0Updates\nEnhancement to 10DLC registration\n \u2013 To comply with carrier regulations and avoid potential message blocking and surcharges, Zoom Contact Center is introducing a warning message for agents who send SMS from US/CA Virtual Service numbers but have not created a 10DLC campaign. This warning will be displayed whenever agents send messages via the Zoom Contact Center client. Messages will not be blocked if a valid 10DLC campaign is active, pending, or associated with the phone number used for messaging. SMS-enabled numbers that are not US/CA numbers are exempt from this requirement.\nBusiness Announcements\nUpcoming Support Site Maintenance\n \u2013 Maintenance is being performed on Zoom\u2019s support site in November (date and time coming soon). During this time, \nsupport.zoom.us\n\u00a0\nand the support ticketing form will not be accessible, t hough you can still use Zoom Community, chatbot, and phone support (\nbased on your plan\n) . Please note that once maintenance is performed, tickets closed more than a year ago will no longer be accessible. You can refer to the \nsupport article\n\u00a0\nand check the \nZoom status page\n\u00a0\ncloser to November for more information. \nZoom Software Lifecycle Policy\u00a0\n\u2013 We plan to enforce the next round of our Software Lifecycle Policy on \nNovember 4, 2023\n, for all products and services, starting with the minimum versions referenced in the table found \nhere\n. Users running an end-of-life version after \nNovember 4\n will not be able to join meetings via the Zoom Client and will be prompted to update or join from the Web browser. As always, we highly recommend you regularly download and update to the latest version of Zoom software by checking for updates within the Zoom desktop client or by navigating to \nzoom.us/download\n to take advantage of all our latest security and functionality features. \nHappy Zooming,\nZoom Success Advisor\nYou're receiving this email because you are a Zoom customer.\nIf you wish to be removed from our email list, \nunsubscribe\n.",

However, I do have a lingering concern. The billable work for Translation isn't accurate, as only Diligent is listed. We're missing entries for all the translation clients, such as Alliant and Catalent. Although I recorded all that work under Diligent for my own timekeeping and reference, I believe this needs to be corrected.\nFurthermore, I noticed that each Statement of Work (SOW) is properly listed for the consultants, allowing them to track their time effectively for each project. We lack this breakdown for translation. Currently, all billables are lumped under Diligent's general category, with no distinction by translation client or SOW (Scoro Quote number). Please let me know who I should reach out to enter more billable categories for translation. I will be happy to enter them as well each time a project is approved after quoting. \n\u00a0\nMaria Fagrelius\nDirector of Global Language Solutions\nLCW\n\u00a0\nWebsite\n\u00a0\n|\n\u00a0\nTwitter\n \n|\n\u00a0\nFacebook\n\u00a0\n|\n\u00a0\nLinkedIn\nView our upcoming events\n | \nSign-up for our newsletter\n\u00a0\nFrom:\n Chuck Adams <\nc.adams@lcwmail.com\n> \nSent:\n Friday, August 18, 2023 10:06 AM\nTo:\n Maria Fagrelius <\nm.fagrelius@lcwmail.com\n>\nSubject:\n RE: Clockify - UPDATE\n\u00a0\nLet\u2019s chat next week.\n\u00a0\nHere are the categories:\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\nChuck Adams\n \n(He/Him)\nCo-CEO and Managing Principal\nLCW\nOffice: \n+1.773.938.4285\nMobile: +1.630.373.5068\n\u00a0\nWebsite\n\u00a0\n|\n\u00a0\nTwitter\n \n|\n\u00a0\nFacebook\n\u00a0\n|\n\u00a0\nLinkedIn\nView our upcoming events\n | \nSign-up for our newsletter\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\nFrom:\n Maria Fagrelius <\nm.fagrelius@lcwmail.com\n> \nSent:\n Friday, August 18, 2023 7:53 AM\nTo:\n Chuck Adams <\nc.adams@lcwmail.com\n>\nSubject:\n RE: Clockify - UPDATE\n\u00a0\nHappy Friday, Chuck!\nThank you for the reminder.

However, I do have a lingering concern. The billable work for Translation isn't accurate, as only Diligent is listed. We're missing entries for all the translation clients, such as Alliant and Catalent. Although I recorded all that work under Diligent for my own timekeeping and reference, I believe this needs to be corrected.\nFurthermore, I noticed that each Statement of Work (SOW) is properly listed for the consultants, allowing them to track their time effectively for each project. We lack this breakdown for translation. Currently, all billables are lumped under Diligent's general category, with no distinction by translation client or SOW (Scoro Quote number). Please let me know who I should reach out to enter more billable categories for translation. I will be happy to enter them as well each time a project is approved after quoting. \n\u00a0\nMaria Fagrelius\nDirector of Global Language Solutions\nLCW\n\u00a0\nWebsite\n\u00a0\n|\n\u00a0\nTwitter\n \n|\n\u00a0\nFacebook\n\u00a0\n|\n\u00a0\nLinkedIn\nView our upcoming events\n | \nSign-up for our newsletter\n\u00a0\nFrom:\n Chuck Adams <\nc.adams@lcwmail.com\n> \nSent:\n Friday, August 18, 2023 10:06 AM\nTo:\n Maria Fagrelius <\nm.fagrelius@lcwmail.com\n>\nSubject:\n RE: Clockify - UPDATE\n\u00a0\nLet\u2019s chat next week.\n\u00a0\nHere are the categories:\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\nChuck Adams\n \n(He/Him)\nCo-CEO and Managing Principal\nLCW\nOffice: \n+1.773.938.4285\nMobile: +1.630.373.5068\n\u00a0\nWebsite\n\u00a0\n|\n\u00a0\nTwitter\n \n|\n\u00a0\nFacebook\n\u00a0\n|\n\u00a0\nLinkedIn\nView our upcoming events\n | \nSign-up for our newsletter\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\nFrom:\n Maria Fagrelius <\nm.fagrelius@lcwmail.com\n> \nSent:\n Friday, August 18, 2023 7:53 AM\nTo:\n Chuck Adams <\nc.adams@lcwmail.com\n>\nSubject:\n RE: Clockify - UPDATE\n\u00a0\nHappy Friday, Chuck!\nThank you for the reminder. I will be happy to start \"clokifying\" my hours next week. As you can imagine, I spent most of my week catching up with my emails, projects, meetings, and a few new proposals for Diligent, Alliant and Catalent.\nI quickly looked at the software setup this morning and realized that it only works for translation when we are working on an LCW project that's already on the list. How should I clockify all these proposals from this week (as shown in the screenshot below)? Do I need to get in touch with Kendall to have them entered? I'm also curious about how to enter internal meetings, administrative tasks, etc. Could we discuss this? Please let me know if you have some time next week.

However, I do have a lingering concern. The billable work for Translation isn't accurate, as only Diligent is listed. We're missing entries for all the translation clients, such as Alliant and Catalent. Although I recorded all that work under Diligent for my own timekeeping and reference, I believe this needs to be corrected.\nFurthermore, I noticed that each Statement of Work (SOW) is properly listed for the consultants, allowing them to track their time effectively for each project. We lack this breakdown for translation. Currently, all billables are lumped under Diligent's general category, with no distinction by translation client or SOW (Scoro Quote number). Please let me know who I should reach out to enter more billable categories for translation. I will be happy to enter them as well each time a project is approved after quoting. \n\u00a0\nMaria Fagrelius\nDirector of Global Language Solutions\nLCW\n\u00a0\nWebsite\n\u00a0\n|\n\u00a0\nTwitter\n \n|\n\u00a0\nFacebook\n\u00a0\n|\n\u00a0\nLinkedIn\nView our upcoming events\n | \nSign-up for our newsletter\n\u00a0\nFrom:\n Chuck Adams <\nc.adams@lcwmail.com\n> \nSent:\n Friday, August 18, 2023 10:06 AM\nTo:\n Maria Fagrelius <\nm.fagrelius@lcwmail.com\n>\nSubject:\n RE: Clockify - UPDATE\n\u00a0\nLet\u2019s chat next week.\n\u00a0\nHere are the categories:\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\nChuck Adams\n \n(He/Him)\nCo-CEO and Managing Principal\nLCW\nOffice: \n+1.773.938.4285\nMobile: +1.630.373.5068\n\u00a0\nWebsite\n\u00a0\n|\n\u00a0\nTwitter\n \n|\n\u00a0\nFacebook\n\u00a0\n|\n\u00a0\nLinkedIn\nView our upcoming events\n | \nSign-up for our newsletter\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\nFrom:\n Maria Fagrelius <\nm.fagrelius@lcwmail.com\n> \nSent:\n Friday, August 18, 2023 7:53 AM\nTo:\n Chuck Adams <\nc.adams@lcwmail.com\n>\nSubject:\n RE: Clockify - UPDATE\n\u00a0\nHappy Friday, Chuck!\nThank you for the reminder. I will be happy to start \"clokifying\" my hours next week.

How should I clockify all these proposals from this week (as shown in the screenshot below)? Do I need to get in touch with Kendall to have them entered?

The consulting team is already well on its way on this transition.\n\u00a0\nOne action item I would add is downloading all of the data stored on Survey Monkey in Excel form. This likely falls to Kendall. \n\u00a0\nWe can ask if there are any ongoing survey monkey surveys, and if not, potentially cancel sooner.\n\u00a0\nThanks!\n\u00a0\nDan\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\nDaniel Gough, PhD\n(he/him)\nPrincipal Consultant\nLCW\nWebsite\n\u00a0\n|\n\u00a0\nTwitter\n \n|\n\u00a0\nFacebook\n\u00a0\n|\n\u00a0\nLinkedIn\nView our upcoming events\n | \nSign-up for our newsletter\n\u00a0\nFrom:\n Briza Cardenas <\nb.cardenas@lcwmail.com\n> \nSent:\n Wednesday, September 6, 2023 10:26 AM\nTo:\n Daniel Gough <\nd.gough@lcwmail.com\n>\nSubject:\n SurveyMonkey/MS Forms decision before 9/16\n\u00a0\nHi Dan,\n\u00a0\nThe yearly SurveyMonkey renewal is coming up on September 16\nth\n. The comparison work to decide whether to keep SurveyMonkey or end our contract with them was assigned to Sarah. With her current circumstance I don\u2019t think she\u2019ll have time to get to this. To help with the final decision, a few of us have met and discussed this topic with a plan on the transition. \n\u00a0\nRecommendation:\n Cancel the SurveyMonkey subscription, but if we don\u2019t want to end it so soon, we can switch over to month to month for the remainder of the year to fully transition. \n\u00a0\nBelow are the three concerns folks expressed with canceling SurveyMonkey:\nPast data & reports - Kendall is downloading all data and saving it in Dropbox\nPost facilitation surveys - Consultants have piloted these surveys in MS Forms\nNPS survey - MS Forms has the same function as SurveyMonkey \n\u00a0\nCost:\n$900/year - SurveyMonkey\n$25/month for 1 seat - SurveyMonkey\nIncluded in Microsoft - MS Forms\n\u00a0\nSurveyMonkey only allows 3 seats, with Kendall owning verification codes and platform management\nMS Forms - Everyone has access to MS Forms and there will be no holdup getting codes or access to the platform\n\u00a0\nShort-Term\nKeep SurveyMonkey drop down seats, switch over to month-to month \n(3 months max),\n and only use as a back-up\nUpskill the staff on how to use MS Forms\nRefine current surveys and finalize questions\nMake sure the questions collect data that is easily comparable across all client\n\u00a0\nLong-Term\nEnd month-to-month contract with SurveyMonkey \n(2024)\nFully transition over to Microsoft Forms\nStandardize all surveys\n\u00a0\nBriza Cardenas\u00a0 \n(she/her)\nChief of Staff, Office of the CEO\nLCW\nWebsite\n\u00a0\n|\n\u00a0\nTwitter\n \n|\n\u00a0\nFacebook\n\u00a0\n|\n\u00a0\nLinkedIn\nView our upcoming events\n | \nSign-up for our newsletter",

What are the key choices and thoughtful compromises that must be made for workers to thrive as well as produce? How can managers be trained to make the well-being of their workers a top priority? How can companies get a better sense of which benefits and rewards are most effective\u2013and encourage workers to take advantage of them.\u00a0\nFeb. 14, 2024 - \nGetting to the Next Stage of Diversity and Belonging\u00a0\nAt a time of resistance and corporate austerity, DEI advocates will need to re-energize themselves and their organizations with new ideas, programs, and reasoning for the cause of diversity. What can DEI practitioners learn from companies with consistent success? How are companies changing their policies to respond to court rulings and lawsuits? What practices have brought the most progress in bringing diversity to leadership rank\n \nMarch 6, 2024 - \nEmployee Engagement: Tapping the Secrets of Energizing Workers\u00a0\nCompanies want their employees to be enthused and involved, yet employers need to be thoughtful in fostering these qualities in authentic ways. What\u2019s the latest thinking about how employers can understand the motivations of their workers\u2013and how to respond? What are the best methods for recognizing achievement, both individually and among teams? What\u2019s the connection between engagement and job satisfaction? In the hybrid work environment, what binds workers together and wards off anxiety and loneliness?\n \nApril 3, 2024 - \nBenefits that Fit Individual Needs Without Busting the Budge\nHaving made a commitment to recognize the unique needs of individuals, the secret is in the execution. What are the emerging benefits and rewards that workers are seeking, from fertility care to financial wellness? How can companies use technology to stay in close touch with what individuals are experiencing\u2013and where they need help as a result? How can companies choose among myriad point solutions and innovative new platforms? What are the most cost-effective rewards in terms of investments and outcomes\nMay 22, 2024 - \nThe Art and Science of Employee Retention, Coaching and Advancement\nWhile the pace of job-hopping has eased, employers have a powerful motivation to retain skilled workers, both for financial and cultural reasons. How can employers use new tools, including AI, to gain insights about what\u2019s inspiring their workers to stay committed\u2013or walk out the door? Since attrition is often caused by poor relationships with managers, what are innovative ways for employers to train their workers to be better leaders at a time when workers have higher expectations for job satisfaction? How can technology help make coaching more effective?\nJune 12, 2024 - \nBringing Talent Acquisition into the Digital Age\nDespite layoffs making headlines now, all the demographic and digital trends point toward tough competition for workers in the future\u2013maybe sooner than most expect. What are the new techniques and tools that talent-acquisition can use to envision the workforce their company will need in the future? What data and insights can HR and TA leaders provide to the company to be ahead of trends? How can companies do a better job of internal recruiting and promoting internal mobility? What are the best practices for hiring based on skills and potential, rather than credentials?\n\u00a0\nJuly 10, 2024 - \nLearning and Development: How New Tools Are Changing Upskilling and Career Mobility\u00a0\n\u00a0\n \nAs employers put more emphasis on skills as the currency for worker development, they\u2019re seeking new ways to measure them, fill in gaps, and predict the skills needed in the future. How can these new tools, including AI, create better matches between employees and projects? How can employers gain insights from the data they gather? Why do real-world simulations help measure certain skills better than traditional assessments?\u00a0\n\u00a0\nJuly 17, 2024 - \nInnovative Benefits That Support Healthy Families and Caregivers\n\u00a0\n \nAs the pandemic\u2019s caregiving crisis showed, employers found significant gaps in their support for the parents and other caregivers in their workforces. The resulting scramble to help has produced a wealth of new HR policies, benefit offerings, and management practices. Where is the greatest demand for support, as well as the most innovative new methods? What have been the most cost-effective ways to help caregivers of all kinds, including parents as well as \u201csandwich generation\u201d workers caring for elderly and disabled relatives?\u00a0\n\u00a0\nAug. 7, 2024 - \nEmployee Engagement: Using Technology to Gain Insight Into Work Needs and Ambitions \n\u00a0\nTraditional methods like town-hall meetings and surveys can be effective, but data and well-drawn insights can give top leaders a heads up about evolving patterns and trends in their workforces. How can AI and other technology be deployed in a way that brings new insights yet still respects privacy and the individual human factors at play? What approaches will bring employers new empathy for worker needs, ambitions, and well-being?\u00a0\n\u00a0\n \n\u00a0\nAug. 28, 2024 - \nPursuing Higher Productivity With Human Factors in Mind\n\u00a0\n \nIn a competitive and uncertain climate, most companies need to do more with less. Yet if workers are their greatest asset, employers need to make sure the push for greater output is sustainable. What is the latest thinking about how to measure productivity, the means for stimulating it, and ensuring that workers have the energy to meet their goals\u2013as well as thrive over the long run?\nSept. 18, 2024 - \nBuilding a Corporate Culture That Workers Can Understand, Influence and Embrace\u00a0\u00a0\nCompany culture is amorphous yet vital\u2013the shared beliefs, values, traditions and behaviors that drive the actions of individuals and the organization as a whole. Who should be the architects of a company\u2019s culture and how should it be designed and constructed? How should the culture be communicated, broadly and in everyday actions? How should a company start out on a project to evolve its culture in a credible way?\u00a0\u00a0\nOct. 16, 2024 - \nModernizing Your Workplace for a More Flexible, Inclusive Era\n\u00a0\n \nThe arrival of hybrid work sent virtually every employer back to the drawing board about what the workplace should look like, including floor plans, digital platforms, meetings, and even office furniture. After more than three years of experimenting, what have innovative companies discovered about what works\u2013and what doesn\u2019t? How have they improved workplace environments to be healthier, as well as more productive? How have these changes affected the goals of diversity, equity, inclusion, and belonging?\n\u00a0\n \nNov. 20, 2024 - \nFinding and Deploying HR Tech That Will Empower Workers\u00a0\u00a0\n\u00a0\n \nThe blossoming of innovation in HR technology has given employers untold new abilities to organize, inspire, develop, reward, and care for their workers. Yet this revolution presents new challenges for companies in choosing and supervising these tech tools. How should these tech platforms be evaluated? Which departments of the company should take responsibility\u2013and how can organizations coordinate these moves? How can companies make sure they\u2019re empowering their workers rather than overloading them with adaptation and distraction?\n\u00a0\n \nDec. 11, 2024 - \nPioneering Approaches to Digital Transformation and the Future of Work\n\u00a0\n \nThe emergence of generative AI in 2023 marked the arrival of a transforming technology that will change human roles, add and subtract jobs, and create astounding new capabilities. How can companies manage the transition, both from the short-term competitive pressures to\u00a0 long-term corporate survival? How can AI be used to unleash creativity? Where are the areas for abuse, intentional or otherwise? How will digital transformation affect fields from talent acquisition to learning and development?\u00a0\n\u00a0\n \n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\nMissy Morrison\u00a0\nFrom Day One\nwww.fromdayone.co",

To help with the final decision, a few of us have met and discussed this topic with a plan on the transition. \n\u00a0\nRecommendation:\n Cancel the SurveyMonkey subscription, but if we don\u2019t want to end it so soon, we can switch over to month to month for the remainder of the year to fully transition. \n\u00a0\nBelow are the three concerns folks expressed with canceling SurveyMonkey:\nPast data & reports - Kendall is downloading all data and saving it in Dropbox\nPost facilitation surveys - Consultants have piloted these surveys in MS Forms\nNPS survey - MS Forms has the same function as SurveyMonkey \n\u00a0\nCost:\n$900/year - SurveyMonkey\n$25/month for 1 seat - SurveyMonkey\nIncluded in Microsoft - MS Forms\n\u00a0\nSurveyMonkey only allows 3 seats, with Kendall owning verification codes and platform management\nMS Forms - Everyone has access to MS Forms and there will be no holdup getting codes or access to the platform\n\u00a0\nShort-Term\nKeep SurveyMonkey drop down seats, switch over to month-to month \n(3 months max),\n and only use as a back-up\nUpskill the staff on how to use MS Forms\nRefine current surveys and finalize questions\nMake sure the questions collect data that is easily comparable across all client\n\u00a0\nLong-Term\nEnd month-to-month contract with SurveyMonkey \n(2024)\nFully transition over to Microsoft Forms\nStandardize all surveys\n\u00a0\nBriza Cardenas\u00a0 \n(she/her)\nChief of Staff, Office of the CEO\nLCW\nWebsite\n\u00a0\n|\n\u00a0\nTwitter\n \n|\n\u00a0\nFacebook\n\u00a0\n|\n\u00a0\nLinkedIn\nView our upcoming events\n | \nSign-up for our newsletter",

As hiring picks up, especially for AI roles, how can TA leaders make the best use of the new technology, while also being on the alert for candidates using AI fraudulently during skills assessments?

This can present significant challenges for workers, who may have to undergo dialysis or other treatments, and for employers, who may face shockingly high-cost medical claims. This webinar will educate attendees about CKD and provide practical insights to address this condition within an employer's benefits strategy. You'll learn: the facts about CKD and dialysis care in the U.S., the financial implications for employers and workers, and benefits strategies to help address and manage the condition.\u00a0\nRegister now\n.\nWEBINAR\n \nSeptember 19:\u00a0Ageism in Industries\nAgeism remains the open secret in the advertising, marketing and branding categories. Subtle discrimination is vaguely disguised in commercials and employer branding, especially in the beauty and tech industries. Often times the About Us and Meet our Team landing pages can tell you more about a brand than the nicely polished imagery. If you\u2019re an organization that struggles to attract and retain experienced talent, join AARP Sr Advisor Heather Tinsley-Fix and New & Improved Principal Lisa Balser for a discussion on how ageism shows up in marketing and how employers can signal and implement a more inclusive culture.\u00a0\nRegister now\n.\nVIRTUAL CONFERENCE\n \nSeptember 20:\u00a0Building A Healthy Work Environment to Persevere Through Multiple Challenges\nOrganizations offering health care and wellness benefits maintain a stronger sense of employee loyalty. Yet health and well-being among employees goes beyond acute or specific physical or mental health needs. How can companies create a culture that emphasizes health through everyday experience? What are the hidden opportunities to nurture this kind of culture? Rather than relying only on standard \u00a0benefits to respond in times of unexpected distress, how can organizations address employee needs proactively?\u00a0\nRegister now\n.\nWEBINAR\n \nSeptember 21:\u00a0Manager Ratings Are Wrong: It\u2019s Time for a New Era of Fair, Data-Driven Performance Reviews\nPersonnel is a business\u2019s largest cost, so measuring performance is critical. But research shows that 60% of manager\u2019s ratings are based on their own idiosyncrasies. What can be done to make this critical measuring tool more accurate? Or are we doomed to performance reviews being a necessary evil?\u00a0\nRegister now\n.\nWEBINAR\n \nSeptember 25:\u00a0The Future of Employee Engagement and Social Good in Companies\nWe all know that empowering employees to create social impact\u2013whether it be through volunteering, giving, or general acts of kindness\u2013is good for business. So good, in fact, that a global survey conducted by Nielsen found that 66% of respondents were willing to pay more for products and services from companies committed to positive social and environmental impacts; a Harvard Business Review study found that companies with strong CSR programs experienced up to 50% lower employee-turnover rates compared to companies that did not prioritize CSR. As good as the benefits are, executing a successful social-impact program is becoming increasingly challenging because of rapid changes in the tools available, employee expectations, and restrictions on time. Our question: What is next for employee engagement and social good in companies? Our expert speakers will paint a picture of what the future looks like and what companies and leaders should be doing now to prepare.\u00a0\nRegister now\n.\nLIVE EVENT\n \nSeptember 26: Manhattan, New York\nIn an environment of constant workplace change, how can employers create a consistent community that builds enduring bonds of trust with workers?

In this interactive webinar, we\u2019ll explore how parents can make a more confident comeback to the workforce.

The main change I made in the document was to remove mention of MS Forms as the polling option because a warning window came up that said MS Forms moving forward will primarily be used as a survey instrument and not a chat/poll resource. \n\u00a0\nTeams Facilitation SOP:\n\u00a0\nEmani Richmond\n(she/her/hers)\nConsultant\nLCW\nWebsite\n\u00a0\n|\n\u00a0\nTwitter\n \n|\n\u00a0\nFacebook\n\u00a0\n|\n\u00a0\nLinkedIn\nView our upcoming events\n | \nSign-up for our newsletter\n\u00a0\nFrom:\n Kendall Washington <k.washington@lcwmail.com> \nSent:\n Tuesday, August 22, 2023 4:52 PM\nTo:\n Emani Richmond <e.richmond@lcwmail.com>\nSubject:\n Teams Doc\n\u00a0\nHey,\n\u00a0\nHere\u2019s a start.

However, I do have a lingering concern. The billable work for Translation isn't accurate, as only Diligent is listed. We're missing entries for all the translation clients, such as Alliant and Catalent. Although I recorded all that work under Diligent for my own timekeeping and reference, I believe this needs to be corrected.\nFurthermore, I noticed that each Statement of Work (SOW) is properly listed for the consultants, allowing them to track their time effectively for each project. We lack this breakdown for translation. Currently, all billables are lumped under Diligent's general category, with no distinction by translation client or SOW (Scoro Quote number). Please let me know who I should reach out to enter more billable categories for translation. I will be happy to enter them as well each time a project is approved after quoting. \n\u00a0\nMaria Fagrelius\nDirector of Global Language Solutions\nLCW\n\u00a0\nWebsite\n\u00a0\n|\n\u00a0\nTwitter\n \n|\n\u00a0\nFacebook\n\u00a0\n|\n\u00a0\nLinkedIn\nView our upcoming events\n | \nSign-up for our newsletter\n\u00a0\nFrom:\n Chuck Adams <\nc.adams@lcwmail.com\n> \nSent:\n Friday, August 18, 2023 10:06 AM\nTo:\n Maria Fagrelius <\nm.fagrelius@lcwmail.com\n>\nSubject:\n RE: Clockify - UPDATE\n\u00a0\nLet\u2019s chat next week.\n\u00a0\nHere are the categories:\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\nChuck Adams\n \n(He/Him)\nCo-CEO and Managing Principal\nLCW\nOffice: \n+1.773.938.4285\nMobile: +1.630.373.5068\n\u00a0\nWebsite\n\u00a0\n|\n\u00a0\nTwitter\n \n|\n\u00a0\nFacebook\n\u00a0\n|\n\u00a0\nLinkedIn\nView our upcoming events\n | \nSign-up for our newsletter\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\nFrom:\n Maria Fagrelius <\nm.fagrelius@lcwmail.com\n> \nSent:\n Friday, August 18, 2023 7:53 AM\nTo:\n Chuck Adams <\nc.adams@lcwmail.com\n>\nSubject:\n RE: Clockify - UPDATE\n\u00a0\nHappy Friday, Chuck!\nThank you for the reminder. I will be happy to start \"clokifying\" my hours next week.

How should I clockify all these proposals from this week (as shown in the screenshot below)? Do I need to get in touch with Kendall to have them entered?

    "body": "Dear Valued Customer, \nDue to the U.S. holiday weekend \nwe are moving the JSON Web Token (JWT) app type retirement to Sept. 8 for all customers\n. For details on how to navigate this change, please review our \nJWT deprecation guide\n. If you are not using the JWT app type in Zoom Marketplace then no action is required.\u00a0\nNOTE: Our online documentation is currently in the process of being updated to reflect the new deprecation date of Sept 8. \nOn Sept. 8, Zoom will start the phased deactivation of JWT apps across all customer accounts. Due to the large number of accounts impacted it could take several days before your JWT app is deactivated. You will be notified by email when the deactivation occurs in your account.\nTo avoid disruption, you must migrate \nto a Server-to-Server or OAuth implementation\n before Sept. 8.\u00a0\u00a0\nFor instructions on how to migrate specific integrations, please see the guides below:\u00a0 \nAzure SCIM\nSalesforce for Zoom App\nEpic\n and \nEpic FHIR\nZoom Rooms JSON RPC API\nIf you are currently using a third-party integration that uses JWT and is not listed above, we recommend reaching out to the developer for more information on their migration plan.\u00a0\nYou have the ability to remove a JWT app from your account. If you\u2019re actively using the JWT app type, we recommend following these steps before you consider removing the JWT app:\nReview the call logs for your JWT app\n.\nFollow the \nmigration guide\n, or the \ninstructional webinar\n to migrate your apps.\nWhen your apps have been migrated, or if you believe there will be no business impact, we recommend that you deactivate your JWT app for a period of time. The JWT app can be reactivated if necessary.\nWhen you\u2019re confident the JWT app is no longer needed you can remove the app from your account. Removing the app will permanently delete it from your account.\n\u26a0\ufe0f IMPORTANT: There is no way to recover/restore the JWT app once it\u2019s been removed. \u26a0\ufe0f\u00a0\nFor any additional questions, please see the \nJWT migration guide\n, \nJWT deprecation FAQ\n or you can reach out to our \ndeveloper advocacy or support teams\n.\n\u200b\u200b\u200b\u200b\u200b\nTeam Zoom \n\u00a0\nCatch us on social \n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\nVisit \nzoom.us\n1-888-799-9666\n55 Almaden Blvd., San Jose, CA 95113\n\u00a9 2023 Zoom - All Rights Reserved \n\u00a0\n\u00a0\nClick \nhere\n to unsubscribe from this list or manage your preferences \nhere\n.",

I would HIGHLY encourage for each person to revisit each of these Microlearnings over the next two weeks and see how these subjects can work to diversify your asset offerings for your client\u2019s Learning Journey. If you have any questions, concerns, or ideas, please send them my way. \n\u00a0\nOur recent collaborations with Ralph Lauren reminded us how these assets can be strategically \u201ccustomized\u201d for clients for maximum $ while capturing their company culture using image swaps and color branding. If you would like to analyze any course and it\u2019s client solution possibilities, feel free to schedule a meeting with me. We can do a deeper dive on any singular course to improve our overall generic version or chat strategies for customizing to client needs. \n\u00a0\nYou can find these links also in the Resources for Consultants within Teams.\n\u00a0\nMICROLEARNINGS\n\u00a0\nUsername:\u00a0\ntest@lcwmail.com\u00a0\nExpiration Date (for all below links):\u00a0\n12/31/2023\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\nManaging Bias in Performance Reviews\n\u00a0\nhttps://app.cloud.scorm.com/sc/InvitationConfirmEmail?publicInvitationId=3c9eeb1e-3d2b-4494-8163-b9ff1283b75c\n\u00a0\nIn this short\u00a0(10-15 minute) course\n,\n\u00a0you\u2019ll learn how to become more aware of personal biases so that we can attend to them and interrupt them while evaluating our team members\u2019 performance and conducting performance reviews.\u00a0\u00a0\nManaging Bias in Talent Reviews\n\u00a0\nhttps://app.cloud.scorm.com/sc/InvitationConfirmEmail?publicInvitationId=bf8f5de8-98ae-478b-9a71-6269d1e8e9d2\n\u00a0\nIn this short\u00a0(10-15 minute) course\n,\n\u00a0you\u2019ll learn ways to reduce your bias in the talent review process so that you can promote diversity, inclusion, and objectivity, and mitigate unconscious bias that may be hampering your best intentions when it comes to reviewing talent.\u00a0\u00a0\nManaging Bias in Hiring\n\u00a0\nhttps://app.cloud.scorm.com/sc/InvitationConfirmEmail?publicInvitationId=09ace2b6-9d23-4039-981f-06c46182d5c6\n\u00a0\nThis short\u00a0(10-15 minute)\n\u00a0\ncourse allows us to become aware of our biases so that we can attend to them and interrupt them while evaluating and selecting diverse top talent.\u00a0\nManaging Bias in Interviewing\n\u00a0\nhttps://app.cloud.scorm.com/sc/InvitationConfirmEmail?publicInvitationId=fe85349c-cb6a-4bf7-85dc-d99f3e912840\n\u00a0\nIn this short\u00a0(10-15 minute) course\n,\n\u00a0you\u2019ll learn ways to mitigate unconscious biases during job interviews, so that you can promote diversity, inclusion, and objectivity and mitigate biases that may be undermining your best intentions when it comes to interviewing job candidates.\u00a0\u00a0\nManaging Bias in Recruiting\n\u00a0\nhttps://app.cloud.scorm.com/sc/InvitationConfirmEmail?publicInvitationId=f1332bc6-0368-472e-a986-7fd93616f071\n\u00a0\nIn this short\u00a0(10-15 minute) course, you\u2019ll learn ways to mitigate unconscious biases during the talent sourcing and recruitment process, so that you can find and recognize diverse top talent more effectively.\u00a0\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\nBest,\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\nDustin Puehler\nSenior Manager of Multimedia Development\nLCW\n\u00a0\nWebsite\n\u00a0\n|\n\u00a0\nTwitter\n \n|\n\u00a0\nFacebook\n\u00a0\n|\n\u00a0\nLinkedIn\nView our upcoming events\n | \nSign-up for our newsletter",

There\u2019s a lot of work behind \nscreens\n scenes to be done - plus essential skills to learn along the way.\nWe\u2019re here to provide simple practices you can use to deliver the best meeting experience. One step at a time. \nHow to include remote attendees? \ud83d\udc65\nTry to keep a remote-first mindset. Address questions towards them first, include them in the conversation and make sure they hear everyone present in the room. Master the hybrid setup with our \n22 tips\n.\nHow to keep the discussion on point? \ud83d\udde3\nYou might not be aware of your attendee's expectations. To find out what people want to focus on and to make your meetings more democratic, run a \nranking poll\n with the proposed agenda topics.\nI've launched my poll, now what? \ud83e\udd14\nGive attendees time before going through the results. Read aloud some of the submissions and ask volunteers to share insights regarding their answers. Some days people won\u2019t want to speak up, and that's okay. You can always use the submissions as a bridge to your next point within the meeting.\nTo see \ncommenting in action\n, check out the recording from our \nThe Art of Meeting Facilitation\n webinar. \ud83c\udfa5\n \nStart with an icebreaker\nThey help energize people, drive lively discussions and encourage participants to be more active throughout the meeting. \nGet inspired\n.\nPrepare your Slido\n \nWhat to watch out for\nAwkward silence\n \ud83d\ude30\nGive your audience time to process information. You can use those pauses to comment on poll results or encourage the less vocal participants to speak up and join the discussion.\nAttendees' attention span\n \ud83d\ude34\nIs everyone keeping up? A rating poll will help to understand where you stand and confidently move through your agenda.\nOverloaded slides\n \u2696\ufe0f\nMake sure your slides are not too content-heavy.

    "subject": "From Day One: The Great Moderation",
    "body": "As the months of 2023 have ticked by, the Great Resignation has quietly lost something: its greatness. The worker resignation rate in June fell to 2.4%, essentially returning to where it was in June 2019. For employers who had been in a war for talent, the dramatic lack of turnover has brought welcome relief. But what does that mean for workers, who in 2020-22 enjoyed a wealth of new benefits, job flexibility, and employer concern about their well-being? Will employers start taking workers for granted?\n\u00a0\nWhile HR experts say that most employers won\u2019t be inclined to turn the clock back to 2019, workers will see a more miserly approach. In terms of total rewards, you could call it the Great Moderation. \u201cEmployee retention at all costs\u2013in terms of very high salaries; PTO and other employee perks\u2013is over,\u201d Janine Yancey, CEO of the corporate-culture platform \nEmtrain\n, told From Day One. While she believes that job flexibility and pay equity are here to stay, \u201cwe\u2019re moving into a time of scarcity, not abundance, which impacts the employee experience.\u201d\n\u00a0\nWe're working with AARP to increase age inclusion, and we need your help. Please fill out \nthis very short, three-question survey\n to let us know what actions your organization is undertaking or wants to undertake to support workers of all ages.\n\u00a0\nThe Great Resignation\u2019s obituary was written earlier this month, when the management professor who coined the term in 2021, Anthony Klotz,\n told \nFast Company\n, \u201cI believe the Great Resignation has largely come to an end.\u201d Added Klotz, who is now a professor at University College London\u2019s School of Management: \u201cThe backlog of quitting has certainly cleared.\u201d\n\u00a0\nWhy They\u2019re Staying\n\u00a0\nEmployee surveys indicate that workers are motivated to stay in their jobs by a mixture of caution and the need for a calm stretch of time. The massive layoffs early in the pandemic, followed by the wave of austerity-inspired layoffs in the last year, have made workers less inclined to be job-hopping if they trust their situation.\n\u00a0\nAt the same time, they're overdue for some R and R for the sake of their sanity. \u201cWe are now in a time when stability and routine are supporting mental-health needs as many recover from the shock of unplanned life/work changes,\u201d Laura Sewell, EVP of North American HR for the IT services consultancy \nAvanade\n, told From Day One. \u201cIt has only been in the past 12 to 18 months that more and more people have begun planning vacations, events, and other activities which were put on hold during the pandemic. Having access to paid time off through their employer offers them both the time they need and the financial backing to finally take those trips and plan the events.\u201d\n\u00a0\nWhy Employers Are Tightening Up\n\u00a0\nThe combination of high interest rates and slow economic growth have inspired companies to clamp down on spending as well as hiring. \u201c2023 has been the year of massive downsizing across the board,\u201d observes Yancey. \u201cCapital is scarce and capital fuels business growth, so that will impact job growth. Businesses are focused on showing profitability first and foremost.\u201d\n\u00a0\nHow will the austerity mindset affect employee benefits? That issue has caused tension between finance departments and HR leaders who just recently had been working overtime to create new incentives to attract and retain employees, including programs to support worker well-being and family caregiving. \u201cWe\u2019re in this constant battle with finance,\u201d said Ken Wechsler, VP of total rewards at Akamai Technologies, in a recent From Day One webinar on employee benefits. \u201cWe\u2019re fighting for it, and I guess my colleagues on this call will also fight it.\u201d\n\u00a0\nWhich Workplace Improvements Will Endure\n\u00a0\nPart of the reason for low turnover right now, Avanade\u2019s Sewell points out, is the enhanced working conditions that were inspired by the hardships of the pandemic. \u201cOver the past three years, inclusion and well-being have rocketed to the top of our people priorities. With this increased focus, employees are feeling better supported at work, have access to more resources and benefits to take care of themselves, and in general, most have greater flexibility in how and where they get their work done.\u201d\n\u00a0\nDespite well-publicized efforts by some major employers, notably in finance, to bring workers back to the office for a majority of the workweek, job flexibility is a value that has become well-embedded in the expectations of most workers. Asserted Emtrain\u2019s Yancey: \u201cI believe the need for job flexibility is here to stay and employer's obligation to create jobs with pay equity and a healthy, inclusive work culture is here to stay.\u201d\n\u00a0\nSo is the inclination for workers to negotiate their terms. \u201cEverything is in play now\u00ad\u2013things I had never even thought of when it comes to total rewards,\u201d said Akamai\u2019s Wechsler. \u201cWe give employees the choice of where they want to work, and 90% of them have said they want to work from home.\u201d\u00a0\u00a0\n\u00a0\nTrying to Reach an Equilibrium\n\u00a0\nWhile turnover may be low at the moment, forward-looking employers know that future job shortages driven by an aging population and new attitudes toward work mean that they can\u2019t forget the lessons learned during the Great Resignation. \u201cIt\u2019s a new culture of work,\u201d behavioral scientist Laurel McKenzie told \nFast Company\n\u2019s AJ Hess. \u201cNo one\u2019s staying at organizations for years and years. People are willing to leave and find something better. There\u2019s not a sense of loyalty to organizations anymore. People are more focused on taking care of themselves and finding organizations that will enable that.\u201d\n\u00a0\nAvanade\u2019s Sewell says her company keeps close tabs on surveys to pick up on trends in employee sentiment. \u201cOur goal is to maintain the hearts and minds of our employees through all of the ups and downs and be prepared for what is ahead. By building loyalty now, we are creating a stronger foundation for whatever wave comes next.\u201d\n\u00a0\nIn a book to be published next month,\n \nThe Retention Revolution: 7 Surprising (and Very Human!) Ways to Keep Employees Connected to Your Company\n, workplace strategist and bestselling author Erica Keswin calls for a new paradigm in thinking about the relationship between workers and employers, as well as career pathways \u201cThe time is now to reconsider everything we know about the employee journey and why linear thinking is being replaced by the more human reality of cycles, revolving doors, and dynamic change.\u201d \nRead the full story here\n.\n\u00a0 \nFEATURE\n\u00a0 \nOlder Workers and Technology: How They Approach It With a Different Mindset: \nKaren Fleshman is a 54-year-old CEO of a small\n workshop-facilitation company\n based in the world\u2019s tech capital, the San Francisco Bay Area. Recently, a potential client approached her about creating some anti-harassment videos, but before they would award her company the contract, they wanted to see a sample. Fleshman\u2019s expertise is content, not tech. To win the job, she would need to deliver both. \u201cI was like, \u2018Oh God, this is not something I can record on my phone,\u201d said Fleshman. \u201cI\u2019m really going to have to work to make this look up to their standards.\u201d Video creation and artificial intelligence is new territory for Fleshman\u2014for the project, she\u2019s teaching herself Descript, Loom, StreamYard, and Beautiful.ai\u2014but resourcefulness comes naturally. \nRead the full story here\n.\n\u00a0 \nLIVE CONFERENCE HIGHLIGHTS\n\u00a0 \nFrom Recruitment to Advancement: How to Keep Momentum Going on Diversity and Inclusion: \n84% of CHROs say that their organizations are increasing investment in diversity, equity, inclusion, and belonging (DEIB) initiatives. But only 31% of employees say that their organization is committed to improving equity in the workplace, according to a Gallup poll conducted in the spring of 2022. Workplace diversity is experiencing a disconnect.

Doing what\u2019s right plays out in how the company treats its employees, called \u201cpartners,\u201d as well as suppliers and customers. Harris spoke with Dan Goodgame, editor in chief of \nTexas Monthly\n, in a fireside chat at From Day One\u2019s \nAustin conference\n. \nRead the full story here\n.\u00a0\n\u00a0\nPutting Talent Where It\u2019s Needed: Companies Search Internally to Find Ways to Close Skills Gaps: \nWhen \nUSAA\n\u2019s Head of Talent Marketplace Lya Icaza reflects on her early career, she remembers being advised not to mention her family heritage in the workplace. Icaza and a panel of four other female leaders used their experiences and business knowledge to highlight how companies can better foster career growth among employees during the \nAustin conference\n. \u201c[In previous workplaces,] if I had gone to my leader and said, \u2018Hey, I think I want to go work for somebody else,\u2019 then [I\u2019d be] terminated tomorrow,\u201d said Ramona Arora, chief learning officer and VPof global talent and development at \nDell\n. \u201cThat talent-hoarding mentality, that's part of a culture.\u201d A culture that all five women were happy to report is becoming increasingly scarce in the 21st century. \nRead the full story here\n.\u00a0\n\u00a0 \nVIRTUAL EVENT HIGHLIGHTS\n\u00a0 \nMaking Health and Well-Being a Priority for Workers and Their Families: \nImagine going to your employer for bereavement time to process the loss of a loved one and being denied. At \nNorthwell Health\n, this wouldn\u2019t happen. Their bereavement policy is more inclusive than other more traditional approaches, thanks to the organization\u2019s broader commitment to the health and well-being of its diverse workforce. Northwell Health is a nonprofit, integrated network that is New York State's largest healthcare provider and private employer, with more than 81,000 employees. At \nFrom Day One\u2019s July virtual conference\n on family health, Gregg Nevola, VP and chief rewards officer at Northwell Health, detailed the organization\u2019s policies. \nRead the full story here\n.\u00a0\n\u00a0\nBridging the Distance: How Tech Can Boost Engagement and Recognition: \nPicture an all-hands meeting with hundreds of employees, and a team leader singling out a shy employee to congratulate them\u2013but totally horrifying them in the process! If only the manager had known, they could have rewarded the employee in a way that made them feel comfortable.

How can employers make it better? \u201cParents will tell me, I don\u2019t need pity, I don\u2019t need sympathy,\u201d said Angela Nelson, executive director of clinical services at \nRethinkCare\n, a virtual platform for behavior and mental health needs. What they do need, she says, is flexibility, reassurance, and recognition.

Workers at one cafe after the next voted to unionize\u2013more than 330 of its thousands of locations so far. Their demands include better pay ($20 an hour minimum for baristas, with annual raises), fair and consistent scheduling, and easier access to the benefits that Starbucks executives have always touted. In this context, \nThe New York Times \nreports, a Nottingham, Md., Starbucks voted to join Starbucks Workers United in June 2022\u2013and Agnes Torregoza and her colleagues stepped into a world of trouble.

Still, the U.S. lacks the infrastructure to support caregivers and is the only industrial nation without federal paid parental leave. Many people live in \nchildcare deserts\n. Given these shortcomings and the fact that \n73% of U.S. employees\n are caregivers, in order to have a productive and sustainable workforce, companies must create the \ninfrastructure\n to support them. Not supporting caregivers results in high turnover, lost institutional knowledge, and absenteeism. \nHarvard Business Review \npublished research that shows how caregivers bring skills that improve culture, retention, and the bottom line. \nRead the full story here\n.\u00a0\n\u00a0\nDo Oddball Questions Help Companies Find the Best New Hires?

Bach, 23, is a student of his contemporaries in his role as the client engagement manager for \nRegenerate\n, a training and consulting firm that leverages the science of human energy to help leaders work and live more sustainably. While generational labels don\u2019t apply to everyone, Gen Z, \ngenerally defined\n as those born between 1997 and 2012, has acquired a reputation for \nseveral defining characteristics\n.

Branch became a self-taught coder by spending her free time on a computer in the library of her high school. In her explorations, Branch not only accidentally broke into Maryland\u2019s Board of Education database but also discovered her knack for coding. Branch\u2019s path to success proved that not all skills need to be learned from a textbook or professor. In the webinar \u201c\nAttracting Non-traditional and Diverse Talent\n,\u201d moderator Jonathan Pride, executive director of \nNPower\n, spoke with Branch and other leaders on how tech workers can break from the traditional career path and how employers attract skilled talent in the current market. \nRead the full story here\n.\u00a0\n\u00a0\nDDI\n\u00a0\nThe Evolving Role of Leaders in Enhancing Employee Engagement: \nLots of companies talk about well-being, but many don\u2019t follow through in a tangible way. Rosey Rhyne, senior research manager at \nDDI\n, a global leadership-development firm, recommends that leaders should walk the walk\u2013sometimes literally. \u201cFor a leader, showing how they prioritize wellness could mean saying, \u2018I\u2019m going for a walk to clear my head after this busy morning.\u2019 It\u2019s about doing little things where well-being is a priority that is being communicated,\u201d said Rhyne. \u201cDoing that really shows vulnerability, too.\u201d Showing vulnerability helps build \ntrust\n, an intangible yet crucial aspect of leadership. According to DDI\u2019s recently published \nGlobal Leadership Forecast 2023\n, when leaders regularly display vulnerability, employees are five times more likely to trust them. From Day One talked with Rhyne, who contributed to the research, to learn more. \nRead the full story here\n.\u00a0\n\u00a0\n15FIVE\n\u00a0\nManager Effectiveness as the Path to Individual and Organizational Success: \n\u201cPeople don\u2019t quit companies, they quit managers.\u201d Adam Bouse, manager of performance coaching at \n15Five\n, often hears this saying in business circles. But he\u2019d amend that quote: \u201cPeople don\u2019t quit companies, they quit managers who haven\u2019t been set up to succeed,\u201d he said during \nFrom Day One\u2019s July virtual conference.\n Bouse spoke on manager effectiveness as the path to individual and organizational success. While it\u2019s not uncommon for employees to criticize direct superiors due to unsatisfactory work conditions, Bouse said 15Five looks higher up the ladder to help reverse negative trends such as voluntary turnover. \u201cThe majority of managers want to be good at their job,\u201d he said. \u201cMost managers come in with the best intentions.

Thanks to these new technologies, employers are now able to cast a wider net when they need to, as well as create an effective screen when they have an abundance of candidates. For employers, what are the steps toward modernizing their approach? What benefits can they expect to see in both early career and experienced recruiting approaches? And how can HR practitioners \nreally \ndo more with less to hit their hiring goals while strengthening the human experiences for candidates and new hires? \nRegister now\n.\u00a0\n\u00a0\nAug. 24: The Economic Impact of Family-Care Support: A Case Study. \nWhat is the value of a well-designed family care program for all employees? With diverse, multi-generational workforces, many companies are now seeing the need to support their entire population with more personalized family care\u2013and seeking data to make the case and measure value. In this fireside chat, we\u2019ll explore the path taken by Okta, a $2 billion identity-security company, to provide inclusive, global family care for its 6,000 employees. You\u2019ll hear firsthand about the company\u2019s goals, what its leaders learned, and how they measured and demonstrated value. \nRegister now\n.\u00a0\n\u00a0\nAug. 29: The Benefits of Sleep Care: Curbing the Progression and Costs of Multiple Chronic Conditions. \nTroubled sleep among employees may not seem as urgent to address as heart disease, hypertension, or diabetes. But what\u2019s often overlooked is that lack of sleep is a major aggravator of chronic conditions, worsening the outlook for patients and driving up total health care costs. People with sleep disorders cost three times more for their health care than people without them. For example, 9 out 10 people with sleep apnea also have one or more simultaneous chronic conditions. While troubled sleep is often a hidden issue, the care gap it creates can be bridged with effective sleep health management. Traditional programs typically don\u2019t work, but this webinar will show how a value-based program puts the patient in the center of care, improving their health outcome, lowering costs, and reducing wasted effort. You\u2019ll learn how lasting patient results can be delivered through multidisciplinary teamwork and an outcomes-focused, clinically integrated delivery system. \nRegister now\n.\u00a0\n\u00a0\nSept. 13: Using AI to Revolutionize Hiring for Top Talent, While Avoiding the Pitfalls. \nFor talent acquisition, AI presents a remarkable tool that can help by verifying candidates\u2019 backgrounds and skills, suggesting interview questions, creating candidate profiles, and other tasks. As tech hiring picks up, especially for AI roles, how can TA leaders make the best use of the new technology, while also being on the alert for candidates using AI fraudulently during skills assessments? How can TA specialists use AI to solve many of their pain points, while continuing to focus on the aspects of the job that require the human touch? \nRegister now\n.\u00a0\n\u00a0\nSept. 14: What Employers Need to Know About Chronic Kidney Disease: Its Rising Prevalence, Its High Cost, and How to Manage It. \nChronic kidney disease (CKD) has become increasingly common, affecting one in seven U.S. adults, yet most people won't know they have it until it has reached an advanced stage. This can present significant challenges for workers, who may have to undergo dialysis or other treatments, and for employers, who may face shockingly high-cost medical claims. This webinar will educate attendees about CKD and provide practical insights to address this condition within an employer\u2019s benefits strategy. You'll learn the facts about CKD and dialysis care in the U.S., the financial implications for employers and workers, and benefits strategies to help address and manage the condition. \nRegister now\n.\u00a0\n\u00a0\nSept. 19: Ageism in Industries. \nAgeism remains the open secret in the advertising, marketing, and branding categories. Subtle discrimination is vaguely disguised in commercials and employer branding, especially in the beauty and tech industries. Often the About Us and Meet our Team landing pages can tell you more about a brand than the nicely polished imagery. If you\u2019re an organization that struggles to attract and retain experienced talent, join AARP Senior Advisor Heather Tinsley-Fix and New & Improved Principal Lisa Balser for a discussion on how ageism shows up in marketing and how employers can signal and implement a more inclusive culture. They\u2019ll cover age discrimination trends and how they adversely affect an organization\u2019s strategic goals; the silent signals of ageism in your organization, from client-facing work to internal workflows and decisions; and strategies to become more age-inclusive, not just in your marketing strategy but in creating teams. \nRegister now\n.\u00a0\n\u00a0\nSept. 21: Manager Ratings Are Wrong: It\u2019s Time for a New Era of Fair, Data-Driven Performance Reviews. \nPersonnel is a business\u2019s largest cost, so measuring performance is critical. But research shows that 60% of managers' ratings are based on their own idiosyncrasies. What can be done to make this critical measuring tool more accurate? Or are we doomed to performance reviews being a necessary evil? \nRegister now\n.\n\u00a0\nSept. 25: The Future of Employee Engagement and Social Good in Companies. \nWe all know that empowering employees to create social impact\u2013whether it be through volunteering, giving, or general acts of kindness\u2013is good for business. So good, in fact, that a global survey conducted by Nielsen found that 66% of respondents were willing to pay more for products and services from companies committed to positive social and environmental impacts. AHarvard Business Review study found that companies with strong CSR programs experienced up to 50% lower employee-turnover rates compared to companies that did not prioritize CSR. As good as the benefits are, executing a successful social-impact program is becoming increasingly challenging because of rapid changes in the tools available, employee expectations, and restrictions on time. Our question: What is next for employee engagement and social good in companies? Our expert speakers will paint a picture of what the future looks like and what companies and leaders should be doing now to prepare. \nRegister now\n.\u00a0\n\u00a0\nSept. 28: Helping Working Parents Make a Confident Comeback.\u00a0\nAfter parental leave, a working parent\u2019s return to the workforce can be a daunting experience. As they adjust to their new roles as parents and professionals, their self-assurance can lapse and stress can rise. In this interactive webinar, we\u2019ll explore how parents can make a more confident comeback to the workforce. We\u2019ll cover topics such as saying good-bye to the elusive work-life balance and instead embracing \u201clife meets work\u201d; establishing and enforcing healthy boundaries that support well-being and self-efficacy; planning for career progression after parental leave; and how leaders can foster a truly family-friendly work culture. \nRegister now\n.\n\u00a0\nOct. 10: Why Women\u2019s Health Benefits Are Essential to Retention. \nWomen\u2019s health can be a high cost driver for employers. Additionally, offering solutions to improve and support needs specific to women can also be an important factor to retention. But women\u2019s health in general is not just one condition. Join us for this fireside chat in which Dr. Leslie Saltzman, Ovia Health\u2019s chief medical officer, explains the different facets of women\u2019s health (like menopause, fertility, and maternity care management), what areas generate the most ROI, and how employers can offer the deepest, and most all-encompassing benefits to support and delight their employees and medically supported dependents. \nRegister now\n.\u00a0\n\u00a0\nNov. 9: Bridging the Distance: How Tech Can Boost Engagement and Recognition.\n In a distributed workforce, how can employers promote both team cohesion and making individual employees feel \u201cseen\u201d by their managers and peers?

This is regarding FleishmanHillard and SOWs 2022-53 and 2021-168 and two Fostering Inclusive Leadership sessions.\n\u00a0\nThe initial SOW for these two sessions was 2022-53; however, when invoiced, the payment was sent with the PO for SOW 2021-168. Now both of these sessions are listed in Compass under both SOWs. I\u2019m not sure why they are showing up in SOW 2021-168, but I am assuming that it is somehow connected to the billing error (that I made\u2026I think).\n\u00a0\nSo based upon Compass, it shows payment for 4 sessions; but in reality, it is only two sessions. What is the best way to correct this in Compass?\n\u00a0\nTamara\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\nTamara Thorpe\n(she/her)\nPrincipal Consultant\nLCW\nWebsite\n\u00a0\n|\n\u00a0\nTwitter\n \n|\n\u00a0\nFacebook\n\u00a0\n|\n\u00a0\nLinkedIn\nView our upcoming events\n | \nSign-up for our newsletter",

This is regarding FleishmanHillard and SOWs 2022-53 and 2021-168 and two Fostering Inclusive Leadership sessions.\n\u00a0\nThe initial SOW for these two sessions was 2022-53; however, when invoiced, the payment was sent with the PO for SOW 2021-168. Now both of these sessions are listed in Compass under both SOWs. I\u2019m not sure why they are showing up in SOW 2021-168, but I am assuming that it is somehow connected to the billing error (that I made\u2026I think).\n\u00a0\nSo based upon Compass, it shows payment for 4 sessions; but in reality, it is only two sessions. What is the best way to correct this in Compass?\n\u00a0\nTamara\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\nTamara Thorpe\n(she/her)\nPrincipal Consultant\nLCW\nWebsite\n\u00a0\n|\n\u00a0\nTwitter\n \n|\n\u00a0\nFacebook\n\u00a0\n|\n\u00a0\nLinkedIn\nView our upcoming events\n | \nSign-up for our newsletter",

I don\u2019t see a 2022-53. \nDid they already pay for any of the sessions?\n\u00a0\nFrom:\n Tamara Thorpe <t.thorpe@lcwmail.com> \nSent:\n Tuesday, August 15, 2023 4:32 PM\nTo:\n Antonio Jones <a.jones@lcwmail.com>; Kendall Washington <k.washington@lcwmail.com>\nCc:\n Vince Bongiovanni <v.bongiovanni@lcwmail.com>; Daniel Gough <d.gough@lcwmail.com>\nSubject:\n FH in Compass\n\u00a0\nHello Toni and Kendall,\n\u00a0\nI think this is primarily a Compass tech issue but since the correction may have billing implications I\u2019m messaging you both. This is regarding FleishmanHillard and SOWs 2022-53 and 2021-168 and two Fostering Inclusive Leadership sessions.\n\u00a0\nThe initial SOW for these two sessions was 2022-53; however, when invoiced, the payment was sent with the PO for SOW 2021-168. Now both of these sessions are listed in Compass under both SOWs. I\u2019m not sure why they are showing up in SOW 2021-168, but I am assuming that it is somehow connected to the billing error (that I made\u2026I think).\n\u00a0\nSo based upon Compass, it shows payment for 4 sessions; but in reality, it is only two sessions. What is the best way to correct this in Compass?\n\u00a0\nTamara\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\nTamara Thorpe\n(she/her)\nPrincipal Consultant\nLCW\nWebsite\n\u00a0\n|\n\u00a0\nTwitter\n \n|\n\u00a0\nFacebook\n\u00a0\n|\n\u00a0\nLinkedIn\nView our upcoming events\n | \nSign-up for our newsletter",

This is regarding FleishmanHillard and SOWs 2022-53 and 2021-168 and two Fostering Inclusive Leadership sessions.\n\u00a0\nThe initial SOW for these two sessions was 2022-53; however, when invoiced, the payment was sent with the PO for SOW 2021-168. Now both of these sessions are listed in Compass under both SOWs. I\u2019m not sure why they are showing up in SOW 2021-168, but I am assuming that it is somehow connected to the billing error (that I made\u2026I think).\n\u00a0\nSo based upon Compass, it shows payment for 4 sessions; but in reality, it is only two sessions. What is the best way to correct this in Compass?\n\u00a0\nTamara\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\nTamara Thorpe\n(she/her)\nPrincipal Consultant\nLCW\nWebsite\n\u00a0\n|\n\u00a0\nTwitter\n \n|\n\u00a0\nFacebook\n\u00a0\n|\n\u00a0\nLinkedIn\nView our upcoming events\n | \nSign-up for our newsletter",

The folks highlighted in red no longer need a license. They folks highlighted in yellow don\u2019t either, but I want to make sure their inbox can still go to their manager. I added a column (column A) with the name of the person their inbox should be transferred to. \n\u00a0\nShould we schedule another meeting next week to talk through the pricing, what we were paying vs. what we will be paying after the changes, etc.?\n\u00a0\nI also reached out to Jake today and he said he never received a FedEx box and he still has his laptop.

I can typically get you a discount on all licensing, except for teams voice licensing (I\u2019m sure that will change soon and I\u2019ll let you know when it does). For business premium licensing it\u2019s $264 annually if you buy it from Microsoft and I resell it for $252/annually. On pretty much any annual license I can offer 5% discount. If you go through the attached list and maybe highlight in red those people who do not need a license I can go through the process of removing licenses and make sure the LCW credit card on file with Microsoft no longer gets charged unnecessarily. Also, I talked with the team and moving from lcwmail.com to lcwinclusion.com or whatever domain you choose would involve a full email migration. It would be something we\u2019d do over a weekend and would have minimal impact on the users. We can definitely assist you with that and typical guidance is to budget an hour per mailbox.\n\u00a0\nAlso I can see that the box was delivered to Jake via Fedex, tracking number 781059794350 but it doesn\u2019t look like he\u2019s sent it back, tracking number 791373600964\n\u00a0\nThanks! \n\u00a0\nElijah J.

I can typically get you a discount on all licensing, except for teams voice licensing (I\u2019m sure that will change soon and I\u2019ll let you know when it does). For business premium licensing it\u2019s $264 annually if you buy it from Microsoft and I resell it for $252/annually. On pretty much any annual license I can offer 5% discount. If you go through the attached list and maybe highlight in red those people who do not need a license I can go through the process of removing licenses and make sure the LCW credit card on file with Microsoft no longer gets charged unnecessarily. Also, I talked with the team and moving from lcwmail.com to lcwinclusion.com or whatever domain you choose would involve a full email migration.

    "body": "Hello, \n\u00a0\u00a0Here\u2019s a list of everyone\u2019s licensing currently. I can typically get you a discount on all licensing, except for teams voice licensing (I\u2019m sure that will change soon and I\u2019ll let you know when it does). For business premium licensing it\u2019s $264 annually if you buy it from Microsoft and I resell it for $252/annually. On pretty much any annual license I can offer 5% discount. If you go through the attached list and maybe highlight in red those people who do not need a license I can go through the process of removing licenses and make sure the LCW credit card on file with Microsoft no longer gets charged unnecessarily. Also, I talked with the team and moving from lcwmail.com to lcwinclusion.com or whatever domain you choose would involve a full email migration. It would be something we\u2019d do over a weekend and would have minimal impact on the users. We can definitely assist you with that and typical guidance is to budget an hour per mailbox.\n\u00a0\nAlso I can see that the box was delivered to Jake via Fedex, tracking number 781059794350 but it doesn\u2019t look like he\u2019s sent it back, tracking number 791373600964\n\u00a0\nThanks! \n\u00a0\nElijah J.

I\u2019ve also updated all OS to Win 11 for these machines and for some reason Kenya was not enrolled in intune which I have fixed. \n\u00a0\nUnfortunately we do not have a way to see what type of device Melissa has. As a bit of context we do not have our monitoring software installed on any of your devices, we only provide time and materials support when requested. If Melissa can go to System -> About and send a screenshot of what it say regarding the device I can help come up with a approximate value.

Build trust with Q&A sessions \ud83d\udc77\nSlido is democratic. You can easily see what\u2019s the most important issue or the top themes according to your people.\nSometimes people raise challenging questions or want to understand things more thoroughly. Learn \n5 ways how to deal with difficult employee questions\n during Q&As. \n \n2. Promote transparency \ud83d\udce3\nPeople have been able to see the positive results of speaking up and sharing their thoughts. It's built a trusting culture, which is really strong. \nRegular employee engagement surveys are a great way to learn how your team is doing and track progress. Create a \nsurvey in Slido\n and get inspired by Gallup's 12 \nemployee engagement survey questions\n. \n \n3. Lead people in a hybrid world \ud83e\uddd7\nInteraction is what takes your employee relationships to the next level. \nWith teams spread across the globe and busy schedules, it's never been more important to focus on connection. Simple check-in can help \nread the room\n and foster relationships.\n \n \nEqual experience for all participants in Teams\nNo more switching tabs or voting via phone for participants without a Microsoft account. Everyone can now vote comfortably directly in Teams and see Slido when shared on stage. \nOther than Teams improvements, we've got a new Slido launch screen in Webex. Check out all the details in \nJuly's Product News edition\n. \ud83c\udf89 \nAdd Slido to Teams \nDo you have a story on how Slido has helped your organization or meetings? \nWe\u2019d love to hear from you\n.\ud83d\udc9a \nP.S. Did you find the content helpful?\nIf you have any feedback, we'd love to hear your thoughts!\nVery helpful \nIt's OK\nNot helpful \nMade with \n by Slido\nFacebook\n | \nTwitter\n | \nLinkedIn\n | \nInstagram\n | \nYouTube\n \nHelp Centre & Community \n| \nContact us\n | \nPrivacy Statement\n | \nUnsubscribe\n \nsli.do s. r. o., Vajnorsk\u00e1 100/A, 831 04 Bratislava, Slovakia (European Union) \n\u00a9 2023 Cisco Systems, Inc.

    "subject": "What's New at Zoom | July 2023 Recap",
    "body": "Dear Kendall,\u00a0\nWhether it's new products and features or courses that teach you to use Zoom better, we are constantly evolving to improve your experience. To help keep you up to date, we have summarized some key new things you should know below. \nDownload\n the latest version of the Zoom desktop client to access all these features and more.\u00a0\nFor more resources to help you stay up to date, check out:\u00a0\nPreview notes\n \u2013 A list of upcoming features. This page is only available to Zoom account owners and admins; you must sign in to view them.\nRelease notes\n \u2013 A complete list of past releases across the Zoom platform.\u00a0\nIf you have questions about the features and announcements outlined below, please reply directly to this email.\n*Note: Some products and features may not be available to all customers.\u00a0\nZoom Learning Center Updates \nDiscover updated Zoom Rooms courses - \nThe Zoom Learning Center team recently updated the \nZoom Rooms catalog\n\u00a0to include information on all the latest and greatest features and enhancements. Refresh your memory on Zoom Rooms features, or learn something new like how you can reserve a Zoom Room with Workspace Reservation! \nZoom Community\u00a0 \nThe \nCustomer Success Forum\n\u00a0on the Zoom Community is now live!\n Launched in 2021, the \nZoom Community\n\u00a0is a hub for users to find answers, seek support, and receive guidance from fellow Zoom users and Zoom product experts. In the new Customer Success Forum, users will find a collaborative place to share success stories, learn about upcoming events, and exchange helpful ways to use Zoom features, all in one centralized, easily accessible location. Join the forum and learn more today!\nKey Highlights from Zoom\u2019s July Releases\u00a0 \nZoom Web\n\u00a0Updates \nSet default Team Chat channels for users\n\u00a0-\n Account owners and admins can set up to 5 default Team Chat channels, to which all new and existing users will automatically be added. The chosen channels must be public channels and users can choose to leave these default channels. \nZoom Phone\n\u00a0Updates \nAdvanced encryption for voicemails -\n Once advanced encryption for Zoom Phone voicemail is enabled, voicemail messages are received and recorded by Zoom servers which encrypt them with keys only known to their intended recipients\u2019 devices. If admins enable the Escrow feature within advanced encryption for voicemails, admins will now be able to access these keys and users voicemails. Shared Line Appearance, Shared Line Group, Call Queue, or Auto Receptionist voicemail are not supported. Additionally, functionalities like email to voicemail, transcriptions, and the ability to check voicemails through dialing or the web are disabled when this feature is enabled. To utilize this feature, users must have a Power Pack license. Only admins with appropriate permissions can manage these voicemails.\nZoom Events\n\u00a0Updates \nAttendee Companion app for Zoom - \nAttendees can join hybrid events using the companion app. This app allows them to attend an event in person or virtually without leaving Zoom Events. They can find, bookmark, and attend sessions in hybrid events. Attendees can navigate the physical space using maps and digital guides and switch between in-person and virtual webinar/meeting streams. During hybrid events, attendees can connect with in-person and virtual attendees. The companion app is available for iOS and Android devices. This feature may not be immediately available, as it is dependent on a backend server update. \nSecurity questions authentication for registration\n\u00a0-\n Hosts can enable security questions for registrants when creating an event. Security questions apply to all registrants regardless of how they join (i.e., sign in to Zoom/IDP or fast join). The host can choose questions from a list of security questions (a template of 10 questions) and can customize up to 3 security questions. The questions will appear on the registration page as a mandatory item. Registrants must pick at least one question from the list and answer it to complete registration. The answer to each question will be associated with unique users, and the answer will be stored safely on the Zoom Events platform. After authentication at joining, registrants must answer the question they chose at registration. Only the registrant has the answer to the security question. If the registrant loses the answer, they will also lose access to the assigned ticket and cannot join the event. Registrants can contact the host for help and can register another ticket from the event detail page.\nZoom IQ for Sales\n\u00a0Updates \nEmail compose with Zoom IQ for Sales\n\u00a0-\n Account owners and admins can enable or disable users' option to use Zoom IQ to create follow-up emails directly from the Zoom IQ for Sales Deals page. This setting is available at the account level and is disabled by default. This feature is currently not available for users with External IQ Admin and Zoom IQ Collaborator roles. \nZoom Contact Center\n\u00a0Updates \nSupport for regions -\n Account owners and admins can create regions to organize users based on their location and apply voice routing settings specific to each location. This feature must be enabled by Zoom. \nAuto answer with queue default greeting - \nAccount owners and admins can improve the call handling efficiency by implementing the auto answer feature for voice engagements. With auto answer, agents can automatically connect with callers, reducing the number of clicks required and providing a standardized caller experience. It also eliminates the need for agents to repeat the same greeting on every engagement, ensuring consistent greetings. \nVideo channel for integrations -\n The Zendesk and Salesforce integrations for Zoom Contact Center support the video channel. As a result, agents can receive incoming video engagements, make outbound video calls, upgrade a voice call to video call, and chat with the consumer using in-video chat during the video engagement within the integration. During an incoming/outbound video engagement, the agent can see the customer screen pop within the CRM based on the 'email address' match. Configuration settings have been updated with video channel settings for Screen pop and search settings.\u00a0 \nWorkspace Reservation\n\u00a0Updates \nWorkspaces admin management of reservations - \nAdmins can add, change, or delete reservations at the building level. They can also override users' reservations in the building. Admins can book a workspace for a user (without needing to set up delegation), change a current workspace reservation of a user, and delete a user's current reservation. The user will receive a\u00a0 notification if a change was made to the reservation by an admin. \nConfigure a permanent desk -\n Account owners and admins can assign a user a permanent desk. Permanent desks are not reservable and will always display the assigned user at that desk. This feature displays users, who come into the office every day, and their permanent desks on the floor map. \nBusiness Announcements \nZoom Software Lifecycle Policy -\n We plan to enforce the fourth round of our Software Lifecycle Policy on August 5, 2023, for all products and services, starting with the minimum versions referenced in the table found \nhere\n. Users running an end-of-life version after August 5 will not be able to join meetings via the Zoom Client and will be prompted to update or join from the Web browser. As always, we highly recommend you regularly download and update to the latest version of Zoom software by checking for updates within the Zoom desktop client or by navigating to \nzoom.us/download\n to take advantage of all our latest security and functionality features. Note: The end-of-life enforcement for Zoom Room Controllers on Windows UWP has been extended to August 5, 2023.\u00a0 \nEnd of Life for JSON Web Token (JWT) App Type in Zoom Marketplace -\n As a reminder, Zoom disabled the ability to create new JWT apps on June 1, 2023. Developers have until September 1, 2023 to migrate their JWT-based solutions to the new Server-to-Server OAuth or OAuth app types. For more information, please see the \nJWT migration guide\n\u00a0and \nJWT deprecation FAQ\n. \nHappy Zooming,\nZoom Success Advisor\nClick \nhere\n to unsubscribe from this list or manage your preferences \nhere\n.",

If you have already created an invoice for quote lines in June and July, then the report will consider those as well. Currently, the invoice report is only looking at the invoice \"Issued date\" and the total sum of the invoice.\u00a0\nHowever, you can use additional filters in the report, such as the \"Accounting status\", or you can look at the invoice due date instead of the issued date.\u00a0\n\u00a0\nFor example, if you select \"Issued date: All dates\" and \"Due date: Previous month\", you can see what your revenue for April should be.\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\nIt is definitely fair to say that Quotes show us planned future revenue while Invoices show us the actual revenue.\n\u00a0\nThis invoice \nhttps://lcw.scoro.com/invoices/view/844\n shows up in the report because currently, the report shows invoices with all accounting statuses. You would need to filter out invoices with the accounting status you wish to see. You can do that here:\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\nIt's very hard to say what the most accurate report for forecasting revenue would be for your business, as I don't know the details of your process and when you actually invoice the quotes. One way to look at it would be that all quotes with a successful status (I don't know your system for statuses) should be considered as future revenue. So, you can use the \"Quotes periodized\" report and filter out quotes with a successful status to predict revenue.\n\u00a0\nPlease let me know if you have any questions, and I'd be happy to assist!\n\u00a0\nKindest regards,\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 Anna-Justina K | Customer Support Specialist\nScoro | \nwww.scoro.com\n\u00a0 | Help videos and manuals: support.scoro.com\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\nThe Support team is still available for you from Mon to Fri, 5 am to 7 pm UTC.\nFind out more: \nscoro.com/4-day-work-week\nConfidentiality notice: The contents of this email message and any attachments are intended solely for the addressee(s) and may contain confidential and/or privileged information and may be legally protected from disclosure.\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\nOn 9 May 2023 at 13:46:26 UTC, Chuck Adams \nc.adams@lcwmail.com\n wrote:\nAnna-Justina \u2013 Thank you for your prompt response.\n\u00a0\nThe Quote line/Invoice explanation makes sense and I think it confirms what I thought. \n\u00a0\nA quote with lines of delivery dates of Apr, May, Jun and Jul will only count Apr and May (if already invoiced) in the invoice report currently.

The Quote report will show all quotes with quote lines in the time period you selected (this quarter) and the statuses you selected. The Invoice report will show all invoices created in the time period you selected. So my question would be that do you invoice all quotes within the same month they were created? If not, then you can't really compare the two reports.\u00a0\n\u00a0\nFor accurate reports, it's important to understand which dates to look at. If we take a closer look at the invoices created in April, for example, for Aflac Worldwide Headquarters and \nInvoice no. 17240335\n, we can see that the last line on the invoice is dated 01/30/2023. This means that even though the invoice was issued in April, it includes quote lines from January. Therefore, if we are comparing quote lines from April (as in your Quote report) and invoices issued in April, the sums can't and shouldn't match.\n\u00a0\nThe information is correct in both reports. You can use the \"Quotes periodized\" report to predict your income in specific time periods, but the actual income will depend on when the invoices are issued and when you actually receive payment. So the accuracy of the forecast will depend on when you invoice your quotes.\n\u00a0\nI hope this makes sense, but please let me know if you have any questions or need further information.\n\u00a0\nKindest regards,\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 Anna-Justina K | Customer Support Specialist\nScoro | \nwww.scoro.com\n\u00a0 | Help videos and manuals: support.scoro.com\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\nThe Support team is still available for you from Mon to Fri, 5 am to 7 pm UTC.\nFind out more: \nscoro.com/4-day-work-week\nConfidentiality notice: The contents of this email message and any attachments are intended solely for the addressee(s) and may contain confidential and/or privileged information and may be legally protected from disclosure.\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\nOn 8 May 2023 at 22:22:00 UTC, Chuck Adams \nc.adams@lcwmail.com\n wrote:\nHello \u2013 \n\u00a0\nWe are trying to find the most accurate quarterly/yearly projections in the various Scoro reports and we are seeing some inconsistencies in two that we intitially thought would be good for that.\n\u00a0\nThe quote report below (screenshot shows how filters are set) seems to show 10 quotes for April valued at $276,376.92 while the Invoice report, further down, shows 20 Invoices values at $592,147.15.

If you have already created an invoice for quote lines in June and July, then the report will consider those as well. Currently, the invoice report is only looking at the invoice \"Issued date\" and the total sum of the invoice.\u00a0\nHowever, you can use additional filters in the report, such as the \"Accounting status\", or you can look at the invoice due date instead of the issued date.\u00a0\n\u00a0\nFor example, if you select \"Issued date: All dates\" and \"Due date: Previous month\", you can see what your revenue for April should be.\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\nIt is definitely fair to say that Quotes show us planned future revenue while Invoices show us the actual revenue.\n\u00a0\nThis invoice \nhttps://lcw.scoro.com/invoices/view/844\n shows up in the report because currently, the report shows invoices with all accounting statuses. You would need to filter out invoices with the accounting status you wish to see. You can do that here:\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\nIt's very hard to say what the most accurate report for forecasting revenue would be for your business, as I don't know the details of your process and when you actually invoice the quotes. One way to look at it would be that all quotes with a successful status (I don't know your system for statuses) should be considered as future revenue. So, you can use the \"Quotes periodized\" report and filter out quotes with a successful status to predict revenue.\n\u00a0\nPlease let me know if you have any questions, and I'd be happy to assist!\n\u00a0\nKindest regards,\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 Anna-Justina K | Customer Support Specialist\nScoro | \nwww.scoro.com\n\u00a0 | Help videos and manuals: support.scoro.com\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\nThe Support team is still available for you from Mon to Fri, 5 am to 7 pm UTC.\nFind out more: \nscoro.com/4-day-work-week\nConfidentiality notice: The contents of this email message and any attachments are intended solely for the addressee(s) and may contain confidential and/or privileged information and may be legally protected from disclosure.\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\nOn 9 May 2023 at 13:46:26 UTC, Chuck Adams \nc.adams@lcwmail.com\n wrote:\nAnna-Justina \u2013 Thank you for your prompt response.\n\u00a0\nThe Quote line/Invoice explanation makes sense and I think it confirms what I thought. \n\u00a0\nA quote with lines of delivery dates of Apr, May, Jun and Jul will only count Apr and May (if already invoiced) in the invoice report currently.

The Quote report will show all quotes with quote lines in the time period you selected (this quarter) and the statuses you selected. The Invoice report will show all invoices created in the time period you selected. So my question would be that do you invoice all quotes within the same month they were created? If not, then you can't really compare the two reports.\u00a0\n\u00a0\nFor accurate reports, it's important to understand which dates to look at. If we take a closer look at the invoices created in April, for example, for Aflac Worldwide Headquarters and \nInvoice no. 17240335\n, we can see that the last line on the invoice is dated 01/30/2023. This means that even though the invoice was issued in April, it includes quote lines from January. Therefore, if we are comparing quote lines from April (as in your Quote report) and invoices issued in April, the sums can't and shouldn't match.\n\u00a0\nThe information is correct in both reports. You can use the \"Quotes periodized\" report to predict your income in specific time periods, but the actual income will depend on when the invoices are issued and when you actually receive payment. So the accuracy of the forecast will depend on when you invoice your quotes.\n\u00a0\nI hope this makes sense, but please let me know if you have any questions or need further information.\n\u00a0\nKindest regards,\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 Anna-Justina K | Customer Support Specialist\nScoro | \nwww.scoro.com\n\u00a0 | Help videos and manuals: support.scoro.com\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\nThe Support team is still available for you from Mon to Fri, 5 am to 7 pm UTC.\nFind out more: \nscoro.com/4-day-work-week\nConfidentiality notice: The contents of this email message and any attachments are intended solely for the addressee(s) and may contain confidential and/or privileged information and may be legally protected from disclosure.\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\nOn 8 May 2023 at 22:22:00 UTC, Chuck Adams \nc.adams@lcwmail.com\n wrote:\nHello \u2013 \n\u00a0\nWe are trying to find the most accurate quarterly/yearly projections in the various Scoro reports and we are seeing some inconsistencies in two that we intitially thought would be good for that.\n\u00a0\nThe quote report below (screenshot shows how filters are set) seems to show 10 quotes for April valued at $276,376.92 while the Invoice report, further down, shows 20 Invoices values at $592,147.15.

There are a few dozen marked \u201cclient\u201d (most of your names in blue) and others marked \u201cfacilitator\u201d or \u201ccontractor.\u201d\n\u00a0\nFor the names marked CLIENT (below) I believe we had licenses related to our ability to interface via Teams, perhaps? Although by that logic BSC should be listed, and they are not.\n\u00a0\nCLIENTS\nWe need to ask the client relationship manager of each of these organizations if these licenses are needed: \nJ&J, Northwestern, Ubisoft, The Learning Gym, Steel Global\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\nFACILITATORS\nFor facilitators I believe we had ms accounts so they can interact with our clients with a united LCW front (using our email). We should make an executive decision about whether we want this to continue. I think it is very valuable to do so.\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\nI have still managed to tag 35 accounts as NOT NEEDED (some of these are duplicates of the lists above)\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\nLet me know if I can support any further, happy to coordinate the communications with the client relationship managers (a few of whom are on this email lol).\n\u00a0\nThanks,\nSarah\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\nFrom:\n Chuck Adams <\nc.adams@lcwmail.com\n> \nSent:\n Wednesday, June 14, 2023 4:42 PM\nTo:\n Daniel Gough <\nd.gough@lcwmail.com\n>; Sarah Nodarse <\ns.nodarse@lcwmail.com\n>; Tamara Thorpe <\nt.thorpe@lcwmail.com\n>\nCc:\n Alisa Kolodizner <\na.kolodizner@lcwmail.com\n>; Kendall Washington <\nk.washington@lcwmail.com\n>\nSubject:\n RE: MS License Inventory - For Review\n\u00a0\nThank you, Dan.\nFind new attached.\n\u00a0\n______________________________________\nChuck Adams \nCo-CEO and Managing Principal\n\u00a0\nLCW\n4753 N Broadway, Floor 2\nChicago, IL 60640\nOffice: \n+1.773.938.4285\nMobile: +1.630.373.5068\n\u00a0\nwww\n\u00a0:\u00a0\ntwitter\n\u00a0\n:\u00a0\nfacebook\n\u00a0\n:\u00a0\nlinkedin\n\u00a0\n \n\u00a0\nFrom:\n Daniel Gough <\nd.gough@lcwmail.com\n> \nSent:\n Wednesday, June 14, 2023 4:33 PM\nTo:\n Chuck Adams <\nc.adams@lcwmail.com\n>; Sarah Nodarse <\ns.nodarse@lcwmail.com\n>; Tamara Thorpe <\nt.thorpe@lcwmail.com\n>\nCc:\n Alisa Kolodizner <\na.kolodizner@lcwmail.com\n>; Kendall Washington <\nk.washington@lcwmail.com\n>\nSubject:\n RE: MS License Inventory - For Review\n\u00a0\nHi Chuck,\nThe document came in without formatting.
