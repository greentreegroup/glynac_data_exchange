See \nTerms of Service\n for more details. \n2 5 Days Early to Your Bank Account: Personal taxes only. Your federal tax refund will be deposited to your selected bank account 5 days before the refund settlement date provided by the IRS (the date your refund would have arrived if sent from the IRS directly). The receipt of your refund 5 Days Early is subject to IRS submitting refund information to us at least 5 days before the refund settlement date. IRS does not always provide refund settlement information 5 days early. You will not be eligible to receive your refund 5 Days Early if (1) you take a Refund Advance loan, (2) IRS delays payment of your refund, or (3) your bank\u2019s policies do not allow for same-day payment processing. 5 Days Early fee will be deducted directly from your refund prior to being deposited to your bank account. If your refund cannot be delivered 5 Days Early, you will not be charged the 5 Days Early fee. 5 Days Early program may change or be discontinued at any time. \nClick here\n to see TurboTax product guarantees, disclaimers and other important information. \nThis email \nwas \nsent to: \nd.trincado@lcwmail.com\n \nDid you receive this email in error? \nFind out why\n. \nUpdate your email preferences or unsubscribe \nhere\n. \n\u00a92025 Intuit Inc.

The good news? Workers want help quitting. In fact, 66% of them would be very interested in using a tobacco cessation program through their dental insurance plan if it came at no additional cost. This is especially true for workers whose children may also use tobacco products, especially e-cigarettes. Organizations would benefit, too, by retaining a healthier, more productive workforce and lower medical claims costs.\n\u00a0\nA few of the findings:\u00a0\n60% of smokeless tobacco users say that if they knew the products harmed their oral health, they would consider quitting.\n\u00a0\n82% of workers with a child who uses tobacco would be interested in a tobacco cessation program if the program were available to dependents.\n\u00a0\nCigarette smokers take an average of over 7 more days of sick leave per year compared to non-smokers.\nExpanding benefits programs to include support for tobacco cessation can be important for oral, physical, and mental health. \nDownload the report\n \nto discover how to find the right solutions.\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\nExplore Guardian Edge\n\u00a0\nGet the latest workplace benefits insights with a variety of content \u2014 including articles, checklists, reports, and more \u2014 to help support all stages of your employees' journeys.\u202f\nVisit Guardian Edge\n.\n\u200a\nUnless otherwise noted, all data is sourced from Guardian\u2019s 13th Annual Workplace Benefits Study, 2024.\n\u00a0\nFor broker/agent use only.\n\u00a0\nMaterial discussed is meant for general informational purposes only and is not to be construed as tax, legal, medical or financial advice.

But many employees may not make this connection, and fail to protect their income the way they protect other things that are innately important to them \u2014 health, home, and family.\nBy shedding light on some of the misconceptions around disability insurance, workers are able to help better protect themselves and employers are able to help better protect their workforces.

In fact, \n25% of today\u2019s 20-year-olds\n will take a disability-related leave before reaching retirement age.\n2\n And 30% of US households have had a main wage earner experience at least one injury, illness, or condition that resulted in either a short-term disability (STD) or long-term disability (LTD) leave sometime in the past 10 years.\n3\nLeading causes of disability claims:\nDisability insurance covers a lot more than your employees might realize.

On average, 38% of employers pay the full cost of their disability benefit plans, 47% share the cost with workers, and 17% offer employee-pay-all or voluntary disability coverage.\n5\nOther support for employees facing a possible disability leave\nTaking a disability leave may be stressful for employees.

Indeed, they can, and in fact, some states require it. These income protection provisions serve as vital safety nets \u2013 safeguarding employees\u2019 physical, mental, and financial health.

My guess is that the payee\u2019s bank also had to convert the USD in Euros and used what ever the rate was at the time.

Maybe her email changed??\n\u00a0\nAlso \n@Tamara\n \u2013 I\u2019ve updated the process doc for using ext consultants & have added 2 email templates to the doc.

It is nice to e-meet you. As a native Russian speaker with near-native English fluency of a US citizen, I have a university degree in interpreting and 20+ of simultaneous and consecutive interpreting experience.\u00a0\n\u00a0\nTo your inquiry, I do indeed have extensive GMP inspection interpreting experience, having serviced\n\u00a0\n35 GMP inspections\n\u00a0\nas a Russian interpreter over the last\n\u00a0\n6 years\n\u2014including 11 GMP inspections last year alone\u2014which I serviced either onsite \u00a0virtually from my remote office. Thus, I am very familiar and comfortable with the inspection format, procedures and specific terminology. \u00a0The client should be rest assured, as I have serviced GMP inspections at AstraZeneca, Merck, Pfizer, Patheon, Ely Lilly, Sanofi, BMS, Genentech, AbbVie, Baxter etc.\u00a0\n\u00a0\nIt will be a pleasure to assist Catalent KY with the upcoming inspection.\u00a0\n\u00a0\nI understand the interpreting service is needed virtually. My half-day fee is \u00a0$350 (up to 4 hours), so the total based on the below description will be $1,750. If any of the days \u00a0end up being longer than 4 hours (happens sometimes, but rarely), the cost will be $87.50 for each additional hour past the 4 hours.\u00a0\n\u00a0\nSince some sites prefer that I travel onsite for a virtual inspection, I also would like to put it out there that I am also available to travel to (and render services from) Catalent KY if Catalent colleagues would prefer. If so, the interpretation time would change to full-day fees and I\u2019d be glad to advise re: the additional travel expenses.\u00a0\n\u00a0\nI trust this is helpful. I will pencil the dates in my calendar. As my work schedule changes daily, your prompt confirmation (once the PO is confirmed), is appreciated. Please feel free to reach out with any updates or questions. Thank you in advance.\u00a0\n\u00a0\nKind regards,\u00a0\nTatyana Bessonov, MA, CCI\nENG<->RUS Conference Interpreter\u00a0\nUN * Conferences * RSI * GMP Pharma\u00a0* Law\nIAPTI, ATA, NAJIT\ntel: 847-924-7476 \u00a0* fax: 815-364-1478 *\u00a0\u00a0\nemail: tbessonov@gmail.com\nweb:\u00a0\nhttp://atanet.org/onlinedirectories/tsd_listings/tsd_view.fpl?id=14143\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\nOn Jan 13, 2023, at 9:40 AM, Maya Benoit <\nM.Benoit@lcwmail.com\n> wrote:\n\u00a0\nHello Tatyana,\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\nI\u2019m Maya and I\u2019m part of the localization team at LCW.\nWe found your details on the ATA website, as we are looking for a Russian interpreter with GMP inspection experience and your profile seems to match.\n\u00a0\nA Pharma client of ours needs an interpreter for a virtual GMP inspection.

I just want to let you know it had nothing to do with you at all, as you have always supported me. Me and Alisa talked about a few things this morning and I believe I set the bar too high for myself. I have been really behind the last two weeks because of Payroll, etc. And I should have communicated my frustrations better to the team. Overall, I was extremely overwhelmed, and I made a bad decision. There is a lot more to talk about, but I just want to thank you for your support. \n\u00a0\n\u00a0\nDavid Trincado\nStaff Accountant, \nLCW\nEmail: \nd.trincado@lcwmail.com\nPhone: +1 773-938-3958\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\nwww\n\u00a0\n|\n\u00a0\nTwitter\n\u00a0\n|\n\u00a0\nFacebook\n\u00a0\n|\n\u00a0\nLinkedIn\n\u00a0-\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\nFrom:\n Nicole Barile <n.barile@lcwmail.com> \nSent:\n Tuesday, January 17, 2023 1:28 PM\nTo:\n David Trincado <d.trincado@lcwmail.com>\nSubject:\n Checking in\n\u00a0\nHey David,\n\u00a0\nI heard the news.

I also saw 50K was transferred into the Village bank checking account but it was not added to the PPF--I went ahead and updated that. Regardless, everything else looked good and matches.\n\u00a0\nI have added \nMaya Benoit\u2019s payment\n to the PPF form. We gave her Net 15 terms so the payments should have been sent out Friday.

I had no idea that the remit as designed was causing you the stress you referenced in your note to Alisa.\nWith the suddeness of your exit I can't help but wonder if there is additional information that you'd be willing to share with me. I would hate to hire someone else only to find the same conditions exist to drive them away as well.\nPlease let me know if you are free to chat today. Any feedback would be helpful to me as a leader of the organization. This is a critical role and I need to make sure that it is designed and supported well in order to serve the employees here.\nFeel free to call me or text me at the mobile number below if you'd rather chat.\nHope to hear from you soon.\nChuck\n______________________________________\nChuck Adams\n\u00a0\nCo-CEO and Managing Principal\n\u00a0\nLCW\n100 South Saunders Rd, Suite 150\nLake Forest, IL 60045 USA\nOffice:\n\u00a0\n+1.773.938.4285\nMobile:\n\u00a0\n+1.630.373.5068\n\u00a0\nwww\n\u00a0:\u00a0\ntwitter\n\u00a0\n:\u00a0\nfacebook\n\u00a0\n:\u00a0\nlinkedin",

However, It has been nothing short of overwhelming in terms of my position. I need to be honest with myself-I believe this position requires more relevant experience and time to live up to its required expectations. This is a bitter pill to swallow, but I need to be honest with you and say I cannot provide the relevant experience you expect for this position. I have tried my best to learn all the responsibilities, taking it as a challenge, but I believe there is a better fit out there. \n\u00a0\nPlease let me know what address I can send the laptop equipment back and my CC as I would like to do this asap. I was planning on resigning on Tuesday, but I do not feel that is the right choice as there is a holiday weekend coming up, so please consider yesterday as my last day.\n\u00a0\nThe things that need immediate attention is sending out \nW9s (by Jan 27\nth\n) and Bill.com Payments\n. \n\u00a0\nGoing forward, please reach out to me via my personal email if you need anything: \nTrincado11@gmail.com\n \n\u00a0\nDavid Trincado\nStaff Accountant, \nLCW\nEmail: \nd.trincado@lcwmail.com\nPhone: +1 773-938-3958\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\nwww\n\u00a0\n|\n\u00a0\nTwitter\n\u00a0\n|\n\u00a0\nFacebook\n\u00a0\n|\n\u00a0\nLinkedIn\n\u00a0-",

This is an assessment that we offer to clients, and new hires at LCW are invited to take it as well. I have attached the pre-read document so that you can read a little bit more about it. If you would like to take it, I will order you a login code. It takes about 20-30 minutes to complete. Then, we will schedule a 1-hour debrief to go over your results. I'll be delivering the debrief, and Jeffrey will be observing me. There is no hurry to take it. My goal is to complete the new hire debriefs by the end of February.\u00a0\nThank you,\nKaitlin Nonweiler\u00a0\n(she/her/hers)\nIDI Administrator & Coach\u00a0\nEmail: \nk.nonweiler@lcwmail.com\n\u00a0\nPhone: 773-828-6808 (CST)\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0 \u00a0\n\u00a0\nwww\n\u00a0\n|\n\u00a0\nTwitter\n \n|\n\u00a0\nFacebook\n\u00a0\n|\n\u00a0\nLinkedIn\n\u00a0\u00a0\nTo inspire kindness, deepen\u00a0understanding, and foster equity in\u00a0the communities\u00a0where people live\u00a0and at the organizations where they\u00a0work.",

As always, our customers\u2019 safety is top of mind. Here are some important practical steps you can take to help protect your property during extreme cold\u00a0weather. \n\u00a0 \n \n\u00a0 \nPipe Bursts \n\u00a0 \n\u00a0 \nEnsuring adequate heat and monitoring facilities are important steps. Our research indicates frozen pipes cause some of the most common and costliest cold weather claims (>$18K, on average). Not surprisingly, the risk of pipe bursts can increase when businesses are closed or unoccupied (e.g., due to storm closings). From schools whose students are out on break (and leave windows open) to businesses that close for a weekend, we\u2019ve seen some very disruptive losses when pipes freeze and water flows \u2013 sometimes for days before being\u00a0noticed. \n\u00a0 \n \n\u00a0 \nSlip & Falls \n\u00a0 \n\u00a0 \nSlip and fall accidents can be very impactful to your business, whether they involve your employees or someone else legally on your premises. Each year these accidents result in thousands of workers\u2019 compensation or third party liability claims. In fact, slip and falls account for approximately 1/3 of our workers\u2019 compensation and general liability\u00a0claims. \n\u00a0 \nThis risk can increase substantially with winter weather. What can you do to protect your employees and customers and avoid these claims? Some important steps\u00a0are: \n\u00a0 \n\u00a0 \n\u2022 \nTreat all exterior areas where you expect to have pedestrian and/or vehicle traffic. Once and done is not sufficient \u2014 inspect and treat areas of potential hazard\u00a0frequently. \n\u00a0 \n\u2022 \nMake certain the property has ample lighting during the shorter daylight hours of\u00a0winter. \n\u00a0 \n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\nWe\u2019re here to help.\n For more on how you can protect your property, see our \nonline article\n.
