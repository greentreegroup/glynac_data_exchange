    "body": "Plus: the importance of aligned incentives. \nThe upside of in-person work \u00a0\u00b7\u00a0 \nView in browser\n \nThe Insightful Leader\nBY \nKELLOGG INSIGHT\nLeadership advice from the Kellogg School of Management at Northwestern University\nGood morning,\nIt\u2019s been about four years since COVID-19 began spreading across the world\u2014and with it, the popularity of remote work.\nHere in the U.S., most remote-capable jobs (60 percent) used to be done exclusively on-site. But in a \nfew short years\n, those numbers have been flipped on their head. Now that number is just 20 percent. In other words, the majority of workers who can telework now do, at least part time.\nSo at \nKellogg Insight\n, we\u2019re always on the lookout for studies that can tell us how to make sense of remote work. Today, we\u2019ll share one such study. Plus: compensating Elon Musk, and why we\u2019re all suddenly afraid to fly on planes.\nProximity isn\u2019t dead yet\nIn-person work has an important role to play in innovation and, in particular, in how much we are able to \nlearn\n from our collaborators.\n \nThis finding comes from a study by Kellogg\u2019s \nHyejin Youn\n and her collaborator Frank van der Wouden of the University of Hong Kong (and a former Kellogg postdoc). The researchers analyzed more than 17 million scientific publications over the past 45 years.\nSpecifically, they set out to identify scholars who had gained new knowledge from their previous collaborations. A good proxy for this, they realized, was doing research in a new field: someone who started their career in one academic discipline, then collaborated with authors from another discipline, and ultimately published a paper in that new field as a sole author. This seemed like straightforward evidence that they\u2019d learned from their earlier collaboration. In their sample, the team found 1.7 million researchers who fit the bill.\nThen they identified the geographic locations of those researchers and their collaborators. Collaborators were considered \u201clocal\u201d if they were less than 700 meters apart, about a 10-minute walk.\nThey found that researchers who collaborated locally were more likely to gain new knowledge from their teammates than those who collaborated at a distance. The difference was most pronounced in the science and engineering disciplines, as well as for researchers who were in the earlier stages of their careers, and those at lower-ranked institutions.\nThe researchers take this as evidence that being together physically\u2014perhaps reading body language, mulling a problem at a whiteboard, and teaming up to use specialized laboratory equipment\u2014is particularly important for innovation.\nWhich doesn\u2019t mean working remotely doesn\u2019t have its place. Youn is a big fan of hybrid work, where employees can be productive at home, but then work together in-person to generate something new.\n\u201cWe learn from each other in person more than we think we do,\u201d Youn says. \u201cThat\u2019s part of our success as humans, especially when it comes to knowledge that is new, not yet defined. You have to be present to watch and learn. And collaborating locally is the way to do that.\u201d\nYou can read more about the research in \nKellogg Insight\n \nhere\n.\nThe importance of aligning incentives\nElon Musk isn\u2019t the only one who was disappointed when a Delaware judge decided to deny him his $55 billion dollar compensation package. \nGeorge Georgiadis\n, an associate professor of strategy at Kellogg, wasn\u2019t pleased either.\nYes, $55 billion is a pretty eye-popping sum, he acknowledges in a recent piece for \nThe Hill\n. But the package was specifically designed to be high-risk, high-reward to incentivize performance\u2014and somewhat improbably, Tesla\u2019s stock price hit nearly all of its targets.\nMy argument doesn\u2019t center on whether Musk, already a multibillionaire, would be more or less incentivized with $10 billion instead of $50 billion. The concern lies in preserving and protecting the integrity and effectiveness of performance pay.\nPerformance pay can be highly effective in aligning a company\u2019s goals with employees\u2019 actions, even when the likelihood of hitting performance targets seems slim. It aids in retaining employees, particularly high performers. Bonuses, alongside stock and option awards subject to vesting, provide compelling reasons for talented individuals to remain with the company.

    "body": "You don't often get email from johns@drjohnsullivan.com. \nLearn why this is important\nThe recent Post-COVID hiring shortage wasn\u2019t temporary, instead, it\u2019s a permanent business condition.\n \n \nShare\n \n \nShare\n \n \nTweet\n \nLATEST ARTICLE\n \nThis \u201cForever\u201d Hiring Shortage\u2026 Will Forever Hurt Your Business Results (Shifting to Competitive Advantage Recruiting)\nThe recent Post-COVID hiring shortage wasn\u2019t temporary, instead, it\u2019s a permanent business condition. So why isn\u2019t it a standard corporate practice to measure (and respond to) the current level of recruiting competition in your industry?\nDescriptors\n| Recruiting / Hiring shortages \u2013 Future of recruiting components \u2013 5 min read\nIn order to minimize the business damage during this prolonged shortage, Recruiting will be required to make a quantum shift in both its recruiting strategy and its hiring tools. So, the recruiting function now offers its organization a competitive advantage over each of its major recruiting competitors. I call this required new TA strategy, Competitive Advantage Recruiting (or CAR).\nCompetitive Advantage Recruiting\u2026 provides the recruits that allow business units to prosper\nCompetitive Advantage Recruiting is a next-generation recruiting strategy designed to allow a corporation to dominate the hiring competition in its industry. Its primary differentiating factor is that it is externally focused. So, it has as its primary goal the reaching and then the maintaining of a competitive advantage in this permanently competitive marketplace. Of course, for that to happen, every aspect of your recruiting process must have a superior design. So that it produces superior results (when compared side-by-side to the same process in operation at your TA competitors). A second goal is to provide superior recruiting performance as a result of using an objective data-driven recruiting strategy and toolkit. A listing of the core elements of this CAR strategy can be found later in this article.\u00a0\nNote:\n\u00a0You can learn more about the steps for implementing Competitive Advantage Recruiting\u00a0\nhere\n.\u00a0\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\nExpect These Negative Business Consequences\u00a0\n(When you fail to adapt to this forever shortage)\u00a0\nKorn Ferry\n\u00a0estimates that by 2030, this global talent shortfall will result in 85 million open jobs that can\u2019t be filled. And that failure will cost companies trillions of dollars in lost economic opportunities. When that shortfall occurs at your corporation, your executives will realize that this hiring shortage will permanently hurt your sales/profit, stock price, production, AI, supply chain, and innovation. These top 10 negative consequences are listed below, with the highest impact negative consequences appearing early on the list.\u00a0\nExecutives will notice the revenue shortfalls \u2013\n\u00a0when recruiting ends up hiring lower-performing individuals into revenue-generating positions. Or when revenue-generating and revenue-impact positions are left vacant for too long. Your business will not generate enough revenue to meet its budget allocations. And that loss in revenue may actually lower your stock price.\nInnovation will come to a grinding halt \u2013\n\u00a0employees will be overworked because of numerous hiring failures in key positions. These innovator employees simply won\u2019t have the time to collaborate or to think about future innovations. In addition, in a highly competitive marketplace. A strained and poorly designed recruiting process won\u2019t have the capability to recruit additional innovators successfully. Taken together, these will limit your organization\u2019s most valuable human output.\nSome work simply won\u2019t get done\u00a0\n\u2013 when a significant percentage of your priority jobs go unfilled. Much important work simply won\u2019t get done. And when one phase of a business process doesn\u2019t get completed, the output of the entire process will be reduced.\nDeadlines will be missed\n\u00a0\u2013 with a significant percentage of your priority jobs going unfilled. And with other jobs remaining open for months. Many internal and external deadlines will simply be missed.\nWork quality will diminish\n\u00a0\u2013ineffective sourcing and candidate screening processes will result in the hiring of many weak performers. Those mis-hires, coupled with so many unfilled jobs, will require team members to work longer hours just to produce the same volume of work. And that employee strain/stress will likely result in more accidents. As well as a measurably lower quality of work that your customers will likely notice.\nYour new hire turnover will be high\n\u00a0\u2013 because your overworked recruiters won\u2019t likely have enough time to match a top candidate perfectly with their perfect job/manager. Your new hire turnover rate will likely be extremely high, and that will be extremely expensive.\nYou will hire less diversity \u2013\u00a0\ndiverse teams are desirable because studies show they are more productive. However, without a data-driven diversity recruiting process that provides a competitive advantage, you will likely fail to get even your fair share of the available diversity candidates.\nOutdated hiring processes will hurt your brand \u2013\n\u00a0when your image as a desirable company fades. As a result of potential candidates learning about ineffective hiring processes and a poor candidate experience. Over time, your recruiting results will continue to degrade unabated.\nHiring manager time will be wasted\n\u00a0\u2013 a weak, noncompetitive recruiting process will result in many failed searches. And having to reopen so many of them will exhaust and frustrate your hiring managers.\nTA may be outsourced\n\u00a0\u2013 as the hiring shortage at your organization becomes more severe over time. You can expect added pressure from your executives to give up and to outsource your entire function to a lower-cost vendor instead.\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\nHere Are The Core Elements\u2026 Of The CAR Strategy\nFor your corporation to remain successful during this permanent hiring shortfall, I have found that it must shift away from the traditional recruiting model. And shift into this competitive advantage recruiting strategy. A dozen core elements of this Competitive Advantage Recruiting strategy are highlighted below.\nRaise the bar to recruiting domination\u00a0\n\u2013 even the recruiting functions that have been successful in the past. Will struggle throughout this \u201cforever\u201d hiring shortage because of the intense competition that everyone will now face. This will force your executives to raise the bar on recruiting, away from the historical goal of simply being competitive, to a higher goal of recruiting dominance in your industry. And it will be quickly obvious to everyone that you won\u2019t be able to dominate without a much more aggressive strategy and toolkit. That includes a component of continually tracking every aspect of the recruiting marketplace and what each of your TA competitors is doing.\u00a0\nIt is data / metric driven\n\u00a0\u2013 with the high level of competition, you simply can\u2019t tolerate high error rates. So, this CAR strategy emphasizes data-driven decisions and the use of performance metrics throughout the recruiting process.\nIt emphasizes having direct business impacts\n\u00a0\u2013 because clear ownership leads to excellence. TA must accept the accountability for not just completing hires. But going further to ensure that those hires produce measurably higher business impacts. So, as part of the strategy, TA must have a process for measuring the direct business impact that recruiting creates in each strategic business function.\nIt prioritizes key jobs\n\u00a0\u2013 because there are never enough resources to hire the best for every open job. This CAR strategy prioritizes jobs so that it is easier to focus the most and the best recruiting resources on filling these priority jobs with exceptional talent. Similarly, the strategy also prioritizes key business units and teams.\nIt uses a mass personalized recruiting approach\u00a0\n\u2013 research shows that targeted, personalized recruiting is much more effective than the \u201ctreat them all the same\u201d shotgun approach. So, the CAR strategy focuses on providing \u201cmass personalized\u201d recruiting in priority jobs. The first step in mass personalization is accepting the fact that top candidates now hold (and will continue to hold) a lopsided amount of power in the recruiting relationship. Mass personalization also requires you to treat top candidates as unique individuals who will add tremendous value to your organization. This customized approach also requires you to tailor your recruitment marketing and your assessment and selling approaches. So that they closely fit the candidate\u2019s expectations, needs, and job acceptance criteria.\u00a0\nIt is an aggressive strategy \u2013\u00a0\nyou certainly won\u2019t be able to win a long-term \u201cwar for talent\u201d unless you are aggressive and are willing to take some risks. And that level of aggressiveness begins with directly targeting (some call it poaching) the most desirable \u201cpassive candidates\u201d currently fully employed because the very best and most desirable candidates are likely already working across the street at one of your competitors. As an added bonus, when you recruit employees away from individual competitors. You will likely also acquire their organization\u2019s new ideas and best practices.\nThe strategy assumes continuous obsolescence\n\u00a0\u2013 in order to keep up with the rapid speed of change that results from the continuous implementation of new recruiting technology. Recruiting leaders must assume that every element in your current recruiting effort is constantly becoming obsolete. To avoid obsolescence, TA must use data to continually test and then update every individual recruiting process and tool that is beginning to become obsolete.\u00a0\nIt demands that you only use the best sources\n\u00a0\u2013 because all successful hiring of top performers starts with great sourcing. TA leaders must use data to identify and exclusively use the best sources to find candidates for each priority job. Usually, the most effective sourcing channel that should be emphasized is a data-driven referral program that makes every employee a 24/7 talent scout.\nIt hires fast\n\u00a0\u2013 because the competition for top candidates will remain high. The best candidates may now make their job choices even faster. And that will mean that you won\u2019t be successful unless you assess candidates and make offers faster than your competitors. That means that you must analyze every hour of your hiring process. To shorten it without negatively impacting new hire quality.\nIt creates a candidate pipeline\n\u00a0\u2013 one of the keys to successfully hiring the top \u201cpassive candidates.\u201d It is to start identifying and building a relationship of trust with them long before you actually have an open position for them. And the tremendous value added by this \u201cupfront time.\u201d This makes the creation and maintenance of this pipeline essential.\nIt builds a powerful brand\n\u00a0\u2013 in a highly competitive marketplace. It\u2019s important to realize that top candidates are first drawn to employers with a well-known employer brand. So, if you even expect to get the attention of the most in-demand candidates. You must build, maintain, and measure the strength of your organization\u2019s employer brand.\nYour recruiters must be tech and business-savvy\u00a0\n\u2013 to successfully recruit top tech and in-demand talent. You must have sophisticated recruiters who fully understand each candidate and the technologies that they use. Also, to gain the trust and the time of your hiring managers. Your recruiters must fully understand the business environment and the challenges that the hiring manager faces.\nYou must emphasize recruiting remote workers\u00a0\n\u2013 because hiring shortages are often limited to a few geographic areas. Hiring managers can avoid some of those shortages by opening up more remote work opportunities. In addition, hiring managers must realize that they can only land some top global candidates if they offer them a work-at-home option.\u00a0\nNote:\n\u00a0You can learn more about the additional critical success factors in this CAR strategy\u00a0\nhere\n.\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\nIf You Want To Know More About\u2026 The Underlying Causes Of This Shortage\nIf you\u2019re interested, this next section provides a \u201csnapshot list\u201d of what I have found to be the top 10 factors. That is driving this increase in the recruiting competition. Either by increasing the number of job openings or talent competitors. Or by reducing the available supply of applicants.\u00a0\nFactors that are increasing the number of job openings\nThe expanding use of technology results in numerous new job openings\u00a0\n\u2013 the ever-accelerating spread of technology into every business function. This means that there will continue to be multiple job openings available to each qualified candidate. But especially in the functional areas of AI, Quantum Computing, IT, marketing, and data security.\nHigh employee turnover rates are increasing the number of job openings\u00a0\n\u2013 since the beginning of the great resignation, employee turnover rates have been high. With so many employee departures, companies will continue to have more jobs to refill.\u00a0\nWeak corporate recruiting will keep jobs open for longer\n\u00a0\u2013 budget cuts and recruiter layoffs will continue to limit the recruiting capabilities of many corporations. And with so many ineffective corporate recruiting efforts. Most hard-to-fill jobs will stay open much longer. And that will increase the number of days when a recruiter must compete against other active recruiters.\u00a0\nFactors that are decreasing the number of potential applicants\nRapid skill obsolescence reduces the number of highly skilled candidates\u00a0\n\u2013 in our fast-changing world, employee skills quickly become outdated. And that, coupled with massive cutbacks in corporate training, means that the percentage of the workforce currently upskilled in the needed technology areas isn\u2019t rising to meet the demand for skilled new hires. While at the same time, there may be a continuing surplus of lower-skilled workers.\nGig jobs reduce the available corporate workforce\n\u00a0\u2013 the increased availability of gig jobs and Internet income opportunities. It will continue to reduce the percentage of the overall workforce interested in corporate jobs.\nRetirements continue\u00a0\n\u2013 large-scale baby boom retirements are ongoing. And those retirements continue to reduce the size of the available workforce.\u00a0\nThere is a shortage of college grads\u00a0\n\u2013 fewer students are now entering college. And the number of graduates in hot technical majors hasn\u2019t kept up with the demand. So, college recruiting in hot majors will continue to be highly competitive.\nLower levels of immigration\n\u00a0\u2013 lower projected levels of legal immigration. A decrease in the number of foreign students attending US colleges will result in a lower supply of international workers who can work in US facilities.\nSmaller families reduce the growth of the workforce\u00a0\n\u2013 a global population shrinkage trend is now a problem in Italy, Japan, China, and, to some extent, the US. This continuing trend will mean fewer young candidates will enter the workforce over the next decade.\u00a0\nWorker priorities are changing\u00a0\n\u2013 because of the Covid scare and the continuing high unemployment rate. This has caused many potential candidates to take their time in deciding whether they will return to corporate work. In addition, increased levels of employee burnout and harsh return-to-the-office policies are also causing many potential applicants to delay their return to the workforce.\nIf you only do one thing\u00a0\n\u2013 begin to track these ratios. The number of qualified applicants per priority open jobs. And the number of companies actively recruiting for your most critical job to determine how stiff your recruiting competition currently is.\nFinal Thoughts\nHistorically, the critical factors essential for business growth included access to enough capital, land/raw materials, machinery, and labor/management capabilities. However, in today\u2019s fast-moving and quick-to-copy everything global business environment. A new business growth paradigm has been developing. So, over time,\n\u00a0technology capability, innovation, and speed may soon become the three top critical success factors\u00a0\nthat now drive continuous business growth.\u00a0\nAs a result of the emergence of these new growth factors, great hiring has become strategically essential. A corporation simply can\u2019t develop or implement technology, move fast, or innovate without the capability of successfully hiring exceptional candidates in the most competitive recruiting marketplace ever.\nAuthor\u2019s Note\n\u00a0\nPlease spread these ideas\n\u00a0by sharing this article with your team/network\n\u00a0and by posting it on your favorite media.\nAlso, join the well over 20,000+ that follow or have connected with Dr. Sullivan\u2019s community on\u00a0\nLinkedIn\n.\u00a0\nAnd, if you don\u2019t already subscribe to Dr. Sullivan\u2019s Aggressive Talent Management articles, you can do that\u00a0\nhere\n.\nMOST RECENT ARTICLES\nThis \u201cForever\u201d Hiring Shortage\u2026 Will Forever Hurt Your Business Results\u00a0(Shifting to Competitive Advantage Recruiting)\nDiscover Exceptional Candidates \u2013 Scan Resumes For These Talent Indicators\nCompetitive Retaliation \u2013 When They Recruit Your Talent\u2026 Strike Back Hard!

In this free webinar, economist \nNicola Persico\n offers up his home country, Italy, as a cautionary tale for the United States. He argues that demographic changes, debt, and overregulation have led to low growth\u2014and could do the same in America if the country doesn\u2019t make smart policy decisions going forward.\n\u00a0\nRegister\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\nFaculty Speaker\n\u00a0\nNicola Persico\n is the John L. and Helen Kellogg Professor of Managerial Economics & Decision Sciences at Kellogg.

    "body": "Plus: this year's best Super Bowl ads. \nLove at first cite \u00a0\u00b7\u00a0 \nView in browser\n \nThe Insightful Leader\nBY \nKELLOGG INSIGHT\nLeadership advice from the Kellogg School of Management at Northwestern University\nGood morning,\nHappy Valentine\u2019s Day! Here at \nKellogg Insight\n, we may not have candy or roses to offer you, but we do have the next best thing: academic studies about marriage. \nAnd if this particular holiday is not your thing, never fear! We\u2019ll also share some highlights from the \n20th annual Kellogg School Super Bowl Advertising Review\n.\nMatters of the heart\nWant to understand the science of marriage a bit better? For best results, please imagine these findings presented to you in a heart-shaped velvet box: \n1. \nPreparing to tie the knot? Consider a joint bank account. \nAmong the most important discussions newlyweds can have is whether and how to merge their finances. It can be a fraught conversation, as research shows that \nmoney is a leading cause of arguments between partners\n.\nResearch from Kellogg\u2019s \nEli Finkel\n shows one way couples can help preserve their relationship during those critical first years of marriage: by going all in on a joint bank account.\n \nFinkel and his coauthors found that a joint bank account can help couples align their financial goals and adhere to communal norms, rather than behave in a more transactional way. If all money is everyone\u2019s money, then partners don\u2019t need to keep score.\n\u201cThe newlywed years are considered the \u2018connubial crucible.\u2019 That means the dynamics that couples develop in those years predict how their relationship will progress thereafter,\u201d Finkel explains. \u201cWe wanted to take that crucial period and see if we could use bank-account structure to alter how satisfied couples are in their relationships. And we found that we could.\u201d\n2. \nSorry, Stevie: maybe superstition \nis\n the way.\nWhen Kellogg\u2019s \nKieu-Trang Nguyen\n got married, she and her husband didn\u2019t consult the stars to see if they were compatible. But they have plenty of Vietnamese family and friends who did\u2014using Tu Vi, an ancient belief system that offers individuals and couples predictions about future events, such as marriages, births, deaths, business prospects, and travels.\nAs a scholar, Nguyen wanted to know how much these beliefs really matter to couples when it comes to making marriage decisions and whether auspicious marriages fare better.\nHer recent research reveals that couples in auspicious marriages benefit in measurable ways: they earn more and have a higher standard of living, for example, and their children are less likely to drop out of school.\nWhich is not to say that the stars were necessarily right in their predictions. Nguyen says that there\u2019s a self-fulfilling prophecy at work: when a couple\u2019s social circle believes a marriage is auspicious, they are more likely to step in and offer help, buoying the couple through hard times.\n3. \nWhom you marry has important economic effects\u2014beyond your own household. \nWas your spouse\u2019s ambition something you noticed when you were dating? If so, research by Kellogg\u2019s \nBenjamin Friedrich\n suggests you aren\u2019t alone.\nIn particular, Friedrich and his coauthors looked at what is called educational ambition\u2014the starting wages and wage-growth trajectories associated with various educational programs. Using administrative data from Denmark from 1980 to 2018, the researchers found that over the past forty years, couples have become more likely to self-select into marriages with partners in the same ambition category.\nThey estimated that this trend explains more than 40 percent of increasing income inequality since 1980. And the widening gap is driven partly by people in the highest ambition group, who are the most likely to marry one another\u2014and who also earn more than they did four decades ago.\nSo when it comes to couples\u2019\u2014and countries\u2019\u2014financial outcomes, \u201cmarital sorting is becoming more and more important,\u201d Friedrich says.\nThe Super Bowl\u2019s superb ads\nOK, enough of the love stuff.\nFor 20 years, Kellogg\u2019s \nDerek Rucker\n and \nTim Calkins\n have gathered students together to grade Super Bowl ads. Rather than rating them based on solely cleverness or likability\u2014like many of us casual fans do\u2014they use a framework developed by Rucker called \nADPLAN, which measures attention, distinction, positioning, linkage, amplification, and net equity\n. \nIn 2024, the students\u2019 overall winner was Google Pixel for its \u201cJavier in Frame\u201d spot. Like the Kansas City Chiefs, Google took the crown for the second year in a row; its \u201cFixed on Pixel\u201d spot was the 2023 Super Bowl Ad Review winner.\n\u201cGoogle Pixel has clearly figured out the formula to success for advertising in the Super Bowl,\u201d Rucker said after the event. \u201cOnce again the company was able to demonstrate a new technology that enhances the user experience, while also connecting with viewers in an unexpected, emotional way.\u201d \nOther brands that earned top marks included Mountain Dew\u2019s \u201cHaving A Blast\u201d and Dove\u2019s \u201cHard Knocks.\u201d\nOverall, \u201cit was a great year for advertising, and we saw very few brands miss the mark,\u201d Calkins said. \u201cSpots attracted attention with strong linkage, solid branding and utilized \u2018celebrity wow.\u2019\u201d \nAnd if the two organizers had gotten a vote? In \na webinar on Monday\n, Rucker said his favorites were CeraVe and Reese\u2019s, while Calkins gave the nod to Microsoft, Etsy, and Poppi.\nRead more about the Super Bowl Ad Review and this year\u2019s results \nhere\n.\n\u201cIf we are intentional and more inclusive with future growth, we could all but close the wealth gap for the majority of Black Americans.\u201d\n\u2014 Kellogg senior fellow \nDwight Hutchins\n, speaking at the Kellogg and Northwestern Mutual \nGather Against the Gap event\n, which focused on strategies to close the U.S.\u2019s $10 trillion racial wealth gap.\nSee you next week! \nSusie Allen, senior research editor\nKellogg Insight\n\u00a0 \nYou should follow us on \nTwitter\n or \nLinkedIn\n.\nAnd listen to our \npodcasts\n.\nFeedback\n \u00a0\u00b7\u00a0 \nUnsubscribe\n \u00a0\u00b7\u00a0 \nAbout Us\n\u00a9 Kellogg School of Management, Northwestern University.",

    "body": "You don't often get email from johns@drjohnsullivan.com. \nLearn why this is important\nMost resume scans are shallow, so they pass over factors that reveal if a candidate is exceptional.\n \n \nShare\n \n \nShare\n \n \nTweet\n \nLATEST ARTICLE\n \nDiscover Exceptional Candidates \u2013 Scan Resumes For These Talent Indicators\nMost resume scans are shallow, so they pass over factors that reveal if a candidate is exceptional.\u00a0\nDescriptors\u00a0\n| Recruiting/Resume screening \u2013 Talent indicators \u2013 How-to \u2013 5 min read\nWhy Most Resume Scanning Approaches Fail To Identify Exceptional Candidates\nMost traditional resume-scanning processes come up short. They are designed primarily only to identify the job selection requirements that each candidate meets. However, in the cases where you must hire an exceptional candidate, these scans are painfully inadequate. Most of these scans literally \u201cpass over\u201d and fail to record the resume talent factors that indicate when a candidate is exceptional because they have Advanced Talent Capabilities (ATC). These advanced capabilities can include the ability to innovate, learn rapidly, be an early adopter of technology, and have broad industry contacts. And, of course, it is important to realize upfront. Identifying these ATC factors is critical for great hiring because having only a handful of these ATC factors will upgrade a merely qualified candidate\u2026 to an exceptional one.\nThe \u201cAdvanced Talent Capability\u201d Indicators That You Must Identify\nDuring the decades I taught a master class in aggressive recruiting, I continually asked participating hiring managers and recruiters to look beyond the basic selection criteria for a job (i.e., job skills, experience, and credentials). And to identify the advanced capabilities that would make any new hire truly exceptional. So, I now recommend that everyone include a process for identifying them during all human and software resume scans and interviews. The highest impact ATC factors appear early in this following list.\nThey focus on their accomplishments\n\u00a0\u2013 rather than only listing their duties and skills. An exceptional candidate names and then highlights each of their major accomplishments. Highlighting these accomplishments demonstrates that they are results-oriented and provide every one of their deliverables.\n\u00a0An example of content to look for:\u00a0\nI reached 100% of the xyz project goals, including its on-time and under-budget metrics. The director noted that it was the #1 team accomplishment all year. As a result, I was nominated for and won the Employee of the Year award!\nThey quantify their results and provide comparison numbers\u00a0\n\u2013 the language of business and executives focuses on numbers and dollars. So, the best candidates use numbers throughout their resumes to quantify their major results. And to make comparisons between the accomplishments in different departments easier. They also include a dollar value estimate for each major accomplishment and a comparison number to show the extent of the change in the metric (i.e., compared to the average and the previous best and worst numbers).\n\u00a0\nAn example of content to look for:\u00a0\nI\n\u00a0\nimplemented changes to our quality control process that resulted in a 32% increase in output quality (valued this year at $106,000). Last year\u2019s increase in quality was only 12%, and its value was only $34,000).\nThey measure the quality of their work outputs\u00a0\n\u2013 exceptional candidates show that they understand the importance of work in product quality. They do that by reporting the quality of their work immediately after they have revealed the volume of their work.\u00a0\nAn example of content to look for:\u00a0\nI have been consistently ranked as the high-volume producer within the division. At the same time, it maintains a .001% error rate and a 98% customer satisfaction rating.\nThey reveal the quality of the organizations they worked for in their resume\u00a0\n\u2013 this may seem like a minor factor. However, the reviewer downgrades many exceptional candidates because they worked at a weak company or a mostly unknown organization. Automatically downgrading them would be a mistake if the individual worked in one of their most successful business units or teams. So, look for candidates that proactively educate the resume reader. By highlighting several indications of organizational quality (not the size) at each organization where they worked.\n\u00a0An example of content to look for:\u00a0\nI worked at the most innovative business unit at the start-up XYZ Technology. It was ranked #6 for product quality and innovation out of the 167 companies in our chip manufacturing industry.\nThey make it clear that they have worked with key people and the top organizations \u2013\n\u00a0because the best executives and vendors only want to work with the best. Exceptional candidates highlight the fact that they were chosen to provide input, advice, or work for your key executives. They also highlight that they were chosen to work with the best customers and external consultants.\n\u00a0\nAn example of content to look for:\u00a0\nI was selected by my CEO to be the only division employee who was appointed to serve on her strategic planning committee. I was also chosen to shadow the director of Google\u2019s strategic planning during his visits to our facility.\u00a0\nThey demonstrate that they are early adopters of technology\n\u00a0\u2013 rather than fearing new technologies, this candidate actively embraced them. And as part of their commitment and without being told. They demonstrated that they have continually researched, benchmarked, and reported to the team what they have learned about emerging technologies in their field.\n\u00a0\nAn example of content to look for:\u00a0\nAs\u00a0\npart of my self-directed, continuous learning on industry trends. I noticed that AI was projected to become a critical technology in our industry soon. So, I became an AI expert by first reading and then using my extensive industry contracts to benchmark our industry\u2019s \u201cemerging next practices\u201d in the area of AI. As a result, my recommended AI implementation plan was accepted within six months by a unanimous vote of the team.\nThey provide a web link to their actual work \u2013\n\u00a0resume screening and interview processes both have inherent weaknesses. Because you only read/hear a candidate\u2019s words. Even though, in many cases, the best assessment can only occur when an analyst actually reviews their work. So, you should consider it a positive factor whenever a candidate shows that they are proud of their work. By making it easy to access with hyperlinks to samples of the work and what they have written in their field.\u00a0\nAn example of content to look for:\u00a0\nWith the permission of my superiors, I published an online white paper covering the advantages of implementing AI in the sales function. You can gain access to it here on LinkedIn.\nThey demonstrate that they utilize data and metrics everywhere \u2013\n\u00a0Because a top growth area in most business units is to become a data-driven function. So, it makes sense for an exceptional employee to serve as a role model in developing that capability. Look for candidates that \u201cpepper their resume\u201d with the actual performance metrics that they used. And also to show how they have used data to support each of their important decisions.\u00a0\nAn example of content to look for:\u00a0\nBecause of my interest in and knowledge of metrics and data. Even though I didn\u2019t work in recruiting, I was assigned to lead the team that was developing success metrics for that function. As a result, the team developed, tested, and implemented recruiting metrics that covered the quality of hire, time to hire, the new hire failure rate, the cost of a weak hire, and the new hire turnover rate. The head of Google recruiting even called and benchmarked against our work.\nThey demonstrated that they are a serial innovator \u2013\n\u00a0in a rapidly changing world, few outputs are more important than continuous innovation. However, realize that it is often a mistake to only search for the word innovation (because others often misuse the word). Instead, search deeper and look for the actions and behaviors that reveal that an employee is really an innovator. Those actions include developing hypotheses, benchmarking, collaborating with others, experimenting, and learning from failure.\u00a0\nAn example of content to look for:\u00a0\nI created an internal learning group of outside-the-box thinkers with the goal of exploring how we could increase innovation in the sales area. Within three months, the VP formally sanctioned and funded the group. Later, I was asked to successfully develop and lead two other formal innovation groups (in customer service and WFH policy).\nThey admit failure, but they learn from each other \u2013\n\u00a0Teams that operate in a high-risk environment often fail. However, rather than not mentioning the topic, most exceptional candidates are instead open about their major work failures. The employee has used them as an opportunity to learn and improve.\u00a0\nAn example of content to look for:\u00a0\n\u00a0\nOur DEI team developed a new diversity training class for managers. Unfortunately, the reviews of the new class were embarrassing. But rather than waiting, I took ownership of the problem. And I subsequently collaborated with our engineering function\u2019s failure analysis team. And with their help, we identified the 2 root causes and the 6 critical success factors. In this case, we found that the #1 critical success factor always involved \u201cthe customer\u201d in the design and the final testing of all new classes.\nThe candidate is on the leading edge in their profession\u00a0\n\u2013 exceptional new hires usually require little formal training because they pride themselves on being self-directed, continuous learners. One of the ways that you can determine if a candidate is on the leading edge of knowledge in their field and business is by using industry buzzwords throughout their resume and during their interviews.\u00a0\nWhat to look for:\n\u00a0To stay ahead of our industry developments. I completed an online course covering industry trends. In it, I learned about currently hot and emerging subject areas. Including AI, Quantum Computing, Salesforce, Python, overhiring, blockchain, ESG and online team communications platforms\nThey take ownership of problems before others\n\u00a0\u2013 all good employees accept accountability for their area. However, exceptional employees go further and \u201caccept the ownership\u201d of problems no one seems to own. This willingness to act proactively obviously helps to accelerate the team\u2019s overall problem-solving effort.\u00a0\nAn example of content to look for:\u00a0\nI noticed that no one within our team seemed to be addressing our falling customer service scores. So, with my leader\u2019s permission, I alerted everyone that I was accepting ownership, which involved researching the problem and seeking their input on a solution. Within three months, our team leader thanked me for returning our customer service scores to normal.\nThey have business acumen\n\u00a0\u2013 no matter how strong a candidate is in their functional area. It is a fact that they will be able to provide much more additional value. If they are also strong in each of the important functional business areas. So, look for evidence that the candidate also has knowledge and experience in the business competencies. Customer service, selling, goal setting, leadership, metrics, finance, and problem identification.\u00a0\nAn example of content to look for:\u00a0\nEven though I was the youngest store employee, the store manager trusted me. She gave me the financial responsibility for store closing and the end-of-the-day cash reconciliation. During my tenure, we had only one day when, initially, the cash and the receipts were more than $10 out of balance.\nThe candidate will soon be promotable\n\u00a0\u2013 the most desirable candidates are often those who will soon qualify for a promotion. So, when you are assessing a promising candidate, make a rough estimate of how long (minimum and maximum) it will likely be until they are promotable. This assessment of their\u00a0\nlikely career trajectory\n\u00a0after they join your company will help to ensure that you will have a sufficient number of future leaders.\u00a0\nAn example of content to look for:\n\u00a0Have the resume review check their resume to determine if the candidate currently meets over 60% of the promotion requirements for their next level of job. If so, designate them as an exceptional candidate.\u00a0\nTheir resume includes powerful quotes\n\u00a0\u2013 resume screeners should be aware. Exceptional employees are constantly \u201ctalked about\u201d by executives, customers, and managers. As a result, they have received many positive quotes about their capabilities and accomplishments. So, you should expect exceptional candidates to repeat some of those positive quotes in their resumes and during their interviews.\n\u00a0An example of content to look for:\n\u00a0\nThe owner said he was completely impressed with my work at his gas station. \u201cThat he would fully pay for my college education\u201d (And he did).\nAdditional Indicators Of Candidate Excellence\nOf course, every organization has to identify its own set of ATCs that make a candidate exceptional. So, in addition to the above list, I have provided some slightly less impactful talent capabilities in this section. It may also indicate that you have an exceptional candidate.\n\u00a0\nThey are proactive\nThey have a global perspective\nThey quickly adapt to major changes\nThey are a problem solver\nThey are self-motivated\nThey move fast\nThey work effectively in a diverse team\nThey are consistently highly rated and ranked\nThey are an influencer\nThey make others around them better\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014-\nNote: When updating your own resume.\nMake sure that each of the advanced talent capabilities that you have\nare included and easy to find in a quick scan.\nIf you only do one thing\u00a0\n\u2013 From a recent key position opening, identify your preferred top seven capabilities from the Advanced Talent Capabilities list in this article. Next, capture the resume of a recent new hire in that job. One that you have already determined to be an exceptional employee. Thoroughly scan their resume to determine how many of your seven chosen capabilities were covered in that exceptional employee\u2019s resume. Next, do the same resume scan on an average candidate for the same job. Finally, compare the difference between the number of ATCs identified in each resume. These results should reinforce your inclination to develop a formal resume-scanning process that will more accurately identify exceptional candidates in the future.\u00a0\nFinal Thoughts\nUnfortunately, it is fairly common for resume reviewers to rely on their subjective judgment to decide when a candidate should be rated as exceptional. This \u201csoft approach\u201d often results in fewer candidates being designated as exceptional. So, instead, what is needed is a more systematic and objective approach that first identifies each of the important Advanced Talent Capabilities that are relevant to this job. Then, it develops a mandatory process for systematically and thoroughly scanning the resume for all indications of these capabilities.\nAuthor\u2019s Note\nPlease spread these ideas\n\u00a0by sharing this article with your team/network\n\u00a0and by posting it on your favorite media.\u00a0\nAlso, join the well over 20,000+ that follow or have connected with Dr. Sullivan\u2019s community on\u00a0\nLinkedIn\n.\nAnd, if you don\u2019t already subscribe to Dr. Sullivan\u2019s Aggressive Talent Management articles, you can do that\u00a0\nhere\n.\nMOST RECENT ARTICLES\nDiscover Exceptional Candidates \u2013 Scan Resumes For These Talent Indicators\nCompetitive Retaliation \u2013 When They Recruit Your Talent\u2026 Strike Back Hard!

Chances are, you remember it less because of the information it contained and more because of how that information was conveyed. \n\u201cTo be successful, it\u2019s simply not enough to have brilliant ideas. You must also be able to communicate your ideas clearly and concisely in order to persuade investors, stakeholders, and clients,\u201d says \nMichael Foley\n, a clinical assistant professor of leadership and communication at the Kellogg School.\nThis week, we\u2019ll offer some of Foley\u2019s tips for honing your message and connecting with your audience. We\u2019ll also share some research from \nMatt Groh\n, an assistant professor of management and organizations, on the use of AI in medicine.\nA balancing act\nMost speakers are either scripters or wingers, says Foley. Scripters stick closely to their talking points; wingers just, well, tend to wing it. Which method is more effective? According to Foley, neither. The sweet spot is in the middle.\n \nLeaders should aim for what Foley calls \u201cstructured improvisation,\u201d where you prepare your key talking points while giving yourself the freedom to express yourself in a natural and conversational manner.\n\u201cThe structure shows the audience that you\u2019ve done your due diligence and that you\u2019re going to be crisp, clear, and on point,\u201d Foley says. \u201cIt also shows you know where they\u2019re coming from, you\u2019ve anticipated some of their questions already, and you\u2019ve woven them into your content.\u201d\nWhen you master this technique, you can jot down notes on a napkin and talk effortlessly for twenty minutes or more, he says.\nSpeakers should also aim to strike a balance between objective and subjective evidence. Objective evidence\u2014data, statistics, charts\u2014helps you establish context and build a case, especially with technical audiences. Subjective evidence is best used to illustrate a point, such as relating a testimonial to demonstrate client impact.\nKnowing your audience can help you determine how much of each type of evidence you cite. For example, stories work well in business presentations or investment pitches, but might not resonate with analytical audiences such as engineers, PhD researchers, and accountants.\nYou can read the rest of Foley\u2019s recommendations in \nKellogg Insight\n.\nWhat AI can\u2014and can\u2019t\u2014do for medical diagnosis\nLike many fields, medicine is still figuring out how it will make the most effective use of artificial intelligence. While robots are unlikely to replace doctors anytime soon, it\u2019s easy to imagine a future in which the two work together. These physician\u2013machine partnerships hold particular promise for dermatology, a specialty in which diagnosis often comes down to recognizing the visual characteristics of a disease\u2014something that deep-learning systems (DLSs) can be trained to do with great precision. \nThere\u2019s even hope that machine learning could help address a known problem in the field: only 10 percent of images in dermatology textbooks depict patients with darker skin, meaning that physicians may be unfamiliar with the different ways diseases can present across skin tones.\nIn new research, Groh put the issue of machine-aided dermatology to the test by seeing how suggestions from deep-learning systems affected physicians\u2019 photo-based diagnoses. \nThe results were mixed. Assistance from even an imperfect deep-learning system increased dermatologists\u2019 and general practitioners\u2019 diagnostic accuracy\u2014but among general practitioners, the DLS exacerbated disparities in accuracy across light and dark skin. In other words, generalists supported by AI got much better at making correct diagnoses in light skin but only slightly better in darker skin.\nThe findings suggest that the best AI-supported dermatology might look different from how we currently imagine it\u2014and that DLSs and doctors are more powerful together than they are alone. \u201cIt\u2019s all about augmenting humans,\u201d Groh says. \u201cWe\u2019re not trying to automate anyone away. We\u2019re actually trying to understand how augmentation might work, when and where it will be useful, and how we should appropriately design augmentation.\u201d\nYou can read more about the research in \nKellogg Insight\n.\n\u201cWhat my research tries to highlight is that there are certain ESG factors and signals that can be taken advantage of from an investor\u2019s perspective.\u201d\n\u2014 Assistant professor of accounting \nAaron Yoon\n, in \nKellogg Insight\n, on the link between supply-chain ESG risks and stock prices.\nSee you next week!\nSusie Allen, senior research editor\nKellogg Insight\n\u00a0 \nYou should follow us on \nTwitter\n or \nLinkedIn\n.\nAnd listen to our \npodcasts\n.\nFeedback\n \u00a0\u00b7\u00a0 \nUnsubscribe\n \u00a0\u00b7\u00a0 \nAbout Us\n\u00a9 Kellogg School of Management, Northwestern University.",

    "body": "Plus: middle managers and over-the-counter markets. \nScared of AI? Here\u2019s an optimistic take. \u00a0\u00b7\u00a0 \nView in browser\n \nThe Insightful Leader\nBY \nKELLOGG INSIGHT\nLeadership advice from the Kellogg School of Management at Northwestern University\nGood morning,\nQuick: guess how many of the 270 jobs listed in the 1950 census have since been eliminated by automation. Are you thinking a quarter? A third?\n\u201cJust one,\u201d says Kellogg\u2019s \nHatim Rahman\n, an assistant professor of management and organizations. \u201cAnd in case you are wondering, \nthat job was an elevator operator\n.\u201d\nIt\u2019s a statistic that he wants us to keep in mind as we ponder the future of work\u2014and specifically, the \u201cfear that AI is going to suddenly lead to mass unemployment.\u201d Rahman spoke about how AI will affect our careers, and our society, on a recent \nThe Insightful Leader Live\n webinar. Today, we\u2019ll share some highlights from that discussion.\nChange happens more slowly than we think\nIf worries about AI decimating the labor force and taking away your livelihood have been keeping you up at night, Rahman has some words of reassurance: \u201cDecades of research shows that fear is unfounded.\u201d\n \nAs much as it \nfeels like\n technology is advancing so rapidly that we can barely keep up, it takes much longer for those advances to fully embed themselves in society. This will be true of AI, too. \u201cIt\u2019s going to take a long time for it to penetrate an industry, especially in ways that will affect your career,\u201d says Rahman.\nThis may be cold comfort to individual illustrators, translators, and journalists who have already \nlost some work to generative AI\n. But zoom out a bit, and it\u2019s clear that while these professions are the first to be affected by the technology, they are nowhere near obsolete. Instead, they are changing, as AI is gradually incorporated into various work streams and new infrastructure emerges to support it. \u201cThe more complex the technology, the more technical, human, and monetary resources are needed to develop, integrate, and maintain [the] technology,\u201d says Rahman.\nHow we use AI is up to us\nBy now you\u2019ve surely heard the argument that AI is neither good nor bad, but simply a tool. Much will depend, then, upon how we choose to deploy it. And, Rahman says, there is time for us to make this choice collectively and deliberately.\nWe can choose to use AI to replace as many workers as possible\u2014or we can instead choose to use AI to bolster talent and identify it in underrecognized places. We can choose to let machines make the bulk of the decisions around our healthcare, education, and defense\u2014or we can choose to keep humans at the helm, ensuring that human values and priorities rule the day.\nAnd it\u2019s not pollyannaish to think we\u2019ll actually have a choice. There are already areas where we\u2019ve opted to prioritize human involvement. Take aviation. Despite estimates that more than 90 percent of a pilot\u2019s responsibilities can be automated, our society has still decided to put well-trained pilots, capable of flying manually, in the cockpit in case things go awry.\nAutomation has worked out pretty well for pilots, says Rahman. \u201cIn fact, in aggregate, \nthe number of pilots and their pay has increased for years\n.\u201d\nTo learn more about how AI will reshape our world, \nyou can read more in \nKellogg Insight\n.\nTalking Point\nTo sell an asset for the highest price, you generally want to solicit offers from as many buyers as possible. The same goes for purchasing: the more potential sellers you approach, the better the deal you\u2019ll probably get. The benefits of competition are, after all, a cornerstone of economics. But in over-the-counter (OTC) markets\u2014or networks for trading securities not listed on formalized exchanges\u2014investors have historically sought few counterparties, something researchers have struggled to explain. A new study finds that OTC investors are motivated by concerns about front-running\u2014that is, when counterparties know what move an investor plans to make, they can take steps to raise or lower the price of that asset. Contacting few counterparties, the research shows, protects against this problem. \nRead more in \nKellogg Insight\n.\n\u201cHow do we let people go home from work at a reasonable time, disconnect at a reasonable time, not burden them with emails on the weekends, on vacations, after hours?\u201d\n\u2014 Professor of management and organizations \nAdam Waytz\n, on \nMarketplace\n, on the plight of middle managers and the importance of letting them unplug.\nSee you next week!\nSusie Allen, senior research editor\nKellogg Insight\n\u00a0 \nYou should follow us on \nTwitter\n or \nLinkedIn\n.\nAnd listen to our \npodcasts\n.\nFeedback\n \u00a0\u00b7\u00a0 \nUnsubscribe\n \u00a0\u00b7\u00a0 \nAbout Us\n\u00a9 Kellogg School of Management, Northwestern University.",

No, not like that. \u00a0\u00b7\u00a0 \nView in browser\n \nThe Insightful Leader\nBY \nKELLOGG INSIGHT\nLeadership advice from the Kellogg School of Management at Northwestern University\nGood morning,\nEarly in her career, \nEllen Taaffe\n got some advice she didn\u2019t like. Taaffe, who enjoys wearing bright colors, was told by her boss that her red blazers were making her stand out in the wrong way. She should wear a navy blazer, like the rest of her team.\nTaaffe, a clinical associate professor of management and organizations and author of the recent book \nThe Mirrored Door\n, has subsequently thought a lot about how we present ourselves at work. But at the time of the red blazer showdown, she didn\u2019t know what to think or do. Should she wear the clothes that felt right to her\u2014or accept this as one of those parts of herself that she doesn\u2019t bring to the office? \nToday, we\u2019ll delve into the thorny issue of personal authenticity in the workplace. We\u2019ll also discuss what happens when wealthy foreigners move to popular global cities.\nHow should you present yourself at work?\nIn the end, Taaffe didn\u2019t ditch her red blazers. And in \na recent episode of The Insightful Leader podcast\n, she explained that she\u2019s glad she stuck to her guns. It made room for other people to shed the unofficial navy blue uniform, too. \u201cSo I think that was helpful,\u201d she said.\n \nThere\u2019s been a lot of discussion in recent years about the importance of being able to bring our whole selves to work. There are a lot of good reasons for this, particularly when it comes to creating a workplace that feels inclusive to people who haven\u2019t always been included.\nBut it\u2019s also important to acknowledge that, fair or not, how we show up at work could affect how we are treated. \nFor instance, wearing pajamas at work probably doesn\u2019t send the right message about your level of professionalism or how much you respect the people around you. But dressing too fancily can backfire, too. Take this research from \nDerek Rucker\n, a professor of marketing, who has researched how people react to luxury brands. In one study, he found that mentioning high-status items can hurt job candidates applying for positions that require a lot of personal warmth (for example, human resources).\nRucker says he thinks about how he dresses more than he used to \u201cbecause I realized there may be unintended signals that I send,\u201d he said. \u201cAnd so I don\u2019t obsess about it to the point where it\u2019s like, let me think about every single item every single day. \u2026 But if I\u2019m meeting new people, I think a little more about what I will wear and how I present myself.\u201d\nSo, how do you decide when it\u2019s worth it to present yourself as you truly are\u2014and when not to? And how can managers create an environment where people feel safe to be themselves in the right ways? For more on how to thread these needles, \nyou can listen to the whole episode\n.\nTalking Point\nWho among us hasn\u2019t dreamed\u2014even just in passing\u2014about starting life afresh in some far-flung place? In recent decades, the decreased cost of air travel and the rise of remote work have made that dream a reality for some. Popular global cities, including Paris and Venice, have seen a surge of foreign arrivals from wealthy countries, laptops in hand and stars in their eyes, settling in for months or longer. For governments, the new arrivals pose a tricky challenge: they are a boon to local economies but also bring increases in rents, traffic, and congestion. So should new arrivals be discouraged or encouraged? \nNew research\n by finance professor \nSergio Rebelo\n tackles that question and finds a creative way to harness the upsides while minimizing the downsides. Specifically, he and his coauthors suggest taxing capital gains on property sales and using the revenue to help offset the harms caused to locals.\nRead more in \nKellogg Insight\n. \n\u201cA lot of low-wage occupations are going to be automated by AI, \u2026 and it\u2019s going to increase pay for occupations that use AI as a complement.\u201d\n\u2014 Professor of finance \nDimitris Papanikolaou\n, speaking at the \nAmerican Finance Association annual meeting\n, on how AI will affect the labor market.\nSee you next week!\nSusie Allen, senior research editor\nKellogg Insight\n\u00a0 \nYou should follow us on \nTwitter\n or \nLinkedIn\n.\nAnd listen to our \npodcasts\n.\nFeedback\n \u00a0\u00b7\u00a0 \nUnsubscribe\n \u00a0\u00b7\u00a0 \nAbout Us\n\u00a9 Kellogg School of Management, Northwestern University.",

That positivity also means they are uncomfortable with the criticism that comes along with failure. However, I find that perspective to be a serious miscalculation. Because \u201c\ncriticism is the engine of change,\u201d\u00a0\nit is beneficial as it harnesses outsiders (with fresh eyes) to help you understand every aspect of what went wrong.\nThe many benefits of failure include:\nIt makes you stronger\nIt tells you what not to do again\nIt forces you to innovate\nIt reveals the root causes of failure\nIt\u2019s an excuse to interact with executives\nIt keeps your ego in check\nIt illuminates the path to success\nIt forces you to focus on output quality\nIt provides you with fresh criticism\nIt forces you to use metrics and collect data\n\u201cIt\u2019s fine to celebrate success,\n\u00a0\nbut it is more important to heed the lessons of failure.\u201d\u2015\n\u00a0Bill Gates\nThe Eight Major Failure Areas In HR\nThe remainder of this article covers eight major failure areas in HR. And within each of these eight areas. I provide at least one \u201csnapshot data point\u201d supporting the argument covering why that HR area deserves closer examination.\u00a0\nHR failure #1 \u2013\n\u00a0New data suggests that\u2026 HR\u2019s current benefits expansion means higher costs but perhaps no real impact\u00a0\n\u2013 although HR leaders might not be aware of it. Since COVID, HR has essentially advocated a new form of\u00a0\ncorporate paternalism\n. HR has been striving to take care of more and more \u201cworker needs and wants.\u201d Even though meeting these new wants might not impact worker productivity or retention. So, in most of HR, it is still a common practice to propose and implement these new \u201csoft wellness benefits.\u201d Without any data proving that they produce the desired results and have a positive ROI (the dollars of business impacts outweigh the program\u2019s costs). And because these programs can be costly, the HR cost area that used to be called \u201cfringe benefits.\u201d Have now reached 30% of the average worker\u2019s paycheck.\u00a0\nConsider this new data a benefit\u2019s wake-up call\n\u00a0\u2013 unfortunately, the benefits function has done little to prove the business impacts of each of its offerings. But that omission is about to change. Fortunately, one major university recently concluded a comprehensive analysis covering the measurable impacts of 90 of these new \u201csoft\u201d benefit programs. The 90 different benefits that were analyzed include sleep apps and digital wellness solutions. Courses/seminars that cover coaching, mindfulness, massage, resilience, relaxation, time management, and financial health.\u00a0\nAnd if you have time to read this eye-opening study, you can find it by clicking\u00a0\nhere\n. Fortunately,\u00a0\nthe New York Times has summarized its results\n. The NYT reported that employees who participated in these 90 different programs\u00a0\nwere no better off\n\u00a0than colleagues who did not use them. As a result of this startling discovery, I recommend that every major corporation begin researching the employee saved, scheduled impacts, and the ROI of each existing or proposed HR benefit program.\nHR failure #2 \u2013\n\u00a0\nHR has still not been rated as strategic\u00a0\n\u2013 HR has continually failed even to get a majority of our business leaders to rate HR as strategic. And\u00a0\nnew survey data reveals\n\u00a0that HR\u2019s strategic rating has risen only a mere 1% since 2018. And our 46% strategic rating is, unfortunately, a full 21 points behind finance.\nHR failure #3 \u2013\n\u00a0HR is still not trusted by our employees\u2026 despite all of our efforts\n\u00a0\u2013 being fully trusted by your employees is a major goal of every HR function. However, a survey of major tech companies found\u00a0\nthat 70% of employees don\u2019t trust HR\n. And not a single one of these 18 top tech companies had a majority of its own employees say that they trusted HR at their company. And that \u201cdon\u2019t trust\u201d percentage rose to a whopping 83% at Intel.\nHR failure #4 \u2013\n\u00a0\nHiring, our most impactful sub-function, has a painfully high failure rate\n\u00a0\u2013 unfortunately, for years. The Conference Board has rated hiring as a top executive challenge in its annual\u00a0\nC-suite survey\n. The fact that hiring has remained a top challenge for so many years is by itself an indication of the failure of recruiting. The failure rate of new hires is a second failure area. Extensive research by Leadership IQ has revealed that\u00a0\nthe average hiring failure rate\n\u00a0is an astonishingly high 46%. And only 19 percent of new hires actually achieve unequivocal success. The third major failure area in recruiting has been the consistent \u201coverhiring\u201d over the last few years without effective workforce planning. As a consequence of this overhiring, many companies have been forced to initiate painful, large-scale, costly layoffs. The most essential remedial action for recruiting leadership is to begin measuring the on-the-job performance of new hires and the factors that accurately predict it for each job.\nHR failure #5 \u2013\n\u00a0Training and development produce expensive failures\n\u00a0\u2013 this function is among the largest spenders in the HR budget. However, research shows that an amazing 90% of individual training programs\u00a0\nfail to reach their targeted outcomes\n. This is partly because 90% of the provided content doesn\u2019t significantly change employee behavior. Therefore, 75% of\u00a0\nmanagers report that they are dissatisfied\n\u00a0with their L&D function. Instead, L&D must learn to calculate the ROI of each of its programs. Then, keep only the programs that have a direct, sustained, measurable impact on participant productivity.\nHR failure #6 \u2013\n\u00a0Our diversity results have been embarrassing \u2013\n\u00a0one DEI expert concluded, \u201cResearchers have studied the effects of diversity training for years, and they\u2019ve found a resounding theme:\u00a0\nmost DEI programs don\u2019t work\n.\u201d Other research supports this conclusion. Less than 2% of HR leaders reported that they were confident that they were\u00a0\nactually achieving their DE&I goals\n. Employees also support that conclusion because 62% of workers rated their\u00a0\nDEI programs to be ineffective\n. Today, with the increasing level of pushback on DEI programs, Now is an ideal time to make DEI a 100% data-driven function.\nHR failure #7 \u2013\n\u00a0Turnover has skyrocketed, but HR still has no answer\u00a0\n\u2013 HR\u2019s haphazard, mostly intuitive approach to stopping the great resignation has had little effect. Employee retention has remained the\u00a0\nnumber one operational priority\n. And perhaps the costliest turnover area is new-hire turnover. Research by BambooHR\u00a0\nfound that as many as 33% of new hires leave in the first month\n. And after three months, 68% of your new hires will have left. Instead, what is needed is a data-driven approach that identifies the major causes of turnover and the most effective tool for minimizing each cause. Employees also need to be prioritized for retention so that the highest-impact employees receive the most attention.\nHR failure #8 \u2013\n\u00a0The execution within HR also frequently fails\n\u00a0\u2013 unfortunately, HR often stumbles in its ability to execute. That problem is illustrated by the fact that 84% of HR professionals report that their\u00a0\nrecent HR Projects have been unsuccessful\n. And with such a high failure rate of new programs. Every HR function needs to research the\u201d critical success factors\u201d in successful HR operations.\n\u201cThe difference between average people and achieving people\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0is their perception of and response to failure.\u201d\n\u00a0\u2013 John C. Maxwell\nFinal Thoughts\nHR needs to learn from other innovators if it wants to become an innovative function. And that lesson is \u201crather than treating failure as an enemy, embrace it as a powerful learning and motivation tool.\u201d So, in that light, I find that the beginning of each year is the ideal time to examine and learn from last year\u2019s failures. A good starting place is to require each subprogram within HR to begin measuring and reporting its failure rate. The subfunctions to target include hiring, retention, onboarding, L&D, performance management, diversity, and internal movement. In my experience, HR can\u2019t become strategic until it first systematically identifies each of its major failure areas. And then, after each failure, it conducts \u201c\nfailure analysis\n\u201d in order to identify which factors contributed to each failure.\n\u201cI have not failed. I have found 10,000 ways that don\u2019t work.\u201d\n\u00a0\u2015 Thomas Edison\nAuthor\u2019s Note\nPlease spread these ideas\n\u00a0by sharing this article with your team/network\n\u00a0and by posting it on your favorite media.\u00a0\nAlso, join the well over 20,000+\u00a0that follow or have connected with Dr. Sullivan\u2019s community on\u00a0\nLinkedIn\n.\nAnd, if you don\u2019t already subscribe to Dr. Sullivan\u2019s Aggressive Talent Management articles, you can do that\u00a0\nhere\n.\nMOST RECENT ARTICLES\n8 Ugly Numbers\u2026 That Highlight HR\u2019s Failures\nThe Most Read Talent Management Articles (Dr. Sullivan highlights 6 simple recruiting tools)\nA Decision Filter\u2026 A Simple Tool For Making Fast Objective Program Approval Decisions\nNew Year\u2019s Resolutions For Progressive Recruiters (Simple but effective recruiting tools)\nRESOURCES\n \nStay Interviews and Other Powerful Retention Tools\nIn this brand new eBook, learn how to implement Stay Interviews, the highest ROI activity that any manager can utilize which\u00a0has been proven effective in keeping top performers.\nPURCHASE HERE\n \n \nOnboarding & Orientation Toolkit\nHave you been frustrated that it takes new hires/transfers longer than it should to get up-to-speed and become productive faster?

What happened? Are we really in the clear?\nThis week, we\u2019ll hear from Kellogg\u2019s \nJanice Eberly\n on the recession that wasn\u2019t and the general state of the economy. We\u2019ll also share some advice on managing the succession challenge in family businesses.\nWhat\u2019s going on with the U.S. economy?\nCast your mind back to late 2022 and early 2023: supply chains were still a mess from the pandemic. Immigration and labor-force participation were down, sending wages skyrocketing. Inflation was sitting at an eye-popping 6.5 percent. \nNo wonder economists were worried.\n \nBut, \nas Eberly told \nThe Wall Street Journal\n, \u201cthe U.S. economy was in a very different place than it is now.\u201d Those struggles\u2014with supply chains, hiring, and inflation\u2014all lessened over the course of 2023. \nThe \nJournal\n was covering the American Economic Association\u2019s annual meeting in San Antonio, TX. Among the experts there, the consensus was now that the U.S. is headed for a \u201csoft landing\u201d\u2014that is, decreased inflation without a recession. \nBut while a temporary sigh of relief may be warranted, there\u2019s reason for concern about longer-term economic prospects. In a presentation at the conference, Eberly argued that just getting back to business-as-usual won\u2019t be enough to jolt the U.S. economy out of the sluggish growth trajectory it had been on pre-pandemic. The U.S.\u2019s aging population, as well as global conflicts and changes to trade patterns, pose serious challenges to productivity that must be overcome to boost long-term growth. Top candidates for increasing productivity in the long term include AI, increased levels of immigration, and hybrid or remote work arrangements that keep people in the workforce.\nYou can read the whole article in \nThe Wall Street Journal\n.\nFamily matters\nBy some estimates, 90 percent of businesses are family-owned. And while few are as consistently Shakespearean as the fictional Roy family of HBO\u2019s \nSuccession\n, many have to navigate complex family dynamics in the immediate term to set themselves up for success in the distant future.\n\u201cFamily businesses need to focus on long-term resilience, which means preparing the next generation,\u201d says \nMatt Allen\n, a clinical professor at Kellogg and executive director of the \nJohn L. Ward Center for Family Enterprises\n. \u201cThat\u2019s a different time horizon than quarterly earnings.\u201d\nIn \na recent \nKellogg Insight\n article\n, Allen offered some tips on how family enterprises can build and preserve multigenerational resilience. \nFor example: don\u2019t delay planning for a leadership transition. \nIf everyone knows a decade in advance who will take the helm, the entire organization can prepare accordingly. \u201cWhat works terribly is saying, \u2018We\u2019ve got three kids and we\u2019re not quite sure who will be taking over,\u2019\u201d Allen says.\nIn addition to transparency and a measure of continuity, the value of choosing early is that the new leader will have time to build their own relationship with employees and customers, Allen notes: \u201cWhen you have a date already set and a ten-year window to work with, that makes everyone comfortable.\u201d\nYou can read the rest of his advice in \nKellogg Insight\n.\n\u201cWe\u2019re finally at the point where the regulator is willing to give us clear guidance in terms of what\u2019s legal and what\u2019s not.\u201d\n\u2014 Clinical professor of strategy \nSarit Markovich\n, on \nNPR\n, on the Security and Exchange Commission\u2019s approval of exchange-traded funds that will track bitcoin prices.\nSee you next week!\nSusie Allen, senior research editor\nKellogg Insight\n\u00a0 \nYou should follow us on \nTwitter\n or \nLinkedIn\n.\nAnd listen to our \npodcasts\n.\nFeedback\n \u00a0\u00b7\u00a0 \nUnsubscribe\n \u00a0\u00b7\u00a0 \nAbout Us\n\u00a9 Kellogg School of Management, Northwestern University.",

To me, the beginning of the new year is the ideal time to update your current recruiting practices and add a few new simple tools that require little training and no budget. To support the updating effort of recruiters and hiring managers, below, you will find my top five recruiting tools articles from last year. Each of the ranked articles has a short summary covering why you should use it and a hyperlink to the complete article.\nDr. Sullivan\u2019s Must-Read Recruiting Tool Articles From 2023\nOf the more than 50 articles that I published last year, here are the top five most often read recruiting tools articles (ranked by LinkedIn impressions).\u00a0\nThe 5 worst candidate assessment tools that you should stop using\u00a0\n\u2013 this powerful article lists and describes the five worst candidate screening tools that are still commonly used. It utilizes data to question common screening approaches like Myers-Briggs and candidate fit. So, if you want to stop the premature screening out of top candidates and improve your overall recruiting results. Click on this link to learn more about\u00a0\nthe worst screening tools\n\u00a0that you should no longer be using.\nShift to \u201cprofessional conversations\u201d to reduce the stress that occurs in traditional\n\u00a0\ninterviews\n\u00a0\u2013 this article highlights how excessive stress can dramatically reduce the interview performance of even the best candidates. And it suggests you should instead shift to professional conversations. These are less threatening because they strive to reduce it by turning an interview into a more informal conversation between two professionals. So, if you want to see more of the \u201creal candidate\u201d during your interviews. Click here to learn more about these proven\u00a0\nprofessional conversations\n.\nDocumenting your interviews will improve your recruiting results\n\u00a0\u2013 few realize how this simple effort to more completely document your interviews can dramatically improve your hiring. This easy-to-scan article highlights how simple actions (like documenting each interviewer\u2019s numerical score) can help you identify your strongest interviewers. And how, over time, this documentation will help you to continually improve your hiring results. Click here to learn more about\u00a0\nthe value of better interview documentation\n.\nEncourage interview screeners to stop initially searching for weaknesses in candidate resumes \u2013\n\u00a0this article highlights how many resume screeners overly focus on finding candidate weaknesses so that they can quickly reduce their intimidating stack of resumes. However, that search for weaknesses can be delayed or moderated. You will find that most excellent candidates and all innovators have made missteps along the way in their careers. This means that it is better to first focus on finding \u201cpoints of excellence\u201d in a resume. In order to avoid hiring only vanilla candidates who have avoided mistakes by doing little. Click here to learn more about the problem of\u00a0\noverly focusing on weaknesses in resumes\n.\nWhy \u201chow will you solve this real problem\u201d is the most revealing interview\n\u00a0\nquestion\n\u00a0\u2013 it seems like everyone is constantly searching for the one \u201cmagic interview question.\u201d Well, if there is one. Fortunately, the data and my own experience reveal that the single most effective assessment tool is to put the candidate \u201cin the job.\u201d Unfortunately, that is difficult to do prior to hiring. However, you can come very close to \u201cputting them in the job\u201d during their interview by verbally giving the candidate \u201ca real problem that they will face in their job\u201d to solve during the interview. Fortunately, by asking them \u201cto walk you through the steps\u201d on how they will solve this problem.\u201d You can better determine if they will take the right steps and which important ones they will omit when they actually face this real problem. These \u201creal problem-solving type of questions\u201d will by far give the interviewer the most insight into whether the candidate can actually do this job.

Therefore, in my view, this is the most important article that all progressive hiring managers and recruiters should both read and follow. It is:\nTime your hiring when the competition is low \u2013\n\u00a0my research has revealed that the most ignored but highest impact area in recruiting is timing. Because almost everyone begins recruiting immediately after a job comes open, that can be a major mistake. Obviously, you have a better chance of recruiting top candidates when you recruit during the times of year when the hiring competition is extremely low. For example, few major talent competitors actively recruit during Christmas or August when their hiring managers are mostly distracted or are on vacation. So this article highlights how to identify the times during the year when even companies with tiny recruiting budgets and a weak employer brand can successfully recruit top talent during times when this talent has fewer choices. Simply because the major recruiting companies were doing little or no recruiting during that time. Click here to learn more about\u00a0\nthe importance of timing your hiring\n\u00a0when the competition is low.\nMy Editor\u2019s Selection\u2026 The Most Impactful Recruiting Tool For 2023\nAmong the dozens of articles on recruiting tools that I published during 2023, my wickedly smart editor, Michael Cox, selected this article as the most impactful.\u00a0\nA simple \u201cwhat worked survey\u201d quickly improves sourcing\u00a0\n\u2013 this article highlights the importance of applying a \u201cwhat worked survey\u201d of applicants and candidates. In order to learn the most effective job posting channels, the most powerful attraction factors and the strongest employer brand factors. Once you have applicant feedback data revealing these factors, you can quickly and easily improve your candidate sourcing. Click here to learn more about\u00a0\nthis simple survey for identifying what worked\n\u00a0and what didn\u2019t work during sourcing.\u00a0\nFinal Thoughts\nIn a fast-changing world, where AI and Quantum Computing will literally change everything that we do in business and recruiting. Continuous, self-directed, rapid learning will be the key to survival in almost every professional job. So rather than fight it, prepare for it by developing a plan for continuously learning about emerging recruiting tools and best practices.\nThe remainder of my fifty-plus 2023 articles and over 1,300 additional articles covering strategic talent management and aggressive recruiting 155\u2019s tools can be found at\u00a0\nwww.drjohnsullivan.com\n.

    "body": "Plus: the cost of hiring difficulties and the value of teaching empathy. \nThe virtue of having fewer opinions \u00a0\u00b7\u00a0 \nView in browser\n \nThe Insightful Leader\nBY \nKELLOGG INSIGHT\nLeadership advice from the Kellogg School of Management at Northwestern University\nGood morning,\nPineapple on pizza: innovation or abomination? Coffee or tea? Bears or Packers? Heck, I don\u2019t even follow football, and I kind of have an opinion on that last one (which I will \nnot\n share, because I\u2019m not out here trying to lose half my readers in the first paragraph).\nPoint is, modern life forces us into a funny corner where we\u2019re all reflexively forming opinions\u2014even about things that don\u2019t matter much to us. This week, we\u2019ll hear about the virtues of having fewer opinions. Then we\u2019ll explore some new research that quantifies the impact of job vacancies on a company.\nA matter of opinion\nOver on \nLinkedIn\n, \nAdam Waytz\n, a professor of management and organizations at Kellogg, had an idea for an unexpected New Year\u2019s resolution: try to develop fewer opinions. Once a position is formed, Waytz writes, \u201cit can become an unwanted responsibility, an annoyance, or worse, a stimulus for conflict with those who hold different opinions.\u201d In fact, after quitting Facebook and Twitter, Waytz found that the biggest upside was not having more time, but rather having fewer judgments to manage. When you don\u2019t know about the latest tempests in teapots, you don\u2019t have to decide how to feel about them.\n \nAnd the real problem with opinions, Waytz explains, is that we form them really easily\u2014and then start fighting about them. His own research has shown that our brains process seemingly trivial opinions (e.g., \u201cwaffle cones make ice cream taste better\u201d) and politically charged moral beliefs (e.g., \u201cbuying clothing made with sweatshop labor is morally unacceptable\u201d or \u201cAmericans are ethically obligated to buy American cars\u201d) in similar ways.\n\u201cProcessing these pure opinions and moral beliefs (compared to considering factual statements) recruited brain regions involved in thinking about the self and the social world,\u201d he writes. This suggests that opinions are powerful in part \u201cbecause they reflect something about the self and what others think about us.\u201d\nAnd sure, debating some opinions can be fun. (To return to our very first question, I do, personally, \nlove\n pineapple on pizza and have engaged in many enthusiastic discussions about the overall merits of savory/sweet combos. Dip a fry into a milkshake and tell me I\u2019m wrong!) \nBut often, Waytz argues, such back-and-forth turns divisive and downright exhausting: \u201cThat so much of modern life is spent on digital platforms that ask us to upvote, downvote, subscribe, cancel, and provide a rating has further pushed us into a collective state of \nopinion fatigue\n.\u201d His advice? \u201cSurrender some of your likes and dislikes, and experience the freedom that comes with it.\u201d\nYou can read his \nentire post here\n.\nHow vacancies affect the bottom line\nWe all know that job vacancies cause headaches\u2014your remaining workers are covering someone else\u2019s responsibilities, your managers are spending their days sorting through a big stack of r\u00e9sum\u00e9s instead of taking care of everything else they\u2019re supposed to be doing, and productivity suffers. But quantifying precisely how much empty positions hurt firms financially is surprisingly tricky. That\u2019s because most data about recruiting difficulties come from small-scale surveys, which researchers can\u2019t easily match with information about the health of individual firms.\nA new study by \nMaddalena Ronchi\n, an assistant professor of finance, tackles this challenge by analyzing job-posting data from the French government. Ronchi and her coauthors found that doubling the time it takes to fill a job vacancy results in a 3 percent drop in profits; a company facing the average amount of hiring difficulty can expect a 5 percent drop in sales. And it\u2019s not just already-ailing companies that are vulnerable to these effects. \u201cEven productive, large, growing firms are negatively affected by this type of [hiring] friction,\u201d Ronchi says. \u201cIf anything, even more so.\u201d\nYou can read more about the study in \nKellogg Insight\n.\n\u201cDisagreement means richness of point of view, a wealth of ideas. So we want to keep that. But we want to prepare people to listen to different points of view.\u201d\n\u2014 Kellogg dean \nFrancesca Cornelli\n, on \nLinkedIn\u2019s This Is Working podcast\n, on the importance of teaching empathy.\nSee you next week!\nSusie Allen, senior research editor\nKellogg Insight\n\u00a0 \nYou should follow us on \nTwitter\n or \nLinkedIn\n.\nAnd listen to our \npodcasts\n.\nFeedback\n \u00a0\u00b7\u00a0 \nUnsubscribe\n \u00a0\u00b7\u00a0 \nAbout Us\n\u00a9 Kellogg School of Management, Northwestern University.",

Along the way, participants will be given the opportunity to examine their own experiences with emotion labor and reflect on their own more and less effective strategies for managing emotion labor. Participants might be interested in reading\u00a0\nThe Burnout Spiral: The Emotion Labor of Five Rural U.S. Foreign Language Teachers\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\nand/or listen to this\u00a0\n\u00a0\npodcast\n\u00a0\non emotion labor in preparation for the webinar; however, it is not required in order to fully benefit from the webinar.\n\u00a0\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nKris Acheson-Clair\nFormerly Georgia State University faculty and Fulbright Scholar to Honduras, Kris is a well-published scholar on intercultural competence, transformative learning theory, emotion labor, and assessment. Kris currently serves as director of Purdue University\u2019s Center for Intercultural Learning, Mentorship, Assessment, and Research (CILMAR). Under her leadership, CILMAR works with the university\u2019s faculty and staff both to put intercultural learning at the heart of study abroad and virtual exchange programs and to embed intercultural learning across the curriculum and student life in order to reach the entire campus. Kris and CILMAR also serve the field of international education by creating scalable experiential and reflective teaching materials, producing cutting-edge scholarship, offering professional development opportunities, and connecting people and resources in the Intercultural Learning Hub (\nhubicl.org\n).\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n \n \nAnnette Benson\nSince 2003, Annette Benson has served in a variety of administrative roles at Purdue University, including oversight of an ESOL program, HR training in diversity and inclusion, creation of integration and intercultural learning programs, management of the Intercultural Learning Hub, and public relations for the burgeoning CILMAR. Annette holds a Master of Science degree in strategic communication from Purdue\u2019s Brian Lamb School of Communication. She comments that one of the kindest things a supervisor ever did for her was to discuss emotion labor with her.\n\u00a0\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nNon-member Register \n \n \n \n \n \n \nUnsubscribe\n | Sent by SIETAR USA \n4880 Lower Roswell Rd, Suite 165 \u2022 Marietta , GA \u2022 30068",

    "body": "Plus: accepting advice and measuring ad efficacy. \nWhen perks come with a price \u00a0\u00b7\u00a0 \nView in browser\n \nThe Insightful Leader\nBY \nKELLOGG INSIGHT\nLeadership advice from the Kellogg School of Management at Northwestern University\nHappy New Year!\nI did some traveling over the holidays. Naturally, the minute I got back, I started thinking about my \nnext\n vacation. Destination: anywhere warmer and sunnier than Chicago right now. \nAnd like a lot of us, I wondered whether I could somehow game my credit-card rewards to snag a free trip. \nBut new research from \nLulu Wang\n, an assistant professor of finance, shows that these kinds of credit-card perks are actually costing us all. This week, we\u2019ll explain where all the freebies are coming from and why they aren\u2019t actually free. We\u2019ll also share some advice from Kellogg\u2019s associate dean of digital innovation, \nMohanbir Sawhney\n, on the art of accepting advice.\nNot so rewarding?\nWhy is it that credit-card companies seem so eager to give certain customers airline miles and cash back?\n \nWang\u2019s research shows that rewards are one of the best ways for credit-card companies to compete for customers. After all, as consumers, we have lots of choices about how to pay; rewards help companies achieve that coveted \u201ctop of wallet\u201d status. \nThe difficulty, however, is that credit-card companies fund rewards through the fees they charge to merchants. And in the U.S., those fees have gotten very high: about 2.2 percent of the total transaction cost, on average.\nFaced with higher fees, merchants can either raise prices, which affects customers directly. Or they simply eat the cost\u2014which makes them more likely to struggle and close. \u201cConsumers also take a hit from that, even if it isn\u2019t in the prices of goods that they\u2019re buying,\u201d Wang says. \u201cThere\u2019s one fewer coffee shop to go to or one fewer nice seller of clarinets.\u201d\nIt\u2019s also worth remembering that lots of Americans don\u2019t have incomes or credit scores that provide access to the most desirable credit cards. This means that debit-card and cash users, who tend to be lower income, are essentially paying for the credit rewards enjoyed by wealthier Americans.\nSo, can the system be improved?\nWang\u2019s study uses mathematical modeling to test several commonly proposed methods of doing just that. Capping merchant fees, as well as encouraging more debit-card usage, would be \u201cthe most robust policy,\u201d he says.\nMeanwhile, for consumers trying to decide how to feel about using rewards credit cards, Wang says there are no easy answers.\n\u201cThe rational consumer response is, do whatever makes sense for your own financial health and get the rewards if you want,\u201d he says. \u201cThe ethicist might say something like, would you be willing to put $100 in your pocket by stealing a penny from 10,000 people?\u201d\nYou can read more about Wang\u2019s research \nhere\n.\nWords of wisdom\nOver on \nLinkedIn\n, Mohanbir Sawhney, who is also a clinical professor of marketing, had some great tips on receiving \u201cthe gift of advice.\u201d (Psst, you can \nfollow \nKellogg Insight\n on LinkedIn\n, too. That\u2019s \nmy\n advice for today.) \nHere are a few of his recommendations:\n\u201cWould you be open to changing your course of action based on the advice you might get? If the answer is a firm no, then don\u2019t take advice! Readiness to embrace advice means taking advice with the intent to understand and possibly act upon it.\n\u201cGet enough advice so that you have a variety of perspectives and diversity of opinions, but not so much advice from so many people that you get confused and overwhelmed. More advice is not always better.\n\u201cAfter collecting advice, spend time to reflect. Synthesize the advice with your knowledge and values. Then, listen to your gut to decide the course of action. This will ensure that your actions combine the perspectives of advisors with your values and your goals.\u201d\nYou can read the whole post \nhere\n.\n\u201cAdvertisers fundamentally want to know what happens to somebody who sees the ad compared to somebody who doesn\u2019t.\u201d\n\u2014 Professor of marketing \nFlorian Zettelmeyer\n, in \nKellogg Insight\n, on the challenge of measuring digital ad efficacy.\nSee you next week!\nSusie Allen, senior research editor\nKellogg Insight\n\u00a0 \nYou should follow us on \nTwitter\n or \nLinkedIn\n.\nAnd listen to our \npodcasts\n.\nFeedback\n \u00a0\u00b7\u00a0 \nUnsubscribe\n \u00a0\u00b7\u00a0 \nAbout Us\n\u00a9 Kellogg School of Management, Northwestern University.",

    "body": "Plus: priorities for marketers and the appeal of Spotify Wrapped. \nIt\u2019s OK to talk about your charitable donations \u00a0\u00b7\u00a0 \nView in browser\n \nThe Insightful Leader\nBY \nKELLOGG INSIGHT\nLeadership advice from the Kellogg School of Management at Northwestern University\nGood morning,\nIt\u2019s the season of giving, so you\u2019ve probably gotten lots of appeals from charitable organizations hoping for that year-end donation\u2014or perhaps you\u2019re the one trying to raise funds for a cause you care about. If so, you know that getting people to open their hearts (and wallets) is no small feat.\nThis week, we\u2019ll share a few lessons from Kellogg faculty that can help you inspire more generosity in others and understand your own charitable impulses. We\u2019ll also bring you some highlights from a roundtable conversation with marketing experts on how the industry is adapting to a changing world.\nThe psychology of charitable giving\nHave you ever made a donation and been prompted to share the news of your beneficence on social media? For many of us, the proposition feels a little distasteful\u2014even though we know charities really benefit from the word-of-mouth marketing.\n \nFortunately, \nIke Silver\n, an assistant professor of marketing at Kellogg, has identified a way around this conundrum. By reframing the request to share as a way to promote the cause, Silver\u2019s \nresearch shows\n, charitable organizations can overcome the \u201cick\u201d factor and get more donors to spread the word.\nIn one experiment with the classroom-donation platform DonorsChoose, Silver and his coauthor tested what would happen if, in lieu of the usual \u201cshare\u201d message, the donors saw this instead: \u201cYour donation can start a chain reaction, but only if you tell others about the cause. Share this classroom with family and friends.\u201d\nThe research team found that donors who saw the new messaging were five percent more likely to click on a social-media icon. Critically for schools, the authors also found that because it increased sharing, the new message prompted greater donor recruitment and raised more money overall.\nSo don\u2019t feel shy about speaking out when you donate. In fact, Silver will be right there with you. \u201cAs I\u2019ve studied this more and more, I feel more willing to go out on a limb for charities I care about,\u201d he says.\nBuy some, give some\nAnother way to support causes you care about is to shop with a company that promises to make a donation on your behalf with each purchase.\nThis practice, called giving-by-proxy, has grown in popularity\u2014and even expanded outside of the retail context, with some companies dangling the promise of a philanthropic gift as an incentive for strong employee performance.\nAnd it turns out that giving-by-proxy engenders more giving. A \n2023 study\n by \nMaryam Kouchaki\n, a professor of management and organizations at Kellogg, found that people are more prosocial following a giving-by-proxy experience. \u201cThere\u2019s a spillover effect,\u201d she says.\nKouchaki and her coauthors uncovered this effect in several experiments, including one using Amazon\u2019s now-defunct AmazonSmile program. Under this program, customers shopped at an identical-looking website, AmazonSmile.com, where purchases benefited a charity of their choice.\nThe researchers gave participants an Amazon gift card and asked them to choose from one of six items to purchase, either via AmazonSmile or Amazon\u2019s traditional platform. Then, participants were told they would be entered into a raffle to win $50. Participants were significantly more likely to donate the potential raffle winnings to charity if they\u2019d shopped on AmazonSmile versus the traditional platform.\nThe message is clear: giving-by-proxy puts us in the mood to give more.\nWant to learn more about the science of do-gooding? You can read more in \nKellogg Insight\n.\nPriorities for today\u2019s marketing leaders\nThe pandemic ushered in seismic economic, technological, and social changes in the ways business is conducted\u2014and marketing leaders are at the forefront of a lot of these changes.\nThe \n2023 Kellogg Marketing Leadership Summit\n, co-hosted by Kellogg, McKinsey & Company, and Egon Zehnder, brought marketing leaders together in conversations focused on how they can build resilience for companies, teams, and themselves in the face of radical industry shifts. Three main topics emerged.\n1. Marketing leaders continue to wrestle with the influx of data that is available to their teams\u2014and the changing skillset required to harness it.\n \u201cA lot of companies are drowning in data, which has been around for a while. The best marketing leaders are staying focused on figuring out where there is the most value, and what is the job to be done,\u201d says Jeff Jacobs, a partner at McKinsey & Company.\n2. Marketing talent values flexibility more than ever before\u2014so marketing leaders are having to decide whether and how to accommodate this while still maintaining a healthy company culture.\n \u201cI hosted a panel of young people at an event recently and asked: How many of you would leave your company if you had to be in the office five days a week?,\u201d says \nJim Stengel\n, a senior fellow and adjunct professor of marketing at Kellogg. \u201cNearly all of them said they would leave.\u201d\n3. Building more-inclusive organizations continues to be a priority for marketing leaders\u2014but with so many other priorities, it\u2019s not clear whether the emphasis on DEI will continue.\n \u201cTo sustain change, the pressure\u2019s going to have to continue to come from both leaders and newer team members, but ultimately the tone of inclusivity has to be set at a leadership level,\u201d says Martha Williams, a consultant at Egon Zehnder.\nYou can read more about the future of marketing in \nKellogg Insight\n.\n\u201cWe really want to be part of the group, but at the same time we want to be different from everybody.\u201d\n\u2014 Professor of management and organizations \nBrian Uzzi\n, on \nNPR\n, describing the \u201cirresistible\u201d appeal of Spotify Wrapped.\nWishing you happy (and insightful) holidays! \nSusie Allen, senior research editor\nKellogg Insight\n\u00a0 \nYou should follow us on \nTwitter\n or \nLinkedIn\n.\nAnd listen to our \npodcasts\n.\nFeedback\n \u00a0\u00b7\u00a0 \nUnsubscribe\n \u00a0\u00b7\u00a0 \nAbout Us\n\u00a9 Kellogg School of Management, Northwestern University.",

    "body": "Plus: younger workers and China\u2019s zero-COVID policy. \nYour customer\u2019s mindset \u00a0\u00b7\u00a0 \nView in browser\n \nThe Insightful Leader\nBY \nKELLOGG INSIGHT\nLeadership advice from the Kellogg School of Management at Northwestern University\nGood morning,\nIf you\u2019re a marketer worth your salt, you\u2019ve probably thought deeply about your customers\u2019 needs and desires. But when\u2019s the last time you considered their \nmindset\n?\nA mindset is a mental state that affects how we interpret and respond to things in our environment. In a recent \nThe Insightful Leader Live webinar\n, Kellogg marketing professor \nAngela Lee\n walked us through some of the mindsets that shape our consumption habits. \nThis week, we\u2019ll share some highlights from her presentation, as well as some \nrecent research\n on the plight of younger workers.\nUnderstanding mindsets\nYou may have heard of mindsets in the context of education or career development. People with a \u201cfixed\u201d mindset tend to see abilities as set in stone: predetermined, perhaps by genetics. If you\u2019re bad at math or public speaking, you\u2019ll always be bad, because that\u2019s just how you are. People with a \u201cgrowth\u201d mindset, on the other hand, tend to see abilities as in flux, influenced by practice or training. With a growth mindset, if you\u2019re bad at math or public speaking, you believe you can improve your skills by taking a course or finding a mentor.\n \nBut there are plenty of other, lesser-known mindsets, too. Indeed, as Lee explained, research has identified several mindsets that impact purchasing behavior.\nComparison mindset:\n Having a comparison mindset ups our likelihood of purchasing something. This mindset can be primed by asking consumers to make a number of simple comparisons, like deciding which of two animals is faster. Then, when customers are presented with an array of say, chocolates, they are more amenable to making a purchase. \u201cThey have already skipped the step of \u2018should I buy chocolate or not?\u2019 They are already in the stage of, \u2018Which one should I buy?\u2019\u201d says Lee.\nAgreeing mindset:\n Being in an agreeing mindset\u2014primed by exposure to statements or ideas with which we agree\u2014makes us more open to consumption opportunities. We might be more likely to say \u201cyes\u201d to a pleasant vacation destination, or to a more exotic experience, like eating scorpions or starfish. Marketers would be smart to steer clear of programs or contexts\u2014or even controversial news stories\u2014where consumers are likely to disagree with the content as they pitch their products.\nDepletion mindset:\n A depletion mindset is triggered by acts of removal. Think: emptying our pockets, unpacking luggage, or dumping out a water bottle. In this mindset, we aim to conserve and replenish. This means we might be inclined to consume more snacks or purchase more goods, and we\u2019ll also be stingier when we are asked to share our limited resources with others. So a depletion mindset could lead to less charitable giving, for instance.\nWant to learn more about how to market with mindsets in mind? You can read about two additional mindsets\u2014or watch Lee\u2019s entire presentation\u2014\nhere\n.\nWhy younger workers just can\u2019t get ahead\nSince the 1970s, the wage gap between young and old workers has risen dramatically in high-income countries around the world. In the United States, for instance, the gap between workers over 55 and those under 35 increased by 61 percent between 1979 and 2018. What\u2019s holding younger workers back?\nNew research by \nNicola Bianchi\n, an assistant professor of strategy at Kellogg, suggests much of the phenomenon can be explained by older workers disproportionately occupying jobs at the upper tail of the wage distribution. With older workers occupying senior positions and few new ones being created, younger workers are stuck in low-paid positions.\nBianchi\u2019s analysis found that over time, workers under 35 have become more likely to enter the job market with progressively lower wages, and then see slow wage growth throughout much of their careers.\nThis suggests that their plight isn\u2019t simply the result of experience suddenly becoming more valued in the labor force. If younger workers were being disproportionately penalized for inexperience, you\u2019d expect to see them earn low wages for a while, \u201cbut at some point, they should gain more because they are getting more experienced,\u201d Bianchi says. \u201cBut we don\u2019t see that. For the first 18 years of their careers, they keep losing. Their wage growth over time is worse than what it used to be.\u201d\nYou can read more about Bianchi\u2019s research \nhere\n.\n\u201cWhen the government did finally finish lifting zero-COVID restrictions, the vaccination rate was still low among the elderly, and there was little time for hospitals and health workers to prepare for the one billion infections that soon followed.\u201d\n\u2014 \nNancy Qian\n, in \nProject Syndicate\n,\n on the long tail of China\u2019s zero-COVID policy.\nSee you next week!\nSusie Allen, senior research editor\nKellogg Insight\n\u00a0 \nYou should follow us on \nTwitter\n or \nLinkedIn\n.\nAnd listen to our \npodcasts\n.\nFeedback\n \u00a0\u00b7\u00a0 \nUnsubscribe\n \u00a0\u00b7\u00a0 \nAbout Us\n\u00a9 Kellogg School of Management, Northwestern University.",

As society continues to navigate the realities of systemic racism, Black communities have found ways to cultivate resilience through the use of collective care strategies. This webinar will\u00a0focus specifically on how Black communities utilize collective care in their resilience. We will discuss the use of culturally specific forms of protection, healing, and social support that have contributed\u00a0to\u00a0resilience among\u00a0Black\u00a0youth and adults. Additionally, the importance of allyship in creating a sense of belonging and support outside of\u00a0Black communities will be addressed.\n\u00a0\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nAbout Your Presenter\nDanice Brown, Ph.D.\nDr. Danice Brown is currently a Professor in the Counseling Psychology Graduate Program at Towson University where she serves as the Coordinator of Clinical Training.

    "body": "You don't often get email from johns@drjohnsullivan.com. \nLearn why this is important\nThe silliest practice in retention is counting all quits equally in your turnover calculations.\n \n \nShare\n \n \nShare\n \n \nTweet\n \nLATEST ARTICLE\n \nAll Turnover Isn\u2019t Bad\u2026 Encouraging \u201cGood Turnover\u201d\n(The positive impacts of good turnover)\nThe silliest practice in retention is counting all quits equally in your turnover calculations.\nDescriptors\n\u2026 retention/good turnover \u2013 eye-opening \u2013 how to \u2013 data-rich \u2013 4 min. scan\nUnderstanding The Different Amounts of Business Impact From Each Category Of Turnover\u00a0\nIt\u2019s a common practice to lump all employee turnover into one basket. This practice is silly and na\u00efve. With numbers and dollars, it\u2019s possible to demonstrate that all departing employees don\u2019t create the same costs and negative impacts. The first step in ending this misleading lumping practice is to realize that there are four distinct categories of employee turnover rather than just one. They are Devastating, Regrettable, Average, and Good Turnover in descending order of impact.\nFurthermore, everyone needs to know that each of these distinct categories produces a different amount of business damage. The top category, \u201cdevastating turnover,\u201d needs to be given top priority by managers. The damage that turnover in this category causes is\u2026 simply devastating! You can find my companion article on devastating turnover\u00a0\nhere\n.\u00a0\nHowever, because most executives and talent managers are completely unfamiliar with the category of turnover that I label as \u201cgood turnover.\u201d They need to be educated that this turnover category should be encouraged even though you are losing an employee. So, with that purpose in mind, this article focuses on understanding the different types of good turnover and the positive impact of each type. Good turnover is a case after a bad employee has departed. The affected team\u2019s business and people management results improve in the areas of productivity, morale, engagement, innovation, and team cohesion. Examples of good turnover can include the departure of a bad manager or a toxic, harassing, bullying, or disruptive employee.\nA List Of \u201cGood Turnover\u201d Cases With Their Positive Impacts\nIf you\u2019re unfamiliar with the term \u201cgood turnover,\u201d this turnover category has the fewest negative impacts. It can also be called positive, desirable, or beneficial turnover. In my experience, I have found that in many cases, at least 25% of all turnover should be labeled and counted as \u201cgood turnover.\u201d After your retention team identifies which of the possible 12 types of good turnover will be encouraged (each is listed below), the team lead should next work with HR to ensure in the future that individual managers are never counted off or penalized after they have had a case of good turnover (Please note that in the list of good turnover cases below, the most beneficial ones are listed first.)\nIt may be \u201cgood\u201d to lose a bad manager\n\u00a0\u2013 according to Gallup, at least\u00a0\n75% of the reasons\n\u00a0for voluntary turnover are influenced by the employee\u2019s manager. And no position does more damage than a management slot filled by a weak, poorly performing manager. You should also make everyone aware of replacing bad managers with above-average performing ones. They may have the highest positive impact of any retention action. As a result, you should encourage the voluntary or involuntary departure of bad managers. Those are rated as below-average performers (that are not significantly improving). As well as managers who fail to hire, develop, retain, and encourage the movement of talent effectively. So when a senior manager loses a bad manager under them, that turnover loss should be rated as a positive. So it shouldn\u2019t be counted against them.\u00a0\nLosing toxic employees will reduce team disruption\u00a0\n\u2013 research has shown that losing a single toxic employee to turnover will save a company\u00a0\nover $12,000\n. A toxic employee disrupts the team by harassing, bullying, discriminating, or threatening other employees or customers. So when a manager loses a toxic employee to turnover, that loss shouldn\u2019t be counted against them. Losing these toxic employees will improve team cohesion and lower your legal risks.\nLosing bottom performers will increase team performance\n\u00a0\u2013 bottom performers are costly because these employees may make up 15% of a team. Bottom performers can be identified because of their below-average performance appraisal scores, excessive customer complaints, below-average work output, or those on a performance management program that are not steadily improving. And in cases where effective recruiting replaces them with better-performing new hires. Their voluntary or involuntary departure will improve team performance and save termination hassles and costs.\nLosing an employee who behaves badly makes managing easier\u00a0\n\u2013 managing and counseling employees who constantly behave badly take up to one day of a manager\u2019s time each week. These bad behaviors include being excessively late or absent, having dangerous safety records, lying/stealing, and being referred to HR multiple times. Losing these badly behaving employees will improve team performance because others on the team will no longer have an excuse to copy their bad behaviors.\nLosing employees with declining skills will increase team capabilities\u00a0\n\u2013 in our fast-moving world, employees must constantly upgrade their knowledge and skills. So, it will likely benefit team performance when employees who are not continuously learning and maintaining or upgrading their skills leave. And the benefits increase even more whenever they are replaced by an employee that continually builds \u201cfuture skills.\u201d Of course, when everyone on the team is \u201cupskilled,\u201d team performance and innovation will both increase.\nLosing quiet quitters will increase team productivity\u00a0\n\u2013 Quiet quitters are employees who purposely do the very minimal amount of work necessary to avoid termination. When other team members see that quiet quitters are either forced out or terminated. Others on the team will be less likely to try to copy this damaging behavior.\nLosing your over-employed remote workers will increase team productivity \u2013\n\u00a0a remote employee who secretly holds a second full-time job is now labeled as over-employed (a.k.a. moonlighters). And when their second job significantly reduces their contribution to the team. Everyone will be much better off if they quit or are terminated because of this unethical behavior.\nGetting rid of a bad employee faster will help the team\u00a0\n\u2013 when a manager has the courage to formally terminate a bad employee. That should be considered a sign that you have a good manager with uncommon courage and decisiveness. And, of course, any turnover of an employee that has earned termination shouldn\u2019t be counted against a manager. And when a manager finds a way to encourage a bad employee to quit voluntarily. This will eliminate the delay often accompanying going through the typically long-drawn-out corporate termination process. And the fact that they quit may also reduce the possibility of a termination lawsuit. In order to encourage individual managers to terminate a higher percentage of bad employees, some large corporations have previously set involuntary employee release targets. They include Amazon at 6%, GE at 10%, and 17% at AOL.\u00a0\nThe early departure of a layoff target will save money\n\u00a0\u2013 when an employee who is highly likely to be included in an upcoming layoff voluntarily quits. You will reach your salary savings quicker. You will reduce the turmoil and legal issues and save the separation costs that would likely be incurred if the employee was actually laid off.\nLosing change blockers will speed up change\u00a0\n\u2013 some employees, especially long-tenured ones, may be set in their ways. As a result, these team members may be the primary resistors of dramatic change. So losing these \u201cthat\u2019ll never work\u201d employees will likely speed up the rate of overall change within your team.\nLosing the overpaid will result in salary savings \u2013\n\u00a0when a highly paid employee (i.e., who is well above the compensation norm) leaves. This creates a salary savings opportunity if you replace them with a lower-paid employee who produces at the same level. Losing the overpaid might also reduce conflict and jealousy among the lower-paid members of the team.\nEncouraging disruptive union organizers to quit will increase stability\n\u00a0\u2013 in a nonunion environment, those who go beyond normal organizational efforts can become disruptive even though you can\u2019t fire labor organizers. Managers who successfully encourage the disruptive organizers to leave shouldn\u2019t have their departure counted as a negative turnover.\nAnd Extremely Low Aggregate Turnover Rate May Not Be the Result Of Good Management\nOne final area of retention/turnover often misinterpreted is when your organization has an extremely low aggregate turnover rate in any of the devastating, regrettable, or average turnover categories. Extremely low turnover is defined as an organization with an aggregate turnover rate of more than 50% below the industry average (for an unknown reason, some call this phenomenon \u201czero turnover\u201d). In the cases when extremely low turnover occurs, executives and HR leaders often blindly want to pat themselves on the back. However, they need to be cautious. It is a serious mistake to automatically assume that this extremely low or single-digit turnover rate is occurring because your organization is well-managed. There are a multitude of weak talent management factors that may be actually causing this exceptionally low turnover rate. So, whenever you have an extremely low turnover rate, you need to conduct research in order to determine if one or more talent management weaknesses are causing that low rate. Below, you will find a list of weak talent management factors that may be stealthily causing your low turnover. The most likely causes appear first on this list.\nRecruiters are not targeting your employees\u00a0\n\u2013 your organization or team may have a low turnover rate because your competitor\u2019s hiring managers aren\u2019t asking their recruiters to target them. The reasons why your employees are not being targeted might include the perception that they have low skills or are not motivated. Another more serious explanation is that you have a weak hiring process that is only landing mediocre people.\u00a0\nIf your employees lack ambition, they will stay longer\n\u00a0\u2013 if the employees you recruit are not very ambitious or if your culture drains away their ambition. A lack of ambition will mean that only a small percentage of your workforce will be actively looking for new jobs.\u00a0\nAn older workforce will lower your turnover\n\u00a0\u2013 when your workforce has a large percentage of late-career or long-tenured employees. You will have a lower turnover rate because many of your employees will have decided to stay until they retire. However, even the non-ambitious won\u2019t look for a job externally. Unfortunately, you may experience another painful problem: a high rate of internal churn (transfers).\nFocusing on job security will lower turnover\u00a0\n\u2013 after nearly 2 years under a down economy. Your less secure employees may have made job security their top priority. Therefore, it wouldn\u2019t make sense for those seeking increased certainty to give up their current job security and go to a company where they would have no tenure.\nCompetitors have few open jobs\u00a0\n\u2013 even though they might want to leave. Your employees won\u2019t be able to if there are no open jobs to apply for in your region.\u00a0\nHousing issues may prevent movement\n\u00a0\u2013 high mortgage rates and housing prices limit employee movement. So rather than good management, housing issues may limit the number of your employees quitting to work in another region.\u00a0\nExample \u2013 your local post office might have an extremely low turnover rate. But only the na\u00efve would think that great management was the reason why so many employees stay so long.\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\nNote:\n\u00a0On 12/4/23, I published a companion article that extensively covers another important turnover category, \u201c\ndevastating turnover\n.\u201d You can access that article\u00a0\nhere\n.\u00a0\nIf You Need More Detailed Information\nYou can learn more about what\u2019s\u00a0\nwrong with most employee retention efforts\n\u00a0\nhere\n.\nYou can learn why you should\u00a0\nfocus your retention\n\u00a0on your high-impact employees\u00a0\nhere\n.\nYou can learn more about the cost of hiring and keeping a\u00a0\ntoxic employee\n\u00a0\nhere\n.\nFinal Thoughts\nIt\u2019s hard to find a more mismanaged and less data-driven HR area than employee retention and turnover. Executives are constantly sounding off about how \u201cbad\u201d employee turnover is. However, the well-informed already know that one category, good turnover, should probably be higher rather than lower.\nImagine this example of \u201cgood turnover.\u201d If you had a poor performing worker named \u201cHomer Simpson.\u201d Suddenly, without warning, Homer announced that he was quitting. Would you consider and then count his voluntary departure as a \u201cbad thing\u201d? Or would you secretly celebrate his departure? Even better, what if Homer left your company and immediately went to work for one of your direct competitors? Wouldn\u2019t that move to a competitor be an additional cause for celebration? So, at least to me, it is time to stop lumping all turnover into one basket immediately. Second, talent leaders should lead an effort to make managers fully aware of every possible \u201cgood turnover\u201d situation. Next, educate all managers on how they can effectively encourage more \u201cgood turnover\u201d occurrences. Finally, have your retention lead immediately begin working with your CFO\u2019s office to accurately estimate the dollar benefits each type of \u201cgood turnover\u201d can produce. So that every manager will know the actual positive dollar value of \u201cgood turnover.\u201d\nIf you only do one thing\u00a0\n\u2013 informally survey a handful of HR Generalists working with innovative and fast-moving teams. Then, ask each team member if they have experienced the departure of a single disruptive \u201cbad\u201d teammate. If they did, ask them to highlight the positive team changes that occurred within three months after that disruptive teammate left. Then, use any of the positive examples as ammunition for your business case supporting the exclusion of \u201cgood turnover\u201d from the traditional turnover count.\nAuthor\u2019s Note\nPlease spread these ideas\n\u00a0by sharing this article with your team/network\n\u00a0and by posting it on your favorite media.\u00a0\nAlso, join the well over 20,000+ that follow or have connected with Dr. Sullivan\u2019s community on\u00a0\nLinkedIn\n.\nAnd, if you don\u2019t already subscribe to Dr. Sullivan\u2019s Aggressive Talent Management articles, you can do that\u00a0\nhere\n.\nMOST RECENT ARTICLES\nAll Turnover Isn\u2019t Bad\u2026 Encouraging \u201cGood Turnover\u201d (The positive impacts of good turnover)\nAll Turnover Isn\u2019t Equal\u2026 And \u201cDevastating Turnover\u201d Produces The Most Damage (Prioritizing devastating turnover)\nHaving A Muslim Or Jewish Name\u2026 Might Trigger Hiring Bias During This Difficult Time (The name-blinding tool)\nTime Your Hiring\u2026 To When Your Recruiting Competition Is Low (The Candidate Per Opening metric)\nRESOURCES\n \nStay Interviews and Other Powerful Retention Tools\nIn this brand new eBook, learn how to implement Stay Interviews, the highest ROI activity that any manager can utilize which\u00a0has been proven effective in keeping top performers.\nPURCHASE HERE\n \n \nOnboarding & Orientation Toolkit\nHave you been frustrated that it takes new hires/transfers longer than it should to get up-to-speed and become productive faster?

We\u2019ll also highlight some new research that tackles one of marketing\u2019s oldest and thorniest challenges: figuring out how much customers are willing to pay for a product.\nThe right stuff\nAbout \n35 percent of startups fail simply because there is no real need for the product\n. For that reason, investors kicking the tires of a potential investment are looking for strong evidence that the new offering is actually necessary. Cast says primary research, in-market tests, and comparisons with existing products are some of the best ways investors can make the case for usefulness.\n\u201cI\u2019m listening for proof that there truly is a need, that the prospective customers aren\u2019t getting an itch scratched and this will do it,\u201d Cast says.\n \nOf course, this kind of proof can be particularly difficult for early stage companies to generate. And the more unusual or unexpected your idea, the harder you will need to work to show that the demand is there.\nOnce you\u2019ve convinced an investor of the need for your product, you also have to show that what you\u2019ve developed successfully addresses that need. Too often, Cast says, entrepreneurs are led by blind faith in what they\u2019ve made and don\u2019t have enough in-market research to support their convictions.\nRigorously testing what you\u2019ve made is crucial, and investors are looking closely at those tests. \u201cIt\u2019s really important to talk to potential customers during that discovery process and to approach those interviews and early product demos with a beginner\u2019s mind,\u201d Cast says. \u201cYour potential investor is going to ask you to talk about the research that led you to conclude you have product-market fit. Having real answers, real proof, is critical.\u201d\nYou can read all of Cast\u2019s advice \nhere\n.\nThe right price\nOne of the most important decisions firms face is which price to charge customers. Set the price too high, and you may fail to get any takers. Set your price too low, and you might achieve plenty of demand, but you\u2019re leaving money on the table.\n\u201cAt its core, this is a classic problem,\u201d says marketing professor \nDerek Rucker\n\u2014and over the years, many researchers have tried to crack \u201cwillingness to pay,\u201d or WTP.\nBut when Rucker and fellow marketing professor \nEric Anderson\n, along with Kellogg alumna Sharlene He, now a faculty member at Concordia University, surveyed the landscape, they found that current methods of estimating WTP had serious downsides.\nFor example, previous research has often found differences in people\u2019s WTP across different contexts\u2014for example, people are willing to pay more for a beer at a hotel bar compared with a beachside vendor. Yet many studies have measured WTP by simply asking people what amount of money they would spend on a product, without providing any details about the situation in which it is being purchased or the available alternatives.\nSo Rucker, Anderson, and He developed a new way of calculating WTP that overcomes these downsides. \u201cWhat\u2019s fundamentally different about our procedure is that rather than simply asking whether you would buy or not buy something, we first want an understanding of who the competition is,\u201d says He. \u201cWe want to ask, if you were not to buy this product, what would you buy instead? That\u2019s going to be the relevant comparison shaping someone\u2019s WTP. We don\u2019t assume that the answer is they would buy nothing at all.\u201d\nYou can read more about the researchers\u2019 new method, and the experiments they used to validate it, \nhere\n.\n\u201cThe most powerful combination is still a human\u2013AI collaboration.\u201d\n\u2014 Assistant professor of management and organizations \nHatim Rahman\n, in \nInc.\n, on how artificial intelligence will shape entrepreneurship.\nSee you next week!\nSusie Allen, senior research editor\nKellogg Insight\n\u00a0 \nYou should follow us on \nTwitter\n or \nLinkedIn\n.\nAnd listen to our \npodcasts\n.\nFeedback\n \u00a0\u00b7\u00a0 \nUnsubscribe\n \u00a0\u00b7\u00a0 \nAbout Us\n\u00a9 Kellogg School of Management, Northwestern University.",

    "body": "The silliest practice in retention is counting all quits equally in your turnover calculations.\n \n \nShare\n \n \nShare\n \n \nTweet\n \nLATEST ARTICLE\n \nAll Turnover Isn\u2019t Equal\u2026 And \u201cDevastating Turnover\u201d Produces The Most Damage\n(Prioritizing devastating turnover)\nThe silliest practice in retention is counting all quits equally in your turnover calculations. So the purpose of this article is to \u201copen your mind\u201d about the problem of measuring only aggregate \u201ctotal turnover. \u201d And why you must begin measuring, prioritizing, and focusing on the most damaging category of all turnover. Which I call \u201cdevastating turnover.\u201dAn example of devastating turnover would be, \u201cOuch, our AI team lead just quit and went to our competitor.\u201d The remainder of this article focuses on revealing the different types of devastating turnover as well as the tremendous costs and business impacts associated with each occurrence.\u00a0\nMost ignore, so they don\u2019t track devastating turnover.\nHowever, if you look at what recently happened when OpenAI lost a single high-value employee (i.e., Sam Altman, its CEO), that single-employee loss by itself literally cost the company and its strategic partner Microsoft billions of dollars in value. The lesson to be learned by others is to focus your retention efforts on reducing the costliest of all turnover: devastating turnover.\nDramatically Reduce Turnover Costs\u2026 By Minimizing Devastating Turnover\nMost corporate efforts to reduce turnover are spread broadly across all employees in the workforce. And that practice would make sense if the negative impacts of each employee leaving were equal. But in fact, some departing employees may be worth more than a dozen times the cost of losing the average employee. Fortunately, my research and practice have revealed that a whole category of employee turnover is so costly and impactful that it deserves special attention. I call these turnover cases \u201cdevastating turnover.\u201d By prioritizing the minimization of these devastating errors, an organization can literally cut millions of dollars of negative turnover impacts each year.\u00a0\nA List Of The Most Devastating Turnover Errors\nOnly the uninformed assume that all employee turnover results in the same economic loss. Devastating turnover is much more expensive than its one-level down turnover category, \u201cregrettable turnover\u201d (simply employees you prefer not to lose). I have found that as much as 20% of all turnover should be placed in this \u201cdevastating\u201d category. The top dozen turnover errors in this category are listed below (in descending order of impact).\u00a0\nNot calculating the cost of devastating turnover is the first catastrophic mistake\u00a0\n\u2013 some estimates put the cost of normal turnover at up to 1.5 times the employee\u2019s salary. However, I have found that these estimates are misleadingly low. They leave out the significant costs of team disruption and customer impacts. The costs of \u201cdevastating turnover\u201d are much higher than those of average turnover. For example, companies like Google and Apple have\u00a0\ncalculated the value of acquiring or losing a top employee\n\u00a0to be between 10 and 300 times higher than the value of an average employee.\u00a0\nPreventable turnover is inexcusable\u00a0\n\u2013 few realize that up to 95% of turnover can be predicted. And\u00a0\n78% of the reasons why employees quit\n\u00a0can be prevented by the employer (Meaning that three in four employee turnovers are preventable). So, each of the devastating turnover cases (in the following list) could have been prevented. Executives rate them even more egregious because most could have been prevented. Note: if you\u2019re unfamiliar with turnover causes that generally can\u2019t be prevented. They might include retirement, the family moved, a serious illness, returning to school, they started their own business, or they won the lotto. If you want to identify the real reasons why a critical employee has quit, the data shows that\u00a0\npost-exit interviews\n\u00a0(delayed exit interviews) can get as much as 50% more accurate answers on the actual causes of turnover.\u00a0\nLosing innovators can be the most catastrophic employee loss\u00a0\n\u2013 managers need to realize that those employees continually get their innovations implemented. Provide the organization with the highest value of any non-executive employee. In part because if they quit, their innovation projects will likely die after their departure. And they may rekindle their innovation at their new company. As a result, tracking and preventing \u201cinnovator turnover\u201d needs to be your number one retention priority. The costs of these losses should also be estimated.\u00a0\nThe loss of revenue generators will be felt immediately \u2013\n\u00a0realize that the loss of those employees that generate the most revenue (i.e., salespeople and business development employees) will immediately drop in revenue unless they are immediately replaced with an equal level performer. Note that if the revenue generator (and their customers) quit and go to a direct competitor, the losses will be markedly higher.\nToday, you can\u2019t afford to lose AI professionals \u2013\u00a0\nin a world increasingly dominated by AI technology. It is almost impossible to replace AI professionals who leave. So, anyone who has an impact on the use of AI must be considered a devastating loss. In addition to AI, most organizations are likely to have several other job families (i.e., data security and product development) that should also be considered critical.\nThe loss of critical executives may even hurt your stock price\u00a0\n\u2013 when a key strategic executive in a critical business unit leaves. It may startle your employees, get media attention, and even lower your stock price. So, at the very least, consider the sudden departure of the CEO, CFO, head of product development, and head of IT or R&D as\u00a0 devastating turnover. The loss of an industry icon that suddenly leaves your corporation should also be added to the devastating category.\nThe loss of any on the succession plan will hurt your leadership bench strength\n\u00a0\u2013 even if you ignore the amount of development money you have already invested in those in your succession plan. The damage will be doubled if those future leaders go to your competitors. The loss of succession plan members will also mean that your organization will have a shortage of leaders in the future.\nIt hurts to lose those with extensive contacts\n\u00a0\u2013 if you work in a business unit where relationships and professional contacts are essential. The loss of an employee with extensive industry and customer contacts will be catastrophic. It may take years to rebuild those contacts.\u00a0\nMinimize turnover in mission-critical jobs \u2013\u00a0\nif your organization designates mission-critical business units and/or jobs. Any turnover in these strategic \u201cgame changer\u201d areas will be highly disruptive and costly.\u00a0\nPrevent those with company secrets from quitting\n\u00a0\u2013 if an employee who knows a lot of company secrets or your master plan quits. And then goes to a competitor, the costs to your company will be extraordinary.\nWhen others follow those who quit, your turnover costs may double\u00a0\n\u2013 whenever a well-admired professional manager or employee leaves. There is a high probability that another desirable employee will shortly follow them. So, costs of any \u201cfollow them\u201d turnover losses must be included in the cost calculations of the original departing employee.\nWhere the departed employee ends up working matters\n\u00a0\u2013 last but not least, most fail to realize that it can be twice as costly when a departing top employee goes directly to one of your product competitors. Once they get settled at their new company, they will likely share their knowledge of many of your best practices (technically, they can\u2019t share secrets). It makes sense to track where all of your high-value employees land after they quit. This can be easily done on social media or by viewing their updated LinkedIn profile. And when one of your bad managers or toxic employees ends up at one of your competitors. In a roundabout way, your organization may benefit.\nAdditional Devastating Turnover Errors\u2026 That Have Slightly Lower Negative Impacts.\nIn addition to the top 12 most devastating turnover errors listed above, a few additional devastating turnover errors are producing a powerful but slightly lower level of business impact.\nUsing only a single turnover percentage will make it difficult to identify problem areas\u00a0\n\u2013\n\u00a0\u00a0\nAs I mentioned earlier, most organizations only calculate the aggregate turnover percentage (i.e., the percentage of all employees that leave during any year). However, relying solely on that single overall number will likely hide the real stealth damage occurring under the radar in important areas like \u201cdevastating turnover\u201d and diversity turnover.\nYou should also realize that when you count all turnover as bad. That may inadvertently cause some managers to try to eliminate all turnover. Even turnover that falls into the \u201cgood turnover\u201d category (e.g., when a toxic employee is let go or when a soon-to-be laid-off employee quits). I recommend revealing the separate turnover categories that fit under that all-encompassing turnover percentage. The additional turnover numbers you might need to report include devastating turnover, diversity turnover, performance turnover, new hire turnover, preventable turnover, and good turnover. For comparison purposes, it\u2019s also wise to estimate the turnover rates of your competitors.\nNot calculating the damage differential between normal and devastating turnover will cost you\u00a0\n\u2013 you will likely need a high level of executive support before they allow you to prioritize the turnover/retention of key individuals and jobs. The language of business is the dollar. I have found that the best way to get that support is to quantify all of the various turnover costs and impacts in dollars. Then, executives can more easily do side-by-side comparisons between normal and devastating turnover costs, as well as other common business costs. Incidentally, the best way to make your dollar estimates credible is to work with the CFO\u2019s office to verify the accuracy of your numbers.\u00a0\nLosing diverse professionals will be painful\u00a0\n\u2013 because almost all organizations struggle to reach their diversity goals in professional positions. The loss of a single, well-admired, diverse role model may trigger the loss of other diverse employees. This loss of well-known diversity professionals will also likely damage both future diversity and regular recruiting.\nLosing those in hard-to-fill positions will be painful\n\u00a0\u2013 losing an employee who works in an \u201cimpossible to fill\u201d professional position will be costly. And those costs will increase even further when the position takes a long time to fill or is never filled.\u00a0\nEmployees who are angry when they leave can have negative consequences\u00a0\n\u2013 losing a key employee to turnover is a major loss. But there is always a chance they will return someday as a boomerang rehire. However, when employees are angry when they leave, that anger /unhappiness may prevent them from ever wanting to return. So, the cost of eliminating their possible return must be calculated and reported.\nLosing key informal leaders on critical teams will be disruptive\u00a0\n\u2013 many don\u2019t fully understand the consequences of losing informal leaders where informal leaders are those unsung team members (without a leadership title). They build cohesion and get things done with little fanfare. So, losing even one of them on a critical strategic team will likely disrupt a team for months.\nIf you only do one thing\u00a0\n\u2013 find a cooperative executive. And informally ask them to list the most damaging instances of turnover that they can remember during the last year. And then see if any of those most damaging turnover cases were given extra weight in your turnover metrics. If not, you need to change your reporting to make future devastating turnover cases more prominent.\nFinal Thoughts\nIn my experience, it\u2019s hard to find a more mismanaged and less data-driven HR area than employee turnover and retention. This occurs even though executives are constantly sounding off about \u201cbad\u201d employee turnover. The complaints will continue until the turnover/retention effort first becomes data-driven and HR and individual managers are fully accountable for producing significant results.\u00a0\nHowever, after that, I have found that you won\u2019t be able to expect a significant improvement in your turnover results until you begin to identify and then prioritize the costliest segments of employee turnover. That means focusing on the most damaging types of turnover, which I call devastating turnover. Unfortunately, I have also found that executives still won\u2019t fully support this prioritization until HR puts a dollar amount estimate on the costs and the disruptive business impacts of devastating turnover. So executives can see and fully understand the huge differential in consequences between devastating turnover and regular employee turnover!\nNote: on 12/11/23, a companion article will be published on\u00a0\nmy site\n\u00a0that covers another important turnover category, \u201cgood turnover,\u201d which can actually produce positive impacts.\u00a0\nNote: If you need more detailed information covering what\u2019s wrong with most employee retention efforts.

As society continues to navigate the realities of systemic racism, Black communities have found ways to cultivate resilience through the use of collective care strategies. This webinar will\u00a0focus specifically on how Black communities utilize collective care in their resilience. We will discuss the use of culturally specific forms of protection, healing, and social support that have contributed\u00a0to\u00a0resilience among\u00a0Black\u00a0youth and adults. Additionally, the importance of allyship in creating a sense of belonging and support outside of\u00a0Black communities will be addressed.\n\u00a0\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nAbout Your Presenter\nDanice Brown, Ph.D.\nDr. Danice Brown is currently a Professor in the Counseling Psychology Graduate Program at Towson University where she serves as the Coordinator of Clinical Training.

    "body": "Plus: acing interviews and encouraging saving. \nManaging a worrier \u00a0\u00b7\u00a0 \nView in browser\n \nThe Insightful Leader\nBY \nKELLOGG INSIGHT\nLeadership advice from the Kellogg School of Management at Northwestern University\nGood morning,\nIt\u2019s natural for employees to wonder whether they\u2019re doing a good job and seek occasional feedback. But what should you do if you\u2019re supervising someone who needs constant reassurance?\nThat\u2019s one of the tricky management questions\n Harry Kraemer\n, a clinical professor of management and organizations, tackled recently as part of the \n\u201cAsk Insight\u201d series on The Insightful Leader podcast\n.\nThis week, we\u2019ll share his guidance\u2014as well as some tips on acing job interviews from \nLauren Rivera\n, a professor of management and organizations.\nHow to manage a worrier\nSo, what to do about a needy employee?\nKraemer says all employees\u2014whether they\u2019re worriers or not\u2014can benefit from understanding exactly how and when they\u2019ll be getting feedback about their performance.\nThis means that leaders should clarify for new employees (and remind old ones) how the process works. He offers this as a rough script: \u201cIn order for me to help you develop, I\u2019m going to be providing you feedback. Now, here\u2019s what the process is going to be like; here\u2019s how often we\u2019re going to do this; here\u2019s the rules of engagement of how this is going to happen; and we\u2019ll be very respectful of one another. So let\u2019s try that out. Let\u2019s see how that works.\u201d\n \nIdeally, clear expectations about how feedback will be delivered will go a long way toward reassuring that team member that \u201cno news\u201d doesn\u2019t in fact mean \u201cyou are doing everything wrong.\u201d\nBut if expectation-setting alone doesn\u2019t soothe your concerned employee, Kraemer recommends discussing the issue directly. Self-confidence is an important quality at work, and someone who frequently seeks praise or reassurance is probably lacking in it. Offering a simple message like \u201cYou\u2019re progressing every day\u201d can help a fretting employee realize that they belong where they are\u2014and that everyone has areas for improvement.\nIn this episode, Kraemer also weighs in on how to handle the unenviable situation of starting a new role and realizing the previous manager left chaos in their wake. You can listen to more of Kraemer\u2019s advice \nhere\n.\nInterviewing with ease\nIn her 2015 book \nPedigree: How Elite Students Get Elite Jobs\n, Lauren Rivera explored \nhow students from top-tier universities land jobs at prestigious companies\n. She drew on that knowledge in a recent \nU.S. News and World Report\n article about interviewing at law firms (although the same principles apply to many other kinds of interviews).\nFor example, many people expect interviews to be formal or structured, when in reality, they are more often freewheeling conversations. \u201cThey take you on a journey,\u201d she explains, so your best bet is to try to \u201cgo along for the ride.\u201d\nOf course, that doesn\u2019t mean you shouldn\u2019t practice, prepare, and nail the basics\u2014especially that all-important first impression. \u201cThere\u2019s data to suggest that interviewers decide if they are going to hire you within two minutes,\u201d Rivera says. \u201cStart off with your best ability. Appear friendly, confident but not cocky.\u201d\nYou can read more from Rivera \nhere\n.\n\u201cWorldwide, you have households that aren\u2019t able to save as much as they want to. Sometimes it\u2019s due to lack of trust in banks or having to travel long distances to access them. But if you\u2019re just saving money under your mattress, you\u2019ll be more likely to spend it than if you had it in an account.\u201d\n\u2014 Assistant professor of finance \nSean Higgins\n, in \nKellogg Insight\n, on how prize-linked savings accounts can increase financial inclusion.\nSee you next week!\nSusie Allen, senior research editor\nKellogg Insight\n\u00a0 \nYou should follow us on \nTwitter\n or \nLinkedIn\n.\nAnd listen to our \npodcasts\n.\nFeedback\n \u00a0\u00b7\u00a0 \nUnsubscribe\n \u00a0\u00b7\u00a0 \nAbout Us\n\u00a9 Kellogg School of Management, Northwestern University.",

    "subject": "Having A Muslim Or Jewish Name\u2026 Might Trigger Hiring Bias During This Difficult Time (The name-blinding tool)",
    "body": "Just seeing/hearing a candidate\u2019s name can cause them to be rejected because of unconscious biases.\n \n \nShare\n \n \nShare\n \n \nTweet\n \nLATEST ARTICLE\n \nHaving A Muslim Or Jewish Name\u2026 Might Trigger Hiring Bias During This Difficult Time\n(The name-blinding tool)\nJust seeing/hearing a candidate\u2019s name can cause them to be rejected because of unconscious biases. So, if you want to avoid religious discrimination, consider using one of the available name-blinding methods.\nIt\u2019s a mistake to assume that the current Middle East conflict isn\u2019t having a negative impact on recruiting. In today\u2019s charged political atmosphere, I have found that many are surprised to learn that something as simple as a Jewish or Muslim name on a resume can trigger multiple unconscious biases.\nUnfortunately, some employees will instantly use the candidate\u2019s name to trigger \u201cbad assumptions\u201d about the candidate. These assumptions can cover both the positive or negative characteristics of people with this type of first, middle, or last name. Many in recruiting are further surprised when they learn about the breathtaking negative impacts of these name-driven biases on the accuracy of your company\u2019s recruiting assessments and its diversity hiring.\u00a0\nMany assume that they can \u201cknow you\u201d based only on your name\nCandidate assessors/evaluators often make unsubstantiated assumptions about an applicant based solely on their name. These name-based assumptions can include guessing an applicant\u2019s gender, national origin, ethnic group, religion/values, and even age (because each generation tends to have different first and middle names).\nToday\u2019s Problem That Must Be Addressed\nA major current recruiting problem (and for the foreseeable future) occurs when some resume screeners misuse a candidate\u2019s name to guess whether they may be Jewish, Muslim, Arab, Palestinian, or Israeli.\nDepending on the screener\u2019s perspective, these unsupported assumptions will mean that some highly qualified candidates will have their resumes unfairly screened out because they may be from \u201cthe wrong side\u201d of the political spectrum.\nDuring this highly emotional time, smart recruiting leaders need to adjust their recruiting protocols to reduce these unwanted name-based assumptions. Fortunately, there are ways to minimize these name-driven biases.\nThe most commonly recommended approach is the electronic replacement of the names on all received resumes with only the candidates\u2019 initials. And even though this practice will startle some, research shows that redacting candidate names (a.k.a. name-blinding) will surprisingly improve both your overall hiring results and your diversity results.\nThe Surprising Difference That A Name Can Make\nYes, the impact that names can have during hiring is real and powerful. In fact, data from\u00a0\na comprehensive study\n\u00a0(conducted prior to the current Middle Eastern turmoil) clearly reveals the tremendous negative impact that an ethnic name can have on the number of diverse candidates who are granted an interview.\nThe data reveals the painful truth, which is when compared to the resumes that were submitted with Anglo-Saxon names.\u00a0\nMiddle Eastern\n\u00a0named applicants need\u00a0\n64%\n\u00a0more applications\n\u00a0to get an interview.\nJews\u00a0\nwho apply with Jewish names\n\u00a0\nare\n\u00a0\n26%\n\u00a0less likely\n\u00a0to get an interview.\u00a0\nIn addition to the biases faced by individuals with Jewish or Muslim names, it\u2019s essential to acknowledge and address similar challenges encountered by those who also face bias (the highest negatively impacted groups are listed first).\nChinese\n\u00a0named applicants need\u00a0\n68%\n\u00a0more applications\n\u00a0to get an interview.\nBlack\u00a0\napplicants need\u00a0\n50%\n\u00a0more applications\n\u00a0to get an interview.\nIndigenous\n\u00a0applicants need\u00a0\n35%\n\u00a0\nmore\n\u00a0applications\n.\nWomen\u00a0\napplicants are\u00a0\n30%\n\u00a0less likely\n\u00a0to be granted an interview (than men with the same characteristics).\nAt least to me. Each of these name-created-impacts are breathtaking to the point where they can\u2019t be ignored. Fortunately, a \u201cname-blinding\u201d approach can by itself simply reduce the biases created by a Jewish or Muslim sounding name. This name-blinding tool is especially important when the biases towards both of these types of applicants are at their highest.\nNo matter how hard they try in this currently charged environment.\nWhen a resume screener sees the name Mohammed or Elijah,\ntheir unconscious or conscious biases are likely to interfere\nwith their objectivity at every step of the hiring process.\nThe Many Benefits From Name-Blinding\nIf you expect to get executive support for this blinding practice. You\u2019ll first need to build an effective business case that will provide a compelling argument (for cynical executives and hiring managers) on the many benefits of this approach. The top 4 benefits include:\u00a0\nName-blinding will improve new-hire quality\u00a0\n\u2013 successfully implementing this effort will give your recruiting function a measurable competitive advantage in your industry. Because you may be the only company in your industry that is proactively reducing name-biases early on, at the resume assessment stage. And because this blinding practice will dramatically reduce the number of times that a resume screener wrongly assumes that a name was an accurate indication of a candidate\u2019s religion, culture, or national origin. As a result, many diverse candidates who would have previously been screened out merely because of their name will now be allowed to show their stuff during interviews. And with that added assessment, you will likely find things about these candidates that might override any initial biases. Diverse, high-quality candidates will stay in your hiring process much longer. The quality of the candidates on your final interview slate is likely to be much better, as well as more diverse. And that result will certainly improve your overall quality of hire.\nName-blinding will also increase diversity hiring\u00a0\n\u2013 when you increase the diversity of your new-hires. That will create many positive business outcomes. More diversity is needed in almost every organization because diversity hiring regularly fails to meet its goals (less than\u00a0\n2% of surveyed companies\n\u00a0report that they were \u201cconfident that they were achieving their DEI goals\u201d). So, any action that increases diversity will bring with it great economic value. Multiple research studies have shown that diverse workforces are more productive, more customer friendly, they make fewer major mistakes, and diversity enhances all aspects of company recruitment and retention.\u00a0\nName-blinding may also reduce diverse candidate dropouts\u00a0\n\u2013 when diverse candidates see that your company has taken proactive actions in order to reduce bias in their hiring process. That will likely stimulate many diverse candidates so that they will now decide to remain in your hiring process until the end.\nName-blinding will also reduce gender bias\n\u00a0\u2013 obviously, gender discrimination during hiring is a huge diversity and legal problem in almost every organization. Unfortunately, giving a candidate\u2019s first and middle names to your screeners provides them with an unnecessary opportunity to guess the applicant\u2019s gender. As a result, hiding both first and middle names will result in as many as 30% more women being invited to your interviews. And simultaneously, you will experience a reduction in your legal and compliance issues regarding gender.\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014-\nMore Things You Should Know About This Name-Blind Practice\nIf you\u2019re serious about name-blinding, here are some other important things that you should know about this tool.\nDon\u2019t hesitate because we all currently use some form of blinding\n\u00a0\u2013 blinding during recruiting is actually now quite common. For example, companies in most jurisdictions have learned to prohibit (or blind) the inclusion of a candidate\u2019s picture on their resume because of the many discriminatory biases that a single picture can trigger in resume screeners. Many companies also currently prohibit (or blind) in many other areas of resume content, including age, gender, marital status, hobbies, or sexual orientation information on resumes. Recruiting leaders should realize that obscuring the candidate\u2019s name will have the same positive effects that occurred after you banned pictures.\nAvoiding Jewish and Muslim discrimination may require the binding of additional information \u2013\u00a0\nin addition to obscuring names if you want to further minimize the chances of revealing a candidate\u2019s religion or national origin in their resume. You may also have to obscure their attendance at religiously affiliated schools, the languages that they speak, and any indications of where they live.\nYou should also consider a broader approach\u2026 blind-recruiting \u2013\n\u00a0many organizations are now beginning to go beyond their initial step of blinding names. Blinding additional demographic factors that are not job-related or may lead to unintentional discrimination. This broader category is known as blind recruiting, which expands the information that is blinded or prohibited. It also includes pictures, dates that could reveal age, ZIP Codes that could reveal where you live, the schools you attended, your grades, your hobbies, and the languages you speak. Note: If you need more details on this broader blind recruiting, they can be found\u00a0\nhere\n.\nBenchmark organizations to learn from\n\u00a0\u2013 organizations trying some form of this name-blinding strategy include Google, HSBC, Deloitte, KPMG, and the BBC.\nAlert others about this current level of bias\u00a0\n\u2013 during these turbulent times, in addition to reducing hiring biases. You should also make sure that managers and everyone involved in talent management are alerted to the fact that religious and national origin issues are now much more likely to occur throughout the workplace.\nDon\u2019t forget to measure the impact of name-blinding\u00a0\n\u2013 in order to successfully blind names, you will need a data-driven process. And after developing and implementing it. Realize that the last essential step is to measure the percentage of increase in your diverse applicants. That made it to the interview stage before and after you began obscuring names.\nIt\u2019s a mistake to assume that blinding can\u2019t continue during interviews\n\u00a0\u2013 finally, you must realize that some information can trigger biases, not just during resume screening. But also throughout the interview process. Below, you will find how you can do that. \nRealize that blinding can play a part during interviews\n\u00a0\u2013 cynics wrongfully assume that hiding the name of the candidate. Simply can\u2019t continue to be effective once you begin the interview process. But the cynics are wrong. Because there are many approaches and tools for blinding the candidate\u2019s name, face, and any bias-creating demographic information during interviews. Some of those techniques are listed below\u00a0\nContinue to substitute initials for names during interviews\n\u00a0\u2013 if you have been referring to a candidate with their initials. Continue that practice by altering your interview protocols so that everyone avoids using the name of the candidate. And instead, interviewers refer to each candidate using only their three initials (i.e., JJS). Obviously, also ask the candidate to refer to themselves with only their initials (i.e., hello, I\u2019m JJS).\nUse technology to blind bias factors during interviews \u2013\n\u00a0name-blinding clearly illustrates one case where technology can do things that employees can\u2019t. The first step in information blinding during interviews is to video stream each of your initial interviews. Because on video, the candidate\u2019s face and profile can easily be obscured. And if you don\u2019t want to develop a complete video interview process by yourself. There are now vendors like\u00a0\nSapia.ai\n\u00a0that offer complete blind interviewing packages.\nEliminate voice biases with voice modulation tools \u2013\u00a0\nbecause a candidate can reveal their age, gender, ethnicity, etc., with their voice. Some companies are already using voice modulation tools like\u00a0\ninterviewing.io\n\u00a0to electronically alter a candidate\u2019s voice in order to hide accents, age, and gender.\u00a0\nAlso, alter your face-to-face interviews\n\u00a0\u2013 and when in-person face-to-face live interactions are deemed to be necessary, realize you can interview/audition a live candidate behind a physical screen. For example, the\u00a0\nToronto Symphony Orchestra proved\n\u00a0that simply putting the candidate behind a screen wasn\u2019t disruptive at all and that this blinding practice could improve diversity hiring by as much as 50%.\u00a0\nWhat to do when personal introductions using names are part of your culture\u00a0\n\u2013 the most difficult aspect of name-blinding during interviews is the fact that most candidates wish to be able to use their whole name during interview introductions. However, you can still have those personal, informal introductions where the candidate can vocalize their real name during either face-to-face or video interviews by first telling the candidate that informal introductions will occur after the interview is over. After the interview, postpone those face-to-face introductions for a few minutes until after the interview scores have been tabulated. Because once that scoring is completed, the chance for name or face bias to have any real impact on interview assessment will have already passed.\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014-\nHow-To Remove The Names From Resumes\nIf you\u2019re serious about implementing this name-blinding practice. Here are some name-removing options to consider.\nMany ATS systems can blind bias factors\u00a0\n\u2013 your name-blinding solution may already be available to you. Many modern ATS systems (e.g.,\u00a0\nWorkday\n\u00a0and\u00a0\nPinpoint\n) have added this blinding capability for resumes that are stored in their applicant bank. In many cases, you can simply ask your ATS system to replace the name on the resume with the applicant\u2019s three initials. And when you have tons of applicants, the name can be replaced with an identification number that you assign.\nUtilize vendor software packages for blinding\n\u00a0\u2013 blinding is now a standard feature that is offered by recruiting software vendors like\u00a0\nBlendoor\n\u00a0or\u00a0\nCiphr\n. In addition to removing names, some vendor software can also remove pictures, addresses, education dates, and other potentially biased demographic information that you want hidden.\nManual removal\u00a0\n\u2013 if you have a small number of applicants. Obviously, you can remove the names and substitute their 3 initials manually. And when you have a small number of paper resumes, you can use a marker to black out every part of their name but their 3 initials.\nIf you only do one thing\u00a0\n\u2013\n\u00a0\nwithout telling anyone internally what you are about to do. Have a friend from outside the company submit 5 resumes that contain the identical \u201cclearly qualified\u201d content for one of your critical jobs that is currently open. The first resume should be assigned the name of an Anglo-Saxon male, while the second should have the name of an Anglo-Saxon female. The third identical resume should have a Jewish name, and the fourth should have a Middle Eastern-sounding name. And finally, the fifth submitted resume should have a black-sounding name. After the initial interview slate has been put together. Secretly check in order to see which of the resumes failed to make it on that slate.\nFinal Thoughts\nEven though the current Middle Eastern and Ukrainian conflicts are occurring in faraway places. Hiring managers and recruiters who work in distant locations. Still need to realize that the emotional impacts created by these conflicts will still be present in every hiring venue. Rather than assuming that there will be no impact on recruiting. Or that there is nothing that you can do about this name bias. Smart recruiting managers will instead take proactive actions to prevent these heightened emotions and their related biases from having any preventable negative impact on your organization\u2019s recruiting results.\nAuthor\u2019s Note\nPlease spread these ideas\u00a0\nby sharing this article with your team/network\n\u00a0and by posting it on your favorite media.\nAlso, join the well over 20,000+ who follow or have connected with Dr. Sullivan\u2019s community on\u00a0\nLinkedIn\n.\nAnd, if you don\u2019t already subscribe to Dr. Sullivan\u2019s Aggressive Talent Management articles, you can do that\u00a0\nhere\n.\nMOST RECENT ARTICLES\nHaving A Muslim Or Jewish Name\u2026 Might Trigger Hiring Bias During This Difficult Time (The name-blinding tool)\nTime Your Hiring\u2026 To When Your Recruiting Competition Is Low (The Candidate Per Opening metric)\nTake Advantage Of\u2026 This Year\u2019s Holiday Recruiting Pause\u00a0(\u2018Tis the season\u201d to be recruiting)\nWhy Isn\u2019t Your CEO\u2026 Also, Your Chief Recruiter?

Then, they can focus their recruiting during the times when they have the greatest chance of placing a truly outstanding candidate in a priority job.\nThis think piece\u2026\n\u00a0is designed to startle you\u2026 after you learn about the tremendous impact that the precise timing of hiring can have on your business and recruiting results.\nExample \u2013 Right-time hiring when the competition is low\nIf you need to hire an exceptional Santa Claus, You would use \u201cright time\u201d recruiting. To start, you would begin your active recruiting early, at the end of September. Well before the intense Santa recruiting competition that occurs during mid-November. And because you recruited early, while all of the great Santas were still available, you got an exceptional hire. However, because of this early hiring, you might have to pay the newly hired Santa for a few extra weeks. But those minimal added salary costs would more than offset. By the exceptional customer service experience that the best Santa you ever hired would provide. Also, note if you waited until early December to begin your Santa hiring. You would need to consider the cost of the extensive damage that the resulting weak Santa new hire would do!\nUnderstanding The \u201cHire When The Competition Is Low\u201d Strategy\nIt is a common practice to open a requisition immediately after a new position opens up. And in many cases, that makes sense because leaving some positions vacant will result in lower productivity. However, if you fill that position during a time when there is intense recruiting competition. The resulting lower performance of this \u201cweak hire\u201d will also cost your firm a lot of money. Not just during their first year but over the many years that this poor-performing new hire stays with your organization.\u00a0\nThis \u201cright time hiring\u201d strategy is effective because it helps hiring managers understand. That if they were to consciously delay their active recruiting for a few weeks or even a month. Until the time when the new hire is actually needed (i.e., their need date). Managers should know that this postponement could allow the manager to land many more high-quality candidates.\nThese superior results will be received because there are time periods (days, weeks, and months) when the number of available quality candidates is high. While simultaneously, the number of new competitor job postings is low. I call this favorable metric the \u201cCandidate Per Opening\u201d metric (CPO). Alternatively, it could be called the Candidate Availability Ratio.\nThe Candidate Per Opening metric is calculated as follows:\nIn this example, Recruiters would report to their hiring manager. The external \u201cCandidate Per Opening\u201d number in November was 12 (based on Indeed and CareerBuilder data). This would mean 12 available candidates for each recently opened job X. That would suggest to the hiring manager. The competition for job X candidates is now so low (the normal availability number is only 6). They should immediately start recruiting for job X.\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2013\nA List Of The Best And The Worst Times To Recruit\u201d\nIn this section, you will find multiple examples of when the timing of recruiting is critical. Incidentally, you can get more examples from Onrec\u2019s \u201cbest time\u201d research\u00a0\nhere\n.\nBest/worst\u00a0\nmonths\nDecember\u00a0\n\u2013 December is the most favorable recruiting month. During that month, the recruiting competition (candidates per opening) is generally the most favorable to companies. August is the next month when the recruiting competition is at its lowest. You can learn much more about December/Holiday recruiting\u00a0\nhere\n.\nDecember and June\n\u00a0\u2013 are good months because the number of new corporate job openings during this time is generally low. Hiring budgets and headcounts are often completely used up at the end of each fiscal year. So you can expect to see significantly fewer new job postings during the months of December and, to a lesser extent, June.\nJanuary (and September)\n\u00a0\u2013 January is the \u201cworst month.\u201d The recruiting competition (candidate per opening) is often the highest (i.e., the least favorable to companies). The second worst recruiting competition month is usually September.\nBest/worst\u00a0\ncalendar days\nJanuary 17\u00a0\n\u2013 Tuesday, the 17\nth\n\u00a0of 2023, was a good day. Because over the last year. Jan. 17 was the single calendar day\u00a0\nwhen the most applications were received by companies\n. Unfortunately, in 2023, this \u201cbest date\u201d fell on the Tuesday that followed \u201cBlue Monday\u201d. And that closeness may have driven a higher volume of applications (Because many argue that Blue Monday is the most depressing day of the year). But be warned that even though you may receive an abundance of applications on the Tuesday that follows \u201cBlue Monday next year. Those applications may, unfortunately, be mostly from disgruntled or even depressed candidates.\nMid-December \u2013\n\u00a0this can be a good time for recruiting salespeople. You can expect those employees who receive a large year-end bonus (\nespecially salespeople\n) to quit and immediately begin their job search right after they receive their bonus in mid-December. Fortunately, you can expect a high Candidate Per Opening number in sales jobs for the rest of December. During the several weeks between when salespeople quit in mid-December and until serious replacement recruiting can begin in early to mid-January.\nJanuary 4\n\u00a0\n\u2013\n\u00a0this single worst date over the last year was bad for recruiting. Because on this date, the highest percentage of new jobs were posted. So, the available candidates had the most job choices. And that meant that it was easy for them to miss yours.\nJanuary 1 and July 1\n\u00a0\u2013 these are bad days. Because these fiscal year beginning dates always signal the beginning of a surge in hiring. On these dates, companies release new headcounts. Unfortunately, you will need to watch two different dates. Although most company budgets begin January 1, others start their fiscal year on July 1.\u00a0\nBest/worst\u00a0\ndays of the week\nTuesday\u00a0\n\u2013 this day of the week is considered by most to be a bad day. It is the day of the week when the majority of new jobs are posted. This means that the competition to have your job posting seen by top candidates will be significantly higher on Tuesday. Incidentally, Tuesday is also the day of the week when companies receive most applications. So, ensuring that your job postings are up by early Monday morning makes sense.\nYou should\u00a0\nalso track\nMajor talent impact actions that your competitors take\n\u00a0\u2013 you should also monitor each of your individual primary talent competitors on a weekly basis. So that you can react appropriately whenever they suddenly reduce/increase new job postings because of a budget increase, reorganization, a merger, a hiring freeze, layoffs, or the annual company-wide shutdown.\nLet managers know which major talent competitor companies are actively recruiting \u2013\n\u00a0obviously, the most challenging recruiting competition occurs whenever there are only a few candidates for each open job. However, the talent competition may also be fierce at any time when the major industry talent competitors (with powerful employer brands) are actively recruiting. So, in addition to the numbers, many hiring managers would also like to be told. The names of the powerhouse firms in your industry that they are up against. Because they are also currently actively recruiting to fill your open job\nHow To Ensure That The Work Still Gets Done\nObviously, the current standard practice is to begin recruiting immediately after a vacancy opens up. However, if you expect a manager to delay their recruiting until \u201cthe right time.\u201d You\u2019ll first need to provide them with proven suggested actions that would allow them to maintain their existing work level while they wait to recruit. Some of the most effective \u201cfill-in\u201d approaches that you should consider include:\nAsk everyone to chip in\n\u00a0\u2013 when appropriate, ask your employees to temporarily fill in. Or to rotate through the job each week. This short-term help will result in them eventually getting a higher-quality teammate.\nAsk part-timers to work more hours\u00a0\n\u2013 where possible, one of your first fill-in actions. It should be to ask your part-timers working in that job to increase their work hours temporarily.\nPay overtime\n\u00a0\u2013 for nonexempt jobs. Ask your employees to work additional overtime hours. Until you can hire the highest quality recruit\nHire a contractor\u00a0\n\u2013 hire a contractor or a temp to work on the job on a month-by-month basis to ensure that the quality of the work is maintained.\nHave the manager fill in\n\u00a0\u2013 ask the manager to voluntarily fill in on a temporary basis. It will eventually allow the team to recruit a much higher-quality teammate.\u00a0\nMake it a development assignment\n\u00a0\u2013 make the work a development assignment. For an employee who needs to expand their skill level into new areas,\nReschedule the work\n\u00a0\u2013 when possible, rearrange the schedule of when the work will be done. So, those new work dates coincide with high talent availability.\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2013\nAction Steps For Implementing A Candidate Per Opening Program\nIf you decide to implement a system for tracking the external competition for candidates. Here are some action steps that you should consider as part of your implementation plan.\nAccept the role of providing recruiting intelligence\u00a0\n\u2013 your first step should be to realize that every externally focused business function already gathers and reports information about what the major competitors are doing. So, your next step should be announcing that recruiting is accepting the role and the accountability for gathering recruiting competitive intelligence.\u00a0\nBenchmark best practices\n\u00a0\u2013 before they undertake any external benchmarking. Recruiting leaders should first benchmark, work with, and adapt the best external intelligence practices already operational within their organization. Generally, recruiting leaders should target earnings from sales, marketing, and product development.\u00a0\nPrioritize the jobs you track\u00a0\n\u2013 although it\u2019s possible to conduct \u201cright time recruiting\u201d across all jobs. At least initially, it\u2019s best to prioritize your jobs (no more than 25%). And to focus on gathering recruiting marketplace intelligence on jobs with the highest business impact whenever they are filled with a top candidate.\nAssign someone to gather the competitive information\n\u00a0\u2013 obviously, someone has to record the number of candidates and the open job data. So, recruiting leaders will need to designate a recruiter (or even an intern) for each targeted job family. The role would be to gather the required weekly competitive information from your selected major job boards. For each of their assigned jobs, the recruiter will need to record the total number of newly posted similar jobs. And the number of candidates who have recently posted their resumes. Of course, if you are only recruiting locally, you need to only gather candidate and job opening data for your region.\nEducate hiring managers about the upcoming best/worst times\u00a0\n\u2013 in order to get managers to act. You will need a simple and straightforward reporting process that makes hiring managers aware of the best and worst times to recruit for their jobs during the upcoming quarter. The system should also have the capability of providing an \u201cinstant alert\u201d whenever the competition for a manager\u2019s job suddenly changes significantly.\nDevelop the capability to instantly start recruiting\n\u00a0\u2013 after you begin continually monitoring your recruiting competition. Recruiting leaders will soon realize that in order to take full advantage of any talent surplus before it quickly fades away. Your recruiting function will need to develop the capability to \u201cinstantly begin recruiting\u201d without any delay. Whenever a time frame of low recruiting competition suddenly appears.\nEnsure that a delayed requisition won\u2019t be taken away\n\u00a0\n\u2013\n\u00a0one of the primary reasons why managers fill their open jobs almost immediately is because they are afraid that if they delay, they might lose the position. So, the organization must have a policy that prohibits the elimination of \u201con hold\u201d requisitions only because the manager is waiting for a \u201cright time\u201d recruiting period.\u00a0\nCreate evergreen jobs\u00a0\n\u2013to ensure that a hiring manager can actually place any amazing talent they find during these periods of low talent competition. HR must support the designation of \u201cevergreen jobs.\u201d\u00a0 These are always open jobs that don\u2019t require a new requisition in order to actually hire a surprise candidate.\nDevelop a talent pipeline \u2013\n\u00a0your \u201cright time\u201d recruiting will be significantly more effective if your function develops a talent pipeline approach. That is because a talent pipeline makes it much easier for a company to hire critical talent even when there\u2019s no current opening. As an added benefit, this approach also makes it easier for you to \u201chold\u201d outstanding candidates for a significant period of time until they are finally placed.\nDevelop results metrics\n\u00a0\u2013 and finally, it\u2019s essential for recruiting leaders to develop metrics. Allowing them to convincingly demonstrate to all hiring managers how much this \u201cright time strategy\u201d has actually improved both the number and quality of new hires. As a side benefit for the recruiting functions struggling to become data-driven, using metrics to measure the level of recruiting competition can be a great start.\nFinal Thoughts\nEveryone has heard the phrase, \u201cTiming is everything!\u201d Serious businesspeople already know that timing is a critical success factor in almost everything a corporation does, from when to introduce products, advertise, and hold a price sale. But somehow, too many recruiting leaders have found a way to completely ignore the impact of timing in recruiting. In fact, you won\u2019t even see the topic mentioned in popular recruiting blogs.\nSo, for those recruiting leaders who have been in the dark about the power of timing and recruiting. This may be the most impactful recruiting article you read all year. Despite all that you recently read about the importance of AI and technology in recruiting, I found that the precise timing of your recruiting may have the fourth highest impact on recruiting results (After developing a recruiting culture, becoming a data-driven function, and developing a data-driven referral program).\u00a0\nIncidentally, you can learn many more details on how managers/recruiters can hire when the competition is low\u00a0\nhere\n.\nIf you only do one thing\u00a0\n\u2013\n\u00a0\ninformally during October, track the number of candidates per open job in one of your hardest-to-fill jobs. Then, check to see if that \u201cApplicant Per Opening\u201d number has steadily become more favorable after the Thanksgiving holidays. And then use that information as your \u201cproof of concept.\u201d\nAuthor\u2019s Note\nPlease spread these ideas\n\u00a0by sharing this article with your team/network\n\u00a0and by posting it on your favorite media.\u00a0\nAlso, join the well over 20,000+ that follow or have connected with Dr. Sullivan\u2019s community on\u00a0\nLinkedIn\n.\u00a0\nAnd, if you don\u2019t already subscribe to Dr. Sullivan\u2019s Aggressive Talent Management articles, you can do that\u00a0\nhere\n.\nMOST RECENT ARTICLES\nTime Your Hiring\u2026 To When Your Recruiting Competition Is Low (The Candidate Per Opening metric)\nTake Advantage Of\u2026 This Year\u2019s Holiday Recruiting Pause\u00a0(\u2018Tis the season\u201d to be recruiting)\nWhy Isn\u2019t Your CEO\u2026 Also, Your Chief Recruiter?

This webinar will\u00a0focus specifically on how Black communities utilize collective care in their resilience. We will discuss the use of culturally specific forms of protection, healing, and social support that have contributed\u00a0to\u00a0resilience among\u00a0Black\u00a0youth and adults.

    "body": "Plus: nonprofit hiring problems and the ages of entrepreneurs. \nAI comes with a big trade-off \u00a0\u00b7\u00a0 \nView in browser\n \nThe Insightful Leader\nBY \nKELLOGG INSIGHT\nLeadership advice from the Kellogg School of Management at Northwestern University\nGood morning,\nHave you started to incorporate ChatGPT or other generative AI tools into your daily life?\nIf so, you know the trade-off well: either accept the AI-generated output as \u201cgood enough\u201d or put time\u2014sometimes a lot of time\u2014into personalizing it so that it faithfully reflects your unique style or perspective. Kellogg\u2019s \nS\u00e9bastien Martin\n calls this AI\u2019s efficiency\u2013fidelity trade-off.\nThis week, we\u2019ll ask: What does this trade-off look like when everyone uses the same AI tools? We\u2019ll also discuss hiring problems facing the nonprofit sector.\nSocietal impact\nAs generative AI tools become increasingly popular throughout the population, what changes can we expect to see in the content we collectively produce? And how should managers be thinking about this?\n \nMartin, an assistant professor of managerial economics and decision sciences, teamed up with colleagues Francisco Castro and Jian Gao to \ninvestigate this question\n. The researchers built a mathematical model to simulate how individuals with different preferences might choose to use the technology and what those choices mean in aggregate. Here are four takeaways from their study:\n1. Using AI to create content will increase the homogeneity of what we collectively produce, even if we try to personalize the output.\n2. This content will also inherit any biases the AI may have acquired during its training process. In other words, the tastes and biases of a few AI company workers may ultimately permeate throughout society.\n3. The problems of homogeneity and bias will be compounded as AI-generated output is used to train the next generation of AI\u2014what the researchers call a \u201cdeath spiral.\u201d\n4. On a more positive note, however, the study suggests that creating interactive AI tools that encourage user input and facilitate manual edits can prevent the worst of these outcomes. That\u2019s because interactivity will help AI systems learn to better represent the broad range of styles and perspectives present in the population.\nWhile managers might not concern themselves with these societal-level impacts, understanding the fundamental trade-off between efficiency and fidelity will be key to maintaining the quality of what is produced. Says Martin, \u201cIf you put a lot of pressure, time pressure, on your employees, they will use the AI extremely differently than if you give them more time to be creative.\u201d\nYou can read more about this study in \nKellogg Insight\n.\nTalking point\nNonprofits are struggling right now to hire and retain talented staff, according to Kellogg clinical professor and executive director of Center for Nonprofit Management \nLiz Livingston Howard\n. Existing employees are burned out after the pandemic, and recruiting new ones is challenging due to the in-person nature of many direct services roles. Inflation is also taking a bite out of budgets at a time when staff are negotiating for better salaries and benefits.\nYou can read more in \nWallethub\n.\n\u201cPeople conflate the fact that someone has a successful idea and they are young. Some people are just good at entrepreneurship, even when they are young. What we found was that they also get better with age.\u201d\n\u2014 Professor of strategy \nBenjamin Jones\n, in \nthe \nFinancial Times\n, on his study showing that entrepreneurs peak later in life than is commonly assumed.\nWe\u2019ll be taking off next Wednesday to celebrate Thanksgiving, but we\u2019ll be back in your inbox the following week!\nJess Love, editor in chief\nKellogg Insight\n\u00a0 \nYou should follow us on \nTwitter\n or \nLinkedIn\n.\nAnd listen to our \npodcasts\n.\nFeedback\n \u00a0\u00b7\u00a0 \nUnsubscribe\n \u00a0\u00b7\u00a0 \nAbout Us\n\u00a9 Kellogg School of Management, Northwestern University.",

Smith of Brigham Young University.\nSure, companies have their own missions, Kouchaki and Smith write, but the real magic happens when employee and organizational purpose are distinct but aligned. This state, which they call \u201cpurpose congruence,\u201d allows both workers and firms to thrive.\nAs Kouchaki and Smith put it, \u201c[t]o achieve purpose congruence, employees should be allowed to make the company purpose their own\u2014to have a say in how they weave it into their daily tasks and integrate it with their individual purpose. But they should also feel supported in pursuing their own personal purpose, without the broad company purpose being a hindrance.\u201d\nAchieving purpose congruence\nSo, how can companies get closer to purpose congruence? Kouchaki and Smith suggest that recruitment and onboarding are ideal times to start the conversation with workers. \n\u201cDuring interviews, you might spend some time discussing what they want to get out of their job\u2014but dig deeper to get past their rehearsed responses,\u201d they write. \u201cIn initial training exercises, you might give them time to reflect on how their particular job can provide a personal sense of purpose in their lives.\u201d\n \nLater, managers can use this information to identify projects that both advance the company\u2019s goals and speak to the employee\u2019s deeper motivations. For example, a worker driven by building interpersonal connections could be the perfect fit to lead a new employee resource group, while one who seeks to overcome challenges might be tasked with handling a particularly tough client.\nYou can read the rest of Kouchaki and Smith\u2019s advice about purpose congruence \nhere\n.\nFinding your purpose\nIf all this talk about purpose has you feeling uncertain about your own, never fear! In a 2019 episode of \nThe Insightful Leader podcast\n, we talked to \nNicholas Pearce\n, a clinical professor of management and organizations and the author of \nThe Purpose Path: A Guide to Pursuing Your Authentic Life\u2019s Work\n.\nSome of us know what matters most to us in our careers right away. For others, it\u2019s a process of discovery. Pearce suggests that people struggling to pin down their purpose ask themselves a series of questions, including \u201cWhat is success to me? And, given that, am I running the right race?\u201d Trusted friends and mentors can also help you identify your biggest strengths\u2014which may be different than you think.\nThis process helped Pearce, who holds a PhD from Kellogg, realize that the expected path for someone with his degree\u2014a tenure-track job in academia\u2014wasn\u2019t for him. Instead, he crafted a career that blends teaching, consulting, and preaching, the three things he finds most meaningful.\nAnd it\u2019s OK, even common, for your purpose to change over the course of your working life. Finding your true calling (or callings!) \u201cis a journey that you have to revisit again and again,\u201d Pearce says. \u201cBut ultimately, there can be a very deep sense of knowing that you are truly in the right place, in the right role, at the right time.\u201d\nYou can listen to the whole episode \nhere\n.\nTalking point\nThe U.S. is feeling the heat, with average temperatures rising substantially over the last century and especially since the 1980s. So what might the rising mercury mean for the economy? A \nnew study\n of the U.S. manufacturing sector by associate professor of finance \nJacopo Ponticelli\n finds that temperature shocks hurt small firms more than large ones. In the short term, small firms face higher costs and decreased worker productivity; in the long term, they may close altogether. This trend, Ponticelli finds, appears to drive greater concentration in the sector, as workers from smaller firms are absorbed by larger ones.\n\u201cThe goal should be to increase value, not just lower prices.\u201d\n\u2014 Associate professor of strategy \nAmanda Starc\n, in \nKellogg Insight\n, on why Medicare negotiations with drug makers may not be a cure-all.\nSee you next week!\nSusie Allen, senior research editor\nKellogg Insight\n\u00a0 \nYou should follow us on \nTwitter\n or \nLinkedIn\n.\nAnd listen to our \npodcasts\n.\nFeedback\n \u00a0\u00b7\u00a0 \nUnsubscribe\n \u00a0\u00b7\u00a0 \nAbout Us\n\u00a9 Kellogg School of Management, Northwestern University.",

    "body": "The most life-changing action in strategic TA\u2026 is to ask your CEO to become your Chief Recruiter.\n \n \nShare\n \n \nShare\n \n \nTweet\n \nLATEST ARTICLE\n \nWhy Isn\u2019t Your CEO\u2026 Also, Your Chief Recruiter?\n(Because The Changes Will Be Startling)\nThe most life-changing action in strategic TA\u2026 is to ask your CEO to become your Chief Recruiter. Yes, the results from this single bold strategic action will literally take your breath away. Your CEO as your Chief Recruiter (CR) may, just by itself, bring your recruiting department the recognition, support, cooperation, and resources that its leaders have historically only dreamed about having.\nThe remainder of this article covers a description of this CR approach, the many benefits that the organization will receive, and some initial implementation steps.\nA Brief Description Of The \u201cChief Recruiter\u201d Approach\nWhen your CEO becomes your organization\u2019s Chief Recruiter (CR), they accept the responsibility and the accountability for dramatically improving recruiting results. Many CEOs accepted a similar champion role years ago when they realized the importance of supply chain management. And this CR approach is actually quite common in fast-growing startups.\nThis \u201cchampion role\u201d begins with the CEO making it clear to every employee and manager. Improving recruiting results is now so strategically critical that they must accept a greater role in bumping up those results. To your CEO, this added role also involves adding the importance of recruiting to most of their existing internal and external communications.\nIn most cases, the Chief Recruiter (CR) also states that it is their expectation that every employee becomes a 24/7 talent hawk. And in that role, everyone not only seeks out exceptional talent. But they also spread the word externally about why your organization is a top place to work (this information is generally spread when the employee is seeking referrals).\nFinally, the CR accepts responsibility for identifying and ensuring all major recruiting roadblocks are fixed. Many in recruiting leadership will be surprised at how the power and influence of the CEO\u2019s office will, by itself, create a night-and-day difference in your recruiting landscape.\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2013\nImagine The Night And Day Differences That Having A Chief Recruiter Will Create\nThe power and influence that your CEO will bring can literally minimize every \u201cdifficult\u201d aspect of recruiting almost overnight. Think about it.\nSuddenly, there is an abundance of resources\n\u00a0\u2013 with the CEO as your Chief Recruiter and champion. Recruiting will finally be able to obtain the needed extra budget and resources that HR could never find for it.\nManagers will now find abundant time for recruiting\n\u00a0\u2013 once individual managers realize that their CEO has, for the first time, put every aspect of recruiting under a microscope. The hiring managers who could never find the time to recruit will now enthusiastically find the time.\nGetting on executive agendas will be easy\n\u00a0\u2013 with the CEO as your champion. The recruiting function will now easily get new ideas on executive and manager agendas that previously were completely off-limits to recruiting.\nGaining cooperation will now be automatic\u00a0\n\u2013 the cooperation and the coordination that TA could never get from \u201cinternal silos\u201d and political managers. With the CEO\u2019s influence, this cooperation will now become automatic.\nExecutives will pay attention to your recruiting metrics\u00a0\n\u2013 the recruiting metrics that HR would never allow you to send to the CEO or the executive committee. Will now be seen and scrutinized by them each month.\nYes, imagine a future where recruiting leaders won\u2019t have to fight for a seat at the table And where executives actually welcome new ideas on how to improve recruiting results dramatically. Taken together, you will realize that these dramatic before and after contrasts will only occur when you get your CEO to become your Chief Recruiter.\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\nOver the last dozen years, the CEOs of many top companies (including Amazon, Google, and\u00a0\nApple\n) have all publicly declared that \u201chiring is the most important thing we do.\u201d So it makes sense for a CEO to openly declare that they are the Chief Recruiter.\nArguments For Convincing Your CEO To Become Your Chief Recruiter\nBefore anyone approaches their CEO about the possibility of them taking a direct leadership role in recruiting, you had better prepare to start the conversation with more than a handful of convincing pre-tested arguments. Those arguments should cover your business case and why it\u2019s critical to the organization that the CEO accepts this added role. The top 10 arguments that you should consider presenting to your CEO include:\nWhen you need a high-impact, low-cost strategic recruiting solution, this may be it\n\u00a0\u2013 if you\u2019re frustrated because every new recruiting approach that you have tried hasn\u2019t really had a significant impact on your results. You should consider this \u201ctop-down\u201d corporate-wide approach where you create a recruiting culture that permeates the entire organization. And that is led by the most powerful person in your organization, your CEO. So that your CEO openly becomes the primary champion and the chief advocate for excellent recruiting.\nThis shift will provide your organization with a competitive advantage\u00a0\n\u2013\n\u00a0\nsince I first\u00a0\nrecommended this CR approach back in 2003\n. I have noted that this shift will not only increase your hiring volume by as much as 20%. But that will also result in new hires who will perform measurably better on the job (than those hired before the shift). And, of course, using this unique \u201ctop-down\u201d approach could also give your organization a competitive recruiting advantage in your industry.\nThe strategic importance of recruiting will be understood by all\u00a0\n\u2013\n\u00a0\nbecause it is somewhat unusual for the CEO to be the chief recruiter. Having such a powerful person in that role will ensure that everyone (both inside and outside) is aware that great recruiting is a top-priority corporate strategic goal.\nCEO recruiting messages will be noticed\n\u00a0\u2013 because of their title and wide visibility. Almost everything that this CR says about recruiting will be noticed both inside and outside of your organization. Being noticed increases the likelihood that your target audience will see, listen to, or read their recruiting messages.\nTheir recruiting messages will be believed\n\u00a0\nand then acted on\n\u00a0\u2013 once potential applicants hear/see a CEO\u2019s recruiting message. Their status and the fact that CEOs speak for the entire organization. Your targeted applicants will be much more likely to believe the content of each of their messages. And that believability will increase the chances that your target will apply. Note that your CEO\u2019s believability rating may be twice as high as the rating of your recruiters and hiring managers.\nNo other executive can be as effective in the CR role\n\u00a0\u2013 given their visibility, status, power, and the assumption that they speak for the entire organization. No other executive, VP, or director could even approach the impact that the CEO would have. And just like in college basketball, it is simply a fact that no one could have the same impact on recruiting success as the top decision-maker.\nMost CEOs already have the required skills\n\u00a0\u2013 I have found that most CEOs can accept this role with confidence. Most are already highly skilled in the essential role elements of attracting, nudging/influencing, and selling. So they won\u2019t need to undergo extensive training. You can find more about how CEOs can help to sell important candidates\u00a0\nhere\n.\nIf you\u2019re struggling to meet your diversity recruiting goals, having a CR may be the answer\n\u00a0\u2013 it\u2019s no secret that almost every organization is currently struggling to meet its diversity recruiting goals. Well, fortunately, it turns out that one of the best ways to convince potential diversity recruits to apply is when it is obvious to them that the CEO of this organization is not only concerned about diversity. But that he/she is willing to take both a strategic and a \u201chands-on role\u201d in ensuring that this goal is actually met.\nAs an added benefit, this shift will also improve your employer brand image\n\u00a0\u2013 if you are concerned about maintaining excellent recruiting results over the long term. You must realize that your CEO is actually an important part of your employer brand image. So, that image will be improved in future recruiting and be enhanced when they see that your CEO is concerned with employee issues. As part of your recruiting culture, your chief recruiter will also encourage every employee to accept the role of \u201ctalent hawk actively.\u201d Fortunately, this will add an army to your employer\u2019s brand-building effort as your employees actively spread positive stories about your organization to their friends and colleagues.\nThe costs of this added role will be limited to time\n\u00a0\u2013 this shift doesn\u2019t require any increase in out-of-pocket recruiting costs (other than the costs that may come from increased employee referral traffic). It also doesn\u2019t require any reorganization or new hiring. Obviously, your CEO will have to spend a significant amount of time recruiting related matters. But in many cases, top CEOs already spend a great deal of time on recruiting. One study revealed that most CEOs spend\u00a0\nbetween 30% \u2013 50% of their time on recruiting.\n\u00a0For example, Dave Gilboa (Warby Parker) says he has spent 25% of his time. And Mark Zuckerberg (Meta) noted that he has spent up to \u201c50% of his time recruiting talent.\u201d Tiago Paiva (Talkdesk) says that he has spent 80% of his time recruiting (at his startup).\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\nRecommended Action Steps\u2026 If You Choose To Implement This Process\nAfter you have convinced your CEO to become your organization\u2019s chief recruiting champion and advocate. They will, of course, want to know what initial action steps you recommend that they should take. There is, of course, no set \u201cimplementation playbook\u201d. But below, you will find many of the implementation actions that others have taken.\nMake sure that your Chief Recruiter is visible on your own platforms\u00a0\n\u2013 when potential recruits are searching through your organization\u2019s online sites. Make sure it\u2019s easy for them to find video, audio, or narrative messages from your CEO that cover the best aspects of working at your organization. You can find a great example of this vocal message practice by Greg Brown at Udemy\u00a0\nhere.\nMake your CR more visible on social media\n\u00a0\u2013 data-driven recruiting functions determine which social media platforms your high-value recruiting targets frequently. So it makes sense for your Chief Recruiter, as well as your employees, to concentrate on those platforms. To spread stories and examples about why your organization should be the recruiting target\u2019s next step. In most cases, this will mean having the CR appear in the videos that appear on your organization\u2019s YouTube channel.\nParticipate in Podcasts\u00a0\n\u2013 because the most prized candidates are continually learning. It makes sense for the Chief Recruiter to participate in the most popular industry podcasts actively. And when feasible, to offer their own company podcasts on the company website.\u00a0\nAlso, increase CR visibility in traditional media\n\u00a0\u2013 have your chief recruiter also set aside time to author articles and to participate in interviews with at least one major business and industry journal each month.\nIndustry event speaking\n\u00a0\u2013 have your CR give talks and present at industry and functional conferences. In that presentation, include at least one component covering your employee programs.\nCompany events\n\u00a0\u2013 have your CEO talk about how you treat people whenever your CEO is talking during your organization\u2019s routine business events (including PR appearances at product reveals and customer talks).\nOffer rewards for great people management\n\u00a0\u2013 the CEO can indirectly improve the managers that are involved in hiring. When they insist that HR has a process for formally measuring the effectiveness of each individual manager (Google has one), they then go a step further and ensure that each manager is significantly rewarded for great people management.\nAction steps for individual recruits and employees\nIn addition to the above broad steps, the Chief Recruiter can also play a role in recruiting top individual candidates.\nCalls to top recruits\n\u00a0\u2013 have the CR set aside a certain number of hours per month to call top prospects or candidates directly to build their excitement. And in special cases, to invite them in for a one-on-one visit.\nClose the deal calls\n\u00a0\u2013 after the offer has been made. And you want to increase your odds of acceptance. Have your CEO call the finalist in order to answer their strategic questions and encourage them to say yes.\nCome to my office on the first day\n\u00a0\u2013 another \u201creinforcing the deal\u201d action. Request the new hire to come to the CEO\u2019s office on the first day for a \u201creinforcing the sale\u201d visit. This action will further excite the new hire and show them they made a good decision. This action will improve retention, and it may lead the new hire to provide additional referrals.\nRetention calls/visits\n\u00a0\u2013 having the CEO periodically call key employees who might be at risk of leaving. It will help improve top employee retention. Based on the same premise, a personal call from the CEO will make a big positive impression.\nIf you only do one thing\u00a0\n\u2013\u00a0\nlook both internally and externally. For past examples of how other \u201cChief ________ Officers\u201d have been appointed to solve a major strategic business problem. And then use both the positive and the negative lessons from those experiences to sculpt your plan for getting the CEO to become your Chief Recruiter.\nFinal Thoughts\nIn my over four decades of research on recruiting best practices. I have literally never found a single strategic recruiting program that could even come close to equaling the almost instantaneous and startling impacts that occur. In the months immediately after, a CEO enthusiastically accepts the role of Chief Recruiter (the next most impactful approach is implementing a strong data-driven referral program). So I highly recommend that you seriously consider a plan for convincing your CEO to accept this important role.\nAuthor\u2019s Note\nPlease spread these ideas\n\u00a0by sharing this article with your team/network\n\u00a0and by posting it on your favorite media.\nAlso, join the well over 20,000\u2026 that follow or have connected with Dr. Sullivan\u2019s community on\u00a0\nLinkedIn\n.\nAnd, if you don\u2019t already subscribe to Dr. Sullivan\u2019s Aggressive Talent Management articles, you can do that\u00a0\nhere\n.\nMOST RECENT ARTICLES\nWhy Isn\u2019t Your CEO\u2026 Also, Your Chief Recruiter?

    "body": "Plus: Google's antitrust fight. \nYou\u2019re the boss! Now what? \u00a0\u00b7\u00a0 \nView in browser\n \nThe Insightful Leader\nBY \nKELLOGG INSIGHT\nLeadership advice from the Kellogg School of Management at Northwestern University\nGood morning,\nGetting promoted is great. But having to manage your former peers? Not always so fun.\nOver at \nThe Insightful Leader podcast\n, \nHarry Kraemer\n had some advice for how to navigate that sticky situation.\nIf you don\u2019t already know Kraemer, you\u2019re in for a treat: He was chairman and CEO of a multibillion-dollar healthcare company, Baxter International. He\u2019s on a lot of different boards; he\u2019s a favorite professor here at Kellogg, where he teaches management; and, most importantly, he is willing and able to answer any question that we at \nKellogg Insight\n ask about leading people.\nSo as part of our occasional \u201cAsk Insight\u201d podcast series, we peppered him with some listener questions, as well as a few of our own. You can listen to Part 1 of that episode \nhere\n; Part 2 is on its way. (Want to make sure you don\u2019t miss it? Subscribe! We\u2019re on \niTunes\n, \nSpotify\n, \nStitcher\n, and \nOvercast\n.)\nSet expectations, early and often\nOK, back to the quandary at hand. Kraemer says you don\u2019t necessarily have to end the personal relationship\u2014as long as you trust yourself to play both parts, friend and boss, fairly. Ultimately, it\u2019s a decision that requires self-reflection; he suggests asking yourself the question, \u201cDo I feel that I can explain to folks that now I\u2019m the boss and I\u2019m going to be holding them accountable?\u201d\nIf you do decide to maintain the friendship, Kraemer recommends setting expectations early. He\u2019s even got a little script to try: \u201cI\u2019ll say, \u2018we can still be friends, but I just want to remind you, I do have to now hold you accountable,\u2019\u201d he says. \u201cSo when I say, \u2018geez, this project, this is due at five o\u2019clock,\u2019 if in your mind, you say, \u2018well, it\u2019s Harry, we\u2019re friends. I can turn it in at 10,\u2019 that\u2019s going to be a problem.\u201d\n \nSetting clear expectations can prevent other common workplace challenges, too. For example, if you\u2019ve got an employee who seems to be taking advantage of your trust (say, running lots of errands on company time), the real problem may be that you, as a leader, didn\u2019t make the rules of the road explicit enough.\nSo when you learn that a team member has been grocery shopping on the clock, don\u2019t immediately assume their intentions were bad. Instead, you can start with a quick conversation about what kinds of schedule flexibility you\u2019re OK with\u2014and what kinds you aren\u2019t.\n\u201cI love to give people the benefit of the doubt,\u201d Kraemer explains. \u201cI\u2019m going to assume that I didn\u2019t make it clear. I\u2019m going to assume that maybe that wasn\u2019t obvious. \u2026 But now here\u2019s the key thing for me, after I\u2019ve now made it clear, after I\u2019ve set a clear expectation, after we\u2019ve communicated, if it happens again, then I\u2019m going to view this as a breakdown in trust. And as you well know, when you lose the trust, bad things happen.\u201d\nTo Kraemer, the best management emerges from a simple formula\u2014set expectations, communicate, and hold people accountable. When people understand what you want them to do, why you want them to do it, and the consequences of not following through, \u201cit solves so many problems, so much frustration that goes on in life.\u201d\nYou can listen to the whole episode and the rest of Kraemer\u2019s advice \nhere\n.\nGot any other burning leadership questions for Kellogg faculty? Send them our way at \ninsight@kellogg.northwestern.edu\n.\nTalking point\nThe Electoral College gets a lot of criticism, particularly for the disproportionate weighting of small and swing states. But in a new paper, Kellogg\u2019s \nGeorgy Egorov\n outlines one important and underdiscussed upside of the Electoral College: it reduces both the incentives to commit election fraud and the likelihood of pulling it off. That\u2019s because under this system, states where fraud would be the most useful (i.e., the swing states) are the same ones where it would be least feasible, in that they tend to have a stronger opposition party, making it more likely the fraud would be detected and punished.\nRead the \nwhole story\n.\n\u201cThe antitrust laws are clear on this.

    "body": "As a hiring guru, I guarantee that this interview question will instantly raise your hiring results.\n \n \nShare\n \n \nShare\n \n \nTweet\n \nLATEST ARTICLE\n \nInstantly Improve Hiring Results Using \u201cSolve This Problem\u201d Interview Questions\n(The most impactful interview question)\nAs a hiring guru, I guarantee that this interview question will instantly raise your hiring results. Yes, having a candidate answer a \u201csolve this problem\u201d interview question may be the most impactful interview question of all. This may seem too good to be true, but trust me on this one.\nI\u2019ve been helping managers at top corporations improve their hiring for over four decades. And, I have found that there is only one simple, \u201cno-brainer\u201d way to improve your hiring results instantly is to begin asking these \u201csolve this problem\u201d interview questions.\u00a0\nWhat Is A \u201cSolve This Problem\u201d Interview Question?\nThe best way to assess a candidate\u2019s ability to do your job is, of course, to physically put them into that job. Unfortunately, in almost all cases, this is simply not feasible for safety reasons.\nHowever, there is a way to at least partially put your candidate into the job during the interview process. And that can happen if you begin using \u201csolve this problem\u201d interview questions.\nThese questions involve verbally giving the candidate a real problem that is already occurring in the open job. And then ask the candidate to verbally \u201cwalk us through the steps\u201d that they would take to solve this problem.\u201d\nYour \u201csolve this problem\u201d interview questions can cover a variety of current problems, including improving output quality/speed, improving customer service, or first-month preparation steps for thoroughly learning about their new job, manager, and team.\nWhy Do\u201d Solve This Problem\u201d Questions Predict So Well?\nThere are numerous reasons why \u201csolve this problem\u201d questions yield so much valuable information. Which fortunately results in the making of significantly better hiring decisions. Those reasons include:\nStandard interview questions don\u2019t work\n\u00a0\u2013 because the interview is the final determinant of which candidates will be considered for hiring. It is critical that you get the interview right. Begin by realizing that most traditional interviews have multiple flaws. And because of these many flaws, research by Google has revealed that\u00a0\nstandard interviews don\u2019t predict any better than a coin flip\n. The largest interview problem area is the fact that 95% of traditional interview questions don\u2019t reveal whether the candidate can actually do this specific job. In addition, well-prepared interviewees can answer most of these standard questions effectively, without any real knowledge about how to do this job.\u00a0\nPutting the candidate in the job is the best predictor of on-the-job success\n\u00a0\u2013 any assessment that puts the candidate \u201cin or close to the job\u201d will be the best predictor (the EEOC calls it job content validity). And since a great deal of a new hire\u2019s success comes from their ability to solve problems. Having the candidate solve current problems will give you great predictive insight into their likelihood of successfully completing work tasks.\u00a0\nSolving an existing problem is superior to solving a past problem at another company\u00a0\n\u2013 all behavioral interview questions ask the candidate how they solved a similar problem in the past at another company. However, you need to know precisely how each candidate would solve your current problems in a way that fits your culture. So, in addition to any interview questions that you are fond of. You must also ask each candidate how they would solve at least one of the job\u2019s current problems within the values and culture of your organization.\nOnly asking them to \u201cwalk you through the steps\u201d saves interview time\n\u00a0\u2013 asking a candidate to explain their complete solution to a problem would be extremely time-consuming. So, instead, I recommend only requesting a shortened version of their solution. Under this\u201d solve this problem\u201d process. You only ask the candidate to highlight each of the steps they would take and why each is important. Dramatically shortening the time that is required for them to provide their answer.\nAssessing their answers will be easy\n\u00a0\u2013 because each \u201csolve this problem\u201d question covers one of your team\u2019s existing problems. Each interviewer will be familiar with the required steps to resolve this problem. And they will quickly know when an important step has been omitted. The process will be further improved when each interviewer is given a score sheet that lists the elements of a complete answer (note: sample scoring sheets can be found later in this article).\nAnd as an added surprise, unlike most typical boring interview questions.\u00a0\nYou will be pleasantly surprised when you discover that your top candidates will actually be excited when they experience this type of question. And I guarantee that they will long remember that you were the only company that challenged them.\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\nExample #1\n\u00a0\u2013 A \u201cSolve This Problem\u201d Interview Question Covering\u2026 Customer Service Rep Cooperation\u00a0\nIf you need more details on how to sculpt a \u201csolve this problem\u201d interview question. Below, you will find a sample script that covers the process for asking this type of interview question to customer service candidates.\nThe interviewer verbally explains our \u201csolve this problem\u201d interview question process to the candidate.\nAn introduction by the head interviewer\u00a0\n\u2013 because problem-solving is such a critical success factor in this job. We need to see how you will solve one of our existing problems. One that you will likely face if you become one of our customer service reps. Please solve the problem in the context of what you currently know about our corporate and team values and culture.\nThe interviewer describes the problem\u00a0\n\u2013 Mary, our newly hired customer service rep, has struggled to perform during her first month. Primarily because she hasn\u2019t been getting much cooperation and support from our team\u2019s other experienced customer service reps, we would like you to\u2026\nPlease \u201cwalk us through the steps\u201d covering how you would go about identifying the root causes of this \u201clack of coworker support\u201d problem.\u00a0\nPlease list at least eight of your primary root cause identification steps in chronological order. When you cite each step, please briefly explain why it is necessary.\u00a0\nDo you have any questions about the problem, our expectations for your answer, or this process?\nA score sheet covering the elements of a complete root cause identification answer\nEach of the interviewers would, in advance, be given a score sheet that would prompt them on what we expect in a complete \u201croot cause identification answer.\u201d The assessment factors for this customer service rep question cover five positive factors and three knockout factors:\nPositive points should be awarded when:\nTheir solution includes at least eight primary steps\nTheir explanation of why each individual step is needed was crystal clear\u00a0\nOne of the initial steps included external benchmarking research\nOne step involved anticipating the fact that coworkers may not be forthcoming with information\nOne step covered the creation of suggested metrics for measuring inter-team cooperation\u00a0\nKnockout factors include\nOmitting at least once consulting with their manager\u00a0\nNot pretesting their proposed solution\u00a0\nNot sharing their information and final solution with others\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\nExample #2\n\u00a0\u2013 An Interview Question Covering\u2026 Elements Of An Effective Sales Team Lead Development Plan\nThe head interviewer would first verbally explain our \u201csolve this problem\u201d interview question process to the candidate\nAn introduction by the head interviewer\u00a0\n\u2013 because problem-solving is such a critical success factor in this job. We need to see how you will solve an existing problem that you will likely face if you become a sales team lead. Please solve the provided problem in the context of what you currently know about our corporate and team values and culture.\nThe interviewer describes the problem\u00a0\n\u2013 Mohammed, we have found that our newly hired sales leads initially struggle to produce results. They haven\u2019t developed a proactive plan for learning everything about their job, the team, and its customers during their first month. So we would like you to\u2026\nPlease \u201cwalk us through the steps\u201d (in chronological order) that you would take to determine the most important elements that must be in a successful proactive learning plan that would cover your first month on the job. And when you describe each step, please explain why each is necessary.\nDo you have any questions about the problem, our expectations for your answer, or this process?\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2013\nA score sheet covering the evaluation factors for identifying the content of a sales lead learning plan\nEach of the interviewers would be given a score sheet that would prompt them on the appropriate steps for determining the key content elements of a successful learning plan. The assessment points include six positive factors and three knockout factors:\nPositive points should be awarded when:\nTheir process for identifying the appropriate content for the learning plan included at least eight steps\nTheir explanation of why each identification step was necessary was crystal clear\u00a0\nOne of the initial steps for determining the appropriate content included external benchmarking research covering the best practices for new sales team leaders in our industry\nOne content identification step covered gathering data that revealed the critical success factors for new sales leaders\u00a0\nOne content identification step covered talking to the most and the least effective current and past sales leads within the company\nOne content intensification step involved researching how AI and technology could improve sales team effectiveness\u00a0\nKnockout factors would include\nNot asking to review the content of the initial learning plan that was used by the departing sales lead\nNot researching the importance of technology on the success of sales leads\u00a0\nNot including a step for sharing the finished learning plan with other internal sales leaders\u00a0\u00a0\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\nAdditional Content Areas That Might Be Covered In \u201cSolve This Problem\u201d Questions\nThis final section contains a few additional problem areas that have been effectively covered with \u201csolve this problem\u201d questions.\nOutline your plan for this job\n\u00a0\u2013 if you need an employee that plans ahead. Assess whether this candidate has already put together a plan covering what actions they will take during their first six months on this job. A complete answer will cover their goals, who they\u2019ll consult with (by title), what data they\u2019ll analyze, how they\u2019ll communicate with their team, and what success metrics they will use.\u00a0\nForecast the evolution of this job and industry\n\u00a0\u2013 having employees who can anticipate future shifts is critical in a fast-changing world. So, ask the candidate to forecast at least five ways this open job will likely evolve over the next three years as a result of significant shifts in the business and technology environment. The second part of the question should also ask the candidate to forecast major changes in your industry. When you use this question, realize that having the candidate get the future changes 100% correct may be less important than verifying that the candidate constantly thinks about and plans for the future.\nIdentify the potential weaknesses in our process\n\u00a0\n\u2013 if you need a new hire who is an expert at identifying potential weaknesses in existing processes. As part of their interview, hand the candidate a single-page diagram of one of your existing but flawed processes related to this open job. Give them a few minutes to examine the process. Then, ask them to identify the top three areas where they anticipate that serious problems are the most likely to occur to ensure accurate assessment. Prior to the interview, make up your own list of the actual pain points that you have previously identified in this process.\nHow will you determine what technology to purchase\u00a0\n\u2013 in jobs where acquiring new technology will be essential. Ask the candidate to \u201cwalk you through the steps\u201d of the process that they will use to discover, evaluate, and purchase new technology for their team. The best answers will include examining performance data, determining how often updates will be needed, and the economic viability of the vendor.\nFinal Thoughts\nIf you search the Internet for \u201cmy favorite interview questions,\u201d you will literally come up with hundreds of them. Unfortunately, I have found that 99% of these supposed gems are actually quite worthless.\nIn my research, the only \u201cmagic interview question\u201d that I have found to actually work is one that I have recommended and used for years. And that is the \u201cwalk me through the steps on how you would solve our problem\u201d interview question.\nIt works so well because it assesses the candidate\u2019s ability to solve a real current problem in the context of your own company\u2019s culture. Hiring managers also find this approach to be extremely intuitive and easy to implement.\nIncidentally, if you want to learn more about the most powerful nontraditional interview questions, you can find my popular companion Harvard Business Review article on that subject\u00a0\nhere\n.\u00a0\nAuthor\u2019s Note\nPlease spread this tool\n\u00a0by sharing this article with your team/network\n\u00a0and by posting it on your favorite media.\u00a0And, if you don\u2019t already subscribe to Dr. Sullivan\u2019s Aggressive Talent Management articles, you can do that\u00a0\nhere\n.\nMOST RECENT ARTICLES\nInstantly Improve Hiring Results Using \u201cSolve This Problem\u201d Interview Questions (The most impactful interview question)\nRecruiting Ads In Podcasts \u2013 Hire The Most Impactful Candidates, Continuous Learners (The complete guide for recruiting in podcasts)\nRecruiting Must Accept Accountability\u2026 For Producing Great Hiring Results\nMost Don\u2019t Rate HR As Strategic \u2013 Here\u2019s Why (Outside the box actions for making HR strategic)\nRESOURCES\n \nStay Interviews and Other Powerful Retention Tools\nIn this brand new eBook, learn how to implement Stay Interviews, the highest ROI activity that any manager can utilize which\u00a0has been proven effective in keeping top performers.\nPURCHASE HERE\n \n \nOnboarding & Orientation Toolkit\nHave you been frustrated that it takes new hires/transfers longer than it should to get up-to-speed and become productive faster?

    "body": "Plus: why consulting firms are racing to develop AI expertise. \nWhat your portfolio says about you \u00a0\u00b7\u00a0 \nView in browser\n \nThe Insightful Leader\nBY \nKELLOGG INSIGHT\nLeadership advice from the Kellogg School of Management at Northwestern University\nGood morning,\nWhat\u2019s in your portfolio? Are you betting big on lots of high-risk, high-reward stocks, or are you mostly playing it safe with U.S. treasury bonds?\nHow you answer this question likely reveals something important about your personality, according to some interesting \nnew research\n by Kellogg associate professor of finance \nZhengyang Jiang\n. Jiang and his coauthors found that the \nBig Five personality traits\n\u2014agreeableness, conscientiousness, extroversion, openness, and neuroticism\u2014have a meaningful impact on our investment decisions.\nTwo traits in particular\u2014neuroticism and openness\u2014stand out for their role in shaping how investors play the stock market (or don\u2019t). Nervous Nellies, it turns out, steer clear of equities, while openness is correlated with more stock investing and lower risk aversion.\nThis week, in addition to exploring the intersection of personality and portfolio, we\u2019ll also explain why your next presentation may not benefit from a big reveal.\nThe power of personality\nJiang\u2019s research involved surveying the 150,000 members of the \nAmerican Association of Individual Investors (AAII)\n, a nonprofit organization that teaches individual investors how to successfully build investment wealth.\nThe study\u2019s key innovation was to combine questions about the process of investment decision-making with a 20-item questionnaire that aimed to determine each respondent\u2019s personality traits using the Big Five model. Another set of questions focused on equity allocation\u2014specifically, how much money each respondent had invested and what percentage was in stocks. The survey also sought to ascertain attitudes toward risk.\n \nAnalyzing the survey data, Jiang and his coauthors found that individuals with high openness and low neuroticism tended to invest more in equities\u2014including individual stocks and stock funds.\nMany of the connections the researchers identified are intuitive. The data showed, for example, that highly neurotic investors are much more concerned with downside risk. Investors with high conscientiousness and extroversion, by contrast, expect a lower probability of a market crash. And people scoring high on openness are more willing to entertain the possibility of either an upside or downside.\nSo take a look at your portfolio. What does it say about you? And with this in mind, is there anything you should be doing differently? You can read the whole article \nhere\n.\nNo surprises necessary\nNow, as promised, here\u2019s the big reveal about big reveals. You know the moment: that point in the presentation when you dramatically present your view of a business problem\u2014as well as the solution\u2014and wait for the praise to roll in.\nJoel Shapiro\n, a clinical associate professor of managerial economics and decision sciences at Kellogg, is not a fan.\n\u201c[B]ig reveals\u201d are a bad practice\u2014in danger of backfiring,\u201d Shapiro writes in \nHarvard Business Review\n. \u201cToo much surprise in a final presentation can put the audience on the defensive. The reason? Surprising results often prompt people to start questioning the underlying data and methods.\u201d\nShapiro is writing about data scientists in particular, but his advice seems relevant to anyone looking to solve a tough problem in a large organization.\nInstead of holing up in your office trying to find the solution on your own, he advises what he calls \u201cproblem-shepherding,\u201d where you provide regular (preliminary) updates to other interested parties, hashing out debates about how the data should be interpreted and analyzed in real time. He suggests asking questions like, \u201cAre these initial results of interest?\u201d and \u201cAre we defining terms correctly?\u201d\nYou can read more of his advice to aspiring data scientists \nhere\n.\n\u201cAI in general, and generative AI more particularly, is the shiny object that everybody\u2019s chasing. And when clients chase shiny objects, consultants chase clients.\u201d\n\u2014 \nMohanbir Sawhney\n, in \nBusiness Insider\n, on consulting firms\u2019 race to develop AI expertise.\nSee you next week!\nSusie Allen, senior research editor\nKellogg Insight\n\u00a0 \nYou should follow us on \nTwitter\n or \nLinkedIn\n.\nAnd listen to our \npodcasts\n.\nFeedback\n \u00a0\u00b7\u00a0 \nUnsubscribe\n \u00a0\u00b7\u00a0 \nAbout Us\n\u00a9 Kellogg School of Management, Northwestern University.",

    "body": "Learning ability is the #1 predictor of job success, and continuous learners listen to podcasts.\n \n \nShare\n \n \nShare\n \n \nTweet\n \nLATEST ARTICLE\n \nRecruiting Ads In Podcasts \u2013 Hire The Most Impactful Candidates, Continuous Learners\n(The complete guide for recruiting in podcasts)\nLearning ability is the #1 predictor of job success, and continuous learners listen to podcasts. Yes, Google, the world\u2019s only data-driven recruiting machine,\u00a0\nuses this learning ability criteria for every job\n.\nThese hires are so impactful because continuous learners not only bring a great deal of knowledge to the job. However, sharing that learning also helps their team grow, and learning leads directly to innovation, the most valuable employee behavior. These podcast recruitment ads excel because they allow you to get the attention of employed continuous learners when they are not expecting a recruiting pitch.\nThis tool also adds a competitive advantage because most organizations have never heard of it. I have found that once you find out about the many benefits of this mostly hidden recruiting tool, you\u2019ll wonder out loud why you haven\u2019t tried it.\nPart I \u2013 The Multitude Of Benefits That Come From Recruiting On Podcasts\nWe all know that the very best recruiters listen to podcasts in order to learn about emerging recruiting practices. However, few recruiters seem to realize that listening to functional podcasts is also a common practice among the very best recruiting targets. So, suppose you\u2019re looking to add a powerful recruiting tool to your mix. In that case, the first step for smart recruiters is to educate yourself about the many significant benefits that accrue to recruiting functions that use this amazing podcast source. Incidentally, the most impactful ones are listed first in the following list of benefits.\nTop seven benefits \u2013 covering the audience that they attract and their effectiveness at selling\u00a0\nPodcasts are an ideal passive candidate source\u00a0\n\u2013 this recruiting tool reaches the so-called passive candidate (a.k.a. non-job seeking employed professionals). Recruiting using a \u201cpassive source\u201d is highly desirable. Often, 80% % of the recruiting sources are used by recruiting functions or only designed to attract the less desirable active job seekers, and for those that don\u2019t know why, these \u201cnot actively looking employed candidates\u201d are the ideal recruiting targets. These targets are often superior because their experience and training are up-to-date. And during this time of frequent layoffs, their current organization has determined they are \u201ckeepers.\u201d\u00a0\nContinuous learners are the ideal recruiting target\n\u00a0\u2013 corporations like Google, Netflix, and Apple have found that these continuous learners become the most effective new hires. First, by regularly learning from podcasts, they are continually trying to improve. Next, they become great employees because they are voluntarily listening. Which makes them \u201cself-directed learners\u201d (this is important when corporate L&D budgets are low). Finally, their listening doesn\u2019t take away from their work hours because many listen to podcasts outside the normal 9 to 5 hours.\u00a0\nPodcasts reach a large, sophisticated audience that includes early adopters\u00a0\n\u2013 Podcast research reveals that 38% of US adults listen to podcasts at least once a month. And the average podcast listener is a sophisticated target because\u00a0\npodcast listeners are more likely to have\n\u00a0a college degree and a $100k+ income. And if you care about innovation, you will be happy to learn that podcast listeners are also \u201cearly adopters,\u201d which is a critical candidate trait if your organization needs to remain on the leading edge.\nPodcasts attract busy professionals\u00a0\n\u2013 podcasts attract busy professionals. Who are often the most desirable candidates. These recruiting targets are busy because their leaders assign them the most important work. Unfortunately, their heavy workload generally precludes them from \u201cnormal\u201d learning (i.e., attending seminars, reading books, or watching a scheduled webinar. However, because podcasts are relatively short, there are multiple times that they can fit into a busy person\u2019s schedule before, during, and after work. And because they are completely vocal. They don\u2019t require 100% attention, so that they can be listened to at lunch, during commutes, and physical workouts. This means that podcasts are often the only regularly available learning source for busy professionals.\u00a0\nYour podcast audience will precisely fit your open job\u00a0\n\u2013 obviously, your recruitment ads will have the highest impact. If they are placed in podcasts that cover the same advanced knowledge, problems, and skills needed to succeed in your open job. That means that the first selection criteria for a podcast should be that it targets either your industry or the job function of your open job. Fortunately, most podcast owners can tell you whatever you need to know about the characteristics and the demographics of the audience for each of their podcasts. You should also consider advertising on the podcasts frequently listened to by your employees currently working in your target job. Matching the podcast subject coverage area with your open job will ensure that your recruitment advertising dollars aren\u2019t wasted on listeners you don\u2019t care about.\nPodcast ads may help you improve your diversity recruiting\u00a0\n\u2013 podcasts can be especially effective for attracting diverse candidates. You can reach that goal if your podcast ads highlight your emphasis and successes in diversity recruiting. Also, be sure to include the company/job factors and \u201ckeywords/phrases\u201d that have been proven to attract diverse candidates. If you create your own podcasts, offering them in other popular languages may also improve your diversity results.\u00a0\nPodcast ads are effective at selling\n\u00a0\u2013 broad research on podcasts has shown that they are effective at selling. At least in the consumer space,\u00a0\nresearch has shown that\n\u00a0\u201c61% of podcast listeners have bought something after hearing a podcast ad.\u201d Where, unfortunately, in direct contrast,\u00a0\nonly 3% of job ad viewers actually apply\n. Unfortunately, no public data shows how effective recruiting ads in podcasts can be.\u00a0\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\nAdditional benefits that recruiting leaders will care about\nPodcast ads are easy to create\n\u00a0\u2013 because your podcast ads will be brief and 100% vocal. Developing them won\u2019t require technical skills or much manager or recruiter time. And their ease of development will mean that they can be changed or updated frequently without much effort.\nPodcast recruiting is inexpensive\n\u00a0\u2013 podcast ads are relatively cheap compared to recruitment advertising. You should know that with today\u2019s proliferation of podcasts. Not only do owners welcome ads, but their ad prices are likely to be quite reasonable. You should know that the cost of an individual ad will vary depending on the podcast\u2019s popularity. And whether the ad is placed at the podcast\u2019s beginning, middle, or end.\u00a0\nYour podcast ads will face little recruiting competition\u00a0\n\u2013 of course, placing product ads within podcasts isn\u2019t new. However, placing recruiting ads in them \u201c\nhasn\u2019t caught on as much in the field of recruitment\n.\u201d As a result, a simple Google search on this recruiting practice will reveal that very little has been written about the emerging practice of placing recruiting ads in podcasts. This means that your podcast ads will face less competition from other recruitment ads. And the competition will be negligible compared to the ad competition you face on traditional job posting sites. You should also know that to maintain the continuous attention of listeners, there may be only three ads in an entire podcast. And that means that there will be an excellent chance that your recruiting ad will be the only ad covering career opportunities. Incidentally, if you choose to sponsor the entire podcast, you will literally have no ad competition.\nThis innovative practice may help build your external employer brand image \u2013\u00a0\nbecause podcast recruiting is new and innovative and utilizes modern technology. Your use of this practice will likely be discussed among potential recruits (especially new generations). So, this positive talk may boost your overall external brand image and future recruiting.\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\nPart II \u2013 Action Steps For Increasing The Impact Of Your Podcast Ads\nIf you decide to conduct a trial of this innovative approach. Below, you will find several tips that will help you produce positive results immediately.\nThe most effective ads don\u2019t come across as recruiting ads\n\u00a0\u2013 because podcast listeners are generally not job seekers, they may not expect or even welcome a recruiting ad. So when your ad begins, avoid all talk about recruiting and open jobs. Instead, consider talking about your organization and the impressive things you are doing in the subject area covered by the podcast. Only toward the end should the ad subtly mention recruiting and how to apply. And if you place multiple ads during the podcast, the first one should be exclusively about the company.\nRecruitment ads should be tailored to the podcast\u2019s subject matter\u00a0\n\u2013 running the same ad in every podcast is a huge mistake. The most effective recruiting ads are those whose content closely matches a podcast\u2019s subject. So, whenever possible, the content of your ad should continually refer to the subject matter. For example, in a podcast that covers the emerging uses for AI. Your recruitment ad could mention that your corporation is doing excellent work and growing in all areas of AI. Obviously, if you mention specific job openings in the ad, those openings should always be in the same subject area. Incidentally, when the hiring manager is a participant during the entire podcast or when they mention who they are during the vocalization of the ad itself. You increase the chances that your ad will be listened to and remembered.\u00a0\nUse data to select which podcasts to advertise on\u00a0\n\u2013 rather than using your intuition or trial and error. In order to ensure success, you must use data to make your initial choice of podcasts. I recommend you survey a handful of your employees working in the area where you have open jobs. Identify which podcasts they listen to and what \u201cattraction words\u201d in the ad would excite them. Right before their job interviews, you can also ask the same questions to current candidates for your open jobs. And obviously, to continually improve, the leader of the effort must also develop success metrics.\u00a0\nUse texting to link listeners to your recruiting site\n\u00a0\u2013 unless the podcast has a visual component. The best way to quickly get listeners to apply is during or immediately after the podcast. Give them a text number that will instantly respond and connect them to that application site.\nPretest your ads \u2013\u00a0\nto limit embarrassment and increase your ads\u2019 attractiveness. Each one should be pretested with a focus group.\nSolicit the help of others\n\u00a0\u2013 if your organization\u2019s advertising department places ads in podcasts. You can shorten your learning curve by reaching out to them. It also makes sense to work with the podcast presenter to ensure that the podcast covers subject matter areas where your organization excels.\nConsider creating and presenting your own podcasts\n\u00a0\u2013 you can supplement your recruiting on established podcasts by offering your own podcasts. If you do, the fact that the participants will be real employees from your corporation will make both the podcast and the ads more attractive. And with total control over podcast content, you can ensure that your organization\u2019s best practices in the subject area come across effectively. Incidentally, in some cases, you should also consider posting a video version of the same podcast on YouTube. Or short clips from the podcast on TikTok or Instagram Reels.\u00a0\nIf you only do one thing\u00a0\n\u2013 ask every new hire in a high-volume hiring job family during onboarding to give you the name of their most listened-to podcast. And then place at least two recruiting ads in one edition of that most favored podcast. Within each ad, ask any listeners who decide to apply to mention a specific job code in their application (i.e., pcast). If you get even one \u201cpcast\u201d response, consider your podcast recruiting trial effort to be a success.\u00a0\nFinal Thoughts\nI\u2019ve been writing about the importance of employee learning for almost a decade (you can learn more about that broader topic\u00a0\nhere\n). Because in our fast-changing world, continuous self-directed learning may literally be the most important employee capability that you should be recruiting for. So if your organization requires learning and knowledge and a jumpstart in innovation, I can\u2019t recommend a more appropriate recruiting source than placing recruiting ads within podcasts covering the relevant technical topics for your open jobs. And do it quickly before others learn about this hidden but powerful recruiting tool.\nAuthor\u2019s Note\n\u00a0\nPlease spread these ideas\n\u00a0by sharing this article with your team/network\n\u00a0and by posting it on your favorite media.\nAnd, if you don\u2019t already subscribe to Dr. Sullivan\u2019s Aggressive Talent Management articles, you can do that\u00a0\nhere\n.\nMOST RECENT ARTICLES\nRecruiting Ads In Podcasts \u2013 Hire The Most Impactful Candidates, Continuous Learners (The complete guide for recruiting in podcasts)\nRecruiting Must Accept Accountability\u2026 For Producing Great Hiring Results\nMost Don\u2019t Rate HR As Strategic \u2013 Here\u2019s Why (Outside the box actions for making HR strategic)\nNew-Hire Announcements \u2013 The Subtle Recruiting Tool That Gets Everyone Talking\nRESOURCES\n \nStay Interviews and Other Powerful Retention Tools\nIn this brand new eBook, learn how to implement Stay Interviews, the highest ROI activity that any manager can utilize which\u00a0has been proven effective in keeping top performers.\nPURCHASE HERE\n \n \nOnboarding & Orientation Toolkit\nHave you been frustrated that it takes new hires/transfers longer than it should to get up-to-speed and become productive faster?

The majority of meetings spend too much time rehashing the past\u2014which immediately puts teams in a defensive posture\u2014and not enough time looking ahead to the future.\nKhosla makes the case that aiming for a 70/30 split between agenda items focused on the future versus the past makes for a more productive, engaging, and motivating experience. But how to get started? We\u2019ll dive into some of his advice this week.\nDitch the slides\nTo keep meetings efficient, Khosla offers a hard-and-fast rule about slide presentations: ban them.\n\u201cWe don\u2019t need them,\u201d he says. \u201cThey minimize conversation and tend to waste too much time on topics that could have been reviewed beforehand. Banning slides sends a very clear message that just sharing information is a waste of time.\u201d\nIn their place, Khosla recommends assigning pre-work for every participant. This is not a data dump for team members to sift through or a PowerPoint presentation in disguise. Instead, participants should send their colleagues crisp, synthesized pre-reading a few days in advance. \nThe reading materials should include scorecards, with clear metrics that show the progress that\u2019s been made on various projects since the last meeting, along with commentary about what\u2019s working and what needs adjustment. In the process of compiling their pre-reading materials, each team member is required to identify and be prepared to discuss specific areas in which they need help.\n \nThe packet\u2019s simple templates remain relatively consistent over time. This simplicity limits the amount of time that is spent in preparing and pre-reading.\n\u201cDoing this advance work makes it very clear what we\u2019re going to achieve and what success looks like in this meeting,\u201d Khosla says.\nFind a \u201cconscience\u201d\nTo keep everyone on the same page\u2014and keep conversations from drifting off track\u2014Khosla also recommends that leaders identify one individual to be the \u201cconscience\u201d at each meeting.\nThis person has several responsibilities: to make sure the pre-reading is delivered clearly and on time, to make sure the meeting maintains its 70/30 focus on the future, and to reserve time at the end of the meeting for leaders to make sure that each person understands expectations and accountability. This, of course, includes the leaders themselves, who will need to address any bottlenecks or resource gaps before their teams can proceed.\nHaving a \u201cconscience\u201d will help teams avoid having discussions derailed by \u201cshiny bright objects,\u201d Khosla says. For example, a team member may be asking for help with a marketing problem. A colleague might respond with a suggestion to try ChatGPT for ideas, which then devolves into a group tangent about the pros and cons of generative AI.\n\u201cIf you don\u2019t have a \u2018conscience,\u2019 it\u2019s easy to get distracted,\u201d Khosla says.\nAn added bonus? The \u201cconscience\u201d role is a great development tool for aspiring leaders looking to prove their mettle.\nYou can read more of Khosla\u2019s meeting tips\u2014like how to stay forward-focused while not glossing over past problems\u2014\nhere\n.\n\u201cIt\u2019s called a \npivot penalty\n. ... It means these people want to continue to push the frontier.\u201d\n\u2014 \nDashun Wang\n in \nThe New York Times\n on why scientists may see a temporary drop in productivity after winning a major award as they decide to move into new areas.\nSee you next week!\nJess Love, editor in chief\nKellogg Insight\n\u00a0 \nYou should follow us on \nTwitter\n or \nLinkedIn\n.\nAnd listen to our \npodcasts\n.\nFeedback\n \u00a0\u00b7\u00a0 \nUnsubscribe\n \u00a0\u00b7\u00a0 \nAbout Us\n\u00a9 Kellogg School of Management, Northwestern University.",
