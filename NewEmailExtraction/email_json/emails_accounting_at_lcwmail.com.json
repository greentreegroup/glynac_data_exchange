I will not be available for any meetings.\nI\u2019ll be back home and working on Monday the 28\nth\n, and will prioritize the EOM PPF first, then catching up on email.\n\u00a0\nHope the rest of the week goes great!\n\u00a0\n\u201cSG\u201d Gluckstein\n \n(they/them)\nAccountant\nLCW\nEmail: \naccounting@lcwmail.com\n\u00a0\nI will be traveling April 9\nth\n through 25\nth\n with limited access to email.\nWebsite\n\u00a0\n|\n\u00a0\nTwitter\n \n|\n\u00a0\nFacebook\n\u00a0\n|\n\u00a0\nLinkedIn\nView our upcoming events\n \n| \nSign-up for our newsletter",

When you get a sec, can you please lmk if the below is still appropriate? I'm updating our Translation Agreement & think the below might be out of date. Thank you!\n\u00a0\n6.5. \u00a0LCW shall pay the Translator with a check drawn on a US bank (or with PayPal, if so requested by the translator) in US dollars (US$), within 30 days of receiving the invoice, unless agreed upon otherwise by both LCW and the Translator. All bank and processing fees for receiving the money are the responsibility of the translator.\n\u00a0\n6.6. \u00a0The Translator \nmay \nrequest payment via electronic funds transfer (wire transfer). In cases where the invoice amount exceeds US$1000.00, LCW will pay the outgoing wire transfer fees. For lesser amounts, the wire transfer may be requested by discounting the invoice by US$35.00 for international transfers and US$25 for domestic (US) transfers (the charge LCW incurs by initiating the wire transfer).\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\nNicole Barile\n\u00a0\n(She/Her)\nChief Operating Officer\nLCW\n\u00a0\nWebsite\n\u00a0\n|\n\u00a0\nTwitter\n\u00a0\n|\n\u00a0\nFacebook\n\u00a0\n|\n\u00a0\nLinkedIn\nView our upcoming events\n\u00a0| \nSign-up for our newsletter",

In cases where the invoice amount exceeds US$1000.00, LCW will pay the outgoing wire transfer fees. For lesser amounts, the wire transfer may be requested by discounting the invoice by US$35.00 for international transfers and US$25 for domestic (US) transfers (the charge LCW incurs by initiating the wire transfer).\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\nNicole Barile\n\u00a0\n(She/Her)\nChief Operating Officer\nLCW\n\u00a0\nWebsite\n\u00a0\n|\n\u00a0\nTwitter\n\u00a0\n|\n\u00a0\nFacebook\n\u00a0\n|\n\u00a0\nLinkedIn\nView our upcoming events\n\u00a0| \nSign-up for our newsletter",

When you get a sec, can you please lmk if the below is still appropriate? I'm updating our Translation Agreement & think the below might be out of date. Thank you!\n\u00a0\n6.5. \u00a0LCW shall pay the Translator with a check drawn on a US bank (or with PayPal, if so requested by the translator) in US dollars (US$), within 30 days of receiving the invoice, unless agreed upon otherwise by both LCW and the Translator. All bank and processing fees for receiving the money are the responsibility of the translator.\n\u00a0\n6.6. \u00a0The Translator \nmay \nrequest payment via electronic funds transfer (wire transfer). In cases where the invoice amount exceeds US$1000.00, LCW will pay the outgoing wire transfer fees. For lesser amounts, the wire transfer may be requested by discounting the invoice by US$35.00 for international transfers and US$25 for domestic (US) transfers (the charge LCW incurs by initiating the wire transfer).\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\nNicole Barile\n\u00a0\n(She/Her)\nChief Operating Officer\nLCW\n\u00a0\nWebsite\n\u00a0\n|\n\u00a0\nTwitter\n\u00a0\n|\n\u00a0\nFacebook\n\u00a0\n|\n\u00a0\nLinkedIn\nView our upcoming events\n\u00a0| \nSign-up for our newsletter",

Since they prepaid half, what I will do is send invoices after the sessions are delivered for half of the total amount, rather than using up the prepayment and then sending full invoices \u2013 spread out the cash flow over the delivery.

Since they prepaid half, what I will do is send invoices after the sessions are delivered for half of the total amount, rather than using up the prepayment and then sending full invoices \u2013 spread out the cash flow over the delivery. Does that make sense? If they push back we can change that process but it\u2019s better for us to be sending milestone invoices along the way.\n\u00a0\nI can send Shani a draft invoice for the 3/10 EMEA session (for $4,500) for approval, and then do the same at the end of next month for the next session.

Since they prepaid half, what I will do is send invoices after the sessions are delivered for half of the total amount, rather than using up the prepayment and then sending full invoices \u2013 spread out the cash flow over the delivery.

If they push back we can change that process but it\u2019s better for us to be sending milestone invoices along the way.\n\u00a0\nI can send Shani a draft invoice for the 3/10 EMEA session (for $4,500) for approval, and then do the same at the end of next month for the next session.

We will need to add money (at least $12,000) before 4/5, when I expect the big 401k draft to go out (assuming the scheduling works the way I think it does on their end). It might be good to move that sooner in case it happens differently for the off-cycle run, and if it doesn\u2019t hit that day I\u2019ll keep my eyes open to be sure we have enough to cover it when it comes.

Since they prepaid half, what I will do is send invoices after the sessions are delivered for half of the total amount, rather than using up the prepayment and then sending full invoices \u2013 spread out the cash flow over the delivery. Does that make sense? If they push back we can change that process but it\u2019s better for us to be sending milestone invoices along the way.\n\u00a0\nI can send Shani a draft invoice for the 3/10 EMEA session (for $4,500) for approval, and then do the same at the end of next month for the next session. Let me know if that sounds good.\n\u00a0\nColgate: the item on my list is actually SOW 2025107, which is in sig pending status. Please let me know any updates on that.\n\u00a0\n(Colgate 2024175 is fully billed until their subscription charges come up again.)\n\u00a0\nThank you!!\nSG\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\nFrom:\n Rebecca Parrilla <\nr.parrilla@lcwmail.com\n> \nSent:\n Tuesday, March 25, 2025 09:31\nTo:\n Accounting <\naccounting@lcwmail.com\n>\nCc:\n Nicole Barile <\nn.barile@lcwmail.com\n>\nSubject:\n BSC & Colgate\n\u00a0\nHi there, good morning.

If they push back we can change that process but it\u2019s better for us to be sending milestone invoices along the way.\n\u00a0\nI can send Shani a draft invoice for the 3/10 EMEA session (for $4,500) for approval, and then do the same at the end of next month for the next session.

However, the invoice also needs to be fully filled out \u2013 Diligent has a long list of people who need to be on the email which needs to be in the invoice (see previous ones) and the \u201cPO needed\u201d field needs to be filled out. If I get an invoice that\u2019s missing info, I\u2019ll reset the status to \u201cawaiting PO\u201d and send an email that it needs fixing (which is this email right now). Once you add that information you can set it as \u201cready to invoice\u201d again.\n\u00a0\nBTW, per Alisa I\u2019m not sending new invoices right now, but anything that\u2019s ready will wait in my to-do bucket until I get the OK to resume.\n\u00a0\nSG\n\u00a0\nFrom:\n Nicole Barile <\nn.barile@lcwmail.com\n> \nSent:\n Wednesday, March 19, 2025 11:00\nTo:\n Accounting <\naccounting@lcwmail.com\n>\nCc:\n Cecilia Mariotta <\nc.mariotta@lcwmail.com\n>\nSubject:\n Translation invoice ready\n\u00a0\nHi SG,\nI'm helping Cecilia out & don't fully understand the GLS (global lang services) invoicing process.\n\u00a0\nThis quote just completed: \nhttps://lcw.scoro.com/quotes/view/1569\n\u00a0\nI created this invoice in Scoro (not sure if I did it right): \nhttps://lcw.scoro.com/invoices/view/1524\n\u00a0\nDo I need to email you to notify you that something is completed for GLS, or is creating the invoice enough (when I mark it \"ready to invoice\")?\n\u00a0\nThanks!\n\u00a0\nNicole Barile\n\u00a0\n(She/Her)\nChief Operating Officer\nLCW\n\u00a0\nWebsite\n\u00a0\n|\n\u00a0\nTwitter\n\u00a0\n|\n\u00a0\nFacebook\n\u00a0\n|\n\u00a0\nLinkedIn\nView our upcoming events\n\u00a0| \nSign-up for our newsletter",

If I get an invoice that\u2019s missing info, I\u2019ll reset the status to \u201cawaiting PO\u201d and send an email that it needs fixing (which is this email right now). Once you add that information you can set it as \u201cready to invoice\u201d again.\n\u00a0\nBTW, per Alisa I\u2019m not sending new invoices right now, but anything that\u2019s ready will wait in my to-do bucket until I get the OK to resume.\n\u00a0\nSG\n\u00a0\nFrom:\n Nicole Barile <\nn.barile@lcwmail.com\n> \nSent:\n Wednesday, March 19, 2025 11:00\nTo:\n Accounting <\naccounting@lcwmail.com\n>\nCc:\n Cecilia Mariotta <\nc.mariotta@lcwmail.com\n>\nSubject:\n Translation invoice ready\n\u00a0\nHi SG,\nI'm helping Cecilia out & don't fully understand the GLS (global lang services) invoicing process.\n\u00a0\nThis quote just completed: \nhttps://lcw.scoro.com/quotes/view/1569\n\u00a0\nI created this invoice in Scoro (not sure if I did it right): \nhttps://lcw.scoro.com/invoices/view/1524\n\u00a0\nDo I need to email you to notify you that something is completed for GLS, or is creating the invoice enough (when I mark it \"ready to invoice\")?\n\u00a0\nThanks!\n\u00a0\nNicole Barile\n\u00a0\n(She/Her)\nChief Operating Officer\nLCW\n\u00a0\nWebsite\n\u00a0\n|\n\u00a0\nTwitter\n\u00a0\n|\n\u00a0\nFacebook\n\u00a0\n|\n\u00a0\nLinkedIn\nView our upcoming events\n\u00a0| \nSign-up for our newsletter",

It is in your best interest to be prepared to present your case fully at the scheduled hearing, whether or not you filed the appeal. If you or your employer files an appeal, you will get a Notice of Hearing in the mail. The notice will tell you the date and time of your hearing, and explain how to participate. Most hearings are held by phone. \nPhone Hearings:\n You will receive a Notice of Phone Hearing in the mail approximately two weeks before your scheduled hearing. The hearing notice will instruct you to call the Appeal Tribunal to register for the hearing. \nYou must register in order to participate in the hearing\n. Your appeal may be dismissed or you may be denied participation in the hearing if you fail to register for the hearing. It is suggested that you call the Appeal Tribunal immediately upon receipt of this notice to register. When registering you will be asked to provide your name, docket number and telephone number where you can be reached for the hearing. You will be given a confirmation number when you register. Be sure to record the confirmation number on your hearing notice. The Appeals Examiner will call you on the day of the hearing when it is time to begin the hearing. You must accept this call; we will consider it failing to participate if we cannot reach you at the number you provide. \n\u2022 Caller ID shows the telephone numbers of the Appeal Tribunal as private, unknown, out-of-area, anonymous, etc. If your phone has other features or devices to block calls, those features should be turned off on the day of your scheduled hearing. \n\u2022 If you do not call us to initiate the hearing or do not answer our call to you, your appeal may be dismissed or decided unfavorably to you. You may have to pay back any benefits you have already received. \nIMPORTANT:\n If either you or the employer is appealing a decision about your eligibility, you should continue to certify for benefits during the appeal process. If the appeal is decided in your favor, you will receive unemployment benefits only for weeks you have certified for benefits. During the appeal process you must report to any appointments for which you are scheduled. If you do not keep these appointments, you may lose benefits, even if you win your appeal. \nIf your employer appeals your right to UI benefits \nIf your former employer(s) disagrees with the determination awarding you benefits, the employer may appeal. If it is determined that you are eligible for benefits, you will continue to receive your benefits as long as you meet all other requirements. If the Appeal Tribunal decides in the employer\u2019s favor, you will be required to repay all or part of the unemployment insurance benefits that have been paid to you. \nIf you cannot attend a scheduled hearing \nIf you are unable to participate in a scheduled hearing, you may request a postponement. The Appeal Tribunal may grant the request if you show good cause. If possible, request a postponement in advance of the hearing. \nAfter the hearing \nThe Appeal Tribunal\u2019s decisions are issued in writing and are based entirely on the evidence and testimony made at the hearing. If the Appeal Tribunal rules in your favor, the Division of Unemployment Insurance will issue any payments due. The Appeal Tribunal does not issue payments. Allow up to 7 days from the date of mailing for the unemployment insurance division to process the Appeal Tribunal\u2019s decision. \nPlease direct any questions about your appeal decision payment to the Reemployment Call Center. Call Centers are open weekdays (except state holidays) between 8:30 a.m. and 4:30 p.m. \nNorth New Jersey (Union City): 201-601-4100 \nCentral New Jersey (Freehold): 732-761-2020 \nSouth New Jersey (Vineland): 856-507-2340 \nOut-of-State claims: 1-888-795-6672 \u2014 \nYou must call from a phone with an out-of-state area code \nIMPORTANT:\n All of these phone numbers go to the same place. Local phone numbers are offered as a courtesy for callers who are charged more for long-distance calls. If you are in a phone queue, you will not move ahead by trying one of the other phone numbers. If you hang up to call a different number, you will forfeit your place and be moved to the end of the queue. \nAppeal to the Board of Review \nIf you disagree with the Appeal Tribunal\u2019s decision, you may appeal to the Board of Review. You must do this within 20 days of the mailing date of the Appeal Tribunal\u2019s decision. Instructions on how to do this are on the last page of the Appeal Tribunal decision, which we will mail to you. \nAppeals to the Board of Review must be submitted in writing to: \nBoard of Review \nNew Jersey Department of Labor and Workforce Development \nP.O. Box 937 \nTrenton, NJ 08625-0937 \nThe Board of Review is the highest appellate level within the Department of Labor and Workforce Development. The Board of Review will base its decision on a review of the Appeal Tribunal record. You can find more about the Board of Review online \nhere\n. \nRight to further appeal \nIf you receive an unfavorable decision from the Board of Review, you may appeal the Board\u2019s decision to the Appellate Division of the New Jersey Superior Court. The Court is part of the Judiciary branch of government and is entirely out of this department\u2019s jurisdiction. The Court has its own rules and procedure, costs and requirements. \nFor more information about appealing Board of Review decisions, call the Appellate Division at 609-815-2950 ext. 5-4720. \nYou can get additional information on the appeal process, including frequently asked questions, by \nclicking here\n.",

You can log in to Intuit and set it up yourself, or if you have trouble with that I can do it manually.\n\u00a0\nLet me know if you need anything else!\nSG\n\u00a0\nFrom:\n Juri Mansour <\nj.mansour@lcwmail.com\n> \nSent:\n Tuesday, March 11, 2025 08:44\nTo:\n Accounting <\naccounting@lcwmail.com\n>; Sarah Gluckstein <\ns.gluckstein@lcwmail.com\n>\nSubject:\n Question regarding next pay\nImportance:\n High\n\u00a0\nHi Sarah, I hope you're well.\n\u00a0\nI wanted to ask if you could tell me when I can expect the next payment?

As you can see in the invoice attached, the amount should be \nUSD144.81\n but the payment was only \nUSD22.58\n.\nIt was probably a confusion with my previous invoice, for December, that had exactly this amount (USD22.58). It seems that you paid the amount for the previous invoice, not the one that I've sent to you for February. So there's still a \ndifference of USD122.23\n. Could you please ask your accounting department to arrange the payment of this difference?\nThanks!\nJos\u00e9\n----- Original Message ----- \nFrom:\n \nJorgelina Venturi\n \nTo:\n \nJos\u00e9 Antonio Azevedo\n \nSent:\n Thursday, February 27, 2025 10:04 PM\nSubject:\n Re: Invoice for February\nThis is received, we wlll look into it.\nRegards,\nJorgelina (Lina) Venturi\nTranslation Specialist\nLCW\nFrom: \nJos\u00e9 Antonio Azevedo <\ntranslator@joseazevedo.com\n>\nDate: \nThursday, 27 February 2025 at 6:20\n\u202f\nPM\nTo: \nCatalina De Sanctis <\nc.desanctis@lcwmail.com\n>\nSubject: \nInvoice for February\nHi Catalina,\nI hope you are well!\nHere is my invoice for February, and please confirm if you have received it in good order.\nThanks!\nJos\u00e9\nDisclaimer\nThe information contained in this communication from the sender is confidential.

Donaldson\u00a0\nChief, Economy-Wide Statistics Division\u00a0\nU.S. Census Bureau\nWhat is the Annual Integrated Economic Survey?\nThe \nAnnual Integrated Economic Survey (AIES)\n is a re-engineered survey designed to integrate and replace seven mandatory business surveys into a streamlined single survey. The new format simplifies reporting by consolidating all necessary questions into one convenient platform, requiring you to answer only industry-specific content that directly relates to your company\u2019s activities.\nWith key data items standardized across all sectors, the AIES offers holistic annual picture of the U.S. economy. Your valuable data serve as a critical input in calculating the Gross Domestic Product (GDP), empowering policymakers and businesses, including your own, make informed and data-driven decisions.\nHow do I know this is a legitimate government survey?\nThis survey has been approved by the Office of Management and Budget (OMB).\n\u00a0\nThe eight-digit OMB approval number is 0607-1024 and appears in the lower left corner of each reporting screen. Without this approval, we could not conduct this survey. We are conducting this survey under the authority of Title 13, United States Code, Sections 131 and 182.\nHow long will it take to complete the survey?\nWe estimate the Annual Integrated Economic Survey will take an average of 2.5 hours to complete. Factors such as company size, complexity, and activity will affect your actual time to complete the survey. This estimate includes the time to review instructions, search existing data sources, gather and maintain the data needed, and complete and review the survey.\nWill my response be confidential?\nYes. The U.S. Census Bureau is required by law to keep your response confidential (Title 13, U.S. Code, Section 9). The Census Bureau is not permitted to publicly release your responses in a way that could identify your business, organization, or institution. Per the Federal Cybersecurity Enhancement Act of 2015, your data are protected from cybersecurity risks through screening of the systems that transmit data.\nAm I required to fill out the survey?\nYes. Your business is required by law (Title 13, U.S. Code, Sections 224 and 225) to respond to this survey.\nHow will the Census Bureau use the information I provide?\nBy law, the Census Bureau can only use your business data to produce statistics.\nID: 2015252446\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\nThis email is sent by a computer.

It seems that you paid the amount for the previous invoice, not the one that I've sent to you for February. So there's still a \ndifference of USD122.23\n.

Should I find a time early next week, or do you prefer to schedule?\n\u00a0\nMaybe too much info for you, but here is the pricing based on different scenarios for both HR & IT.

Things are moving so quickly that it's like they're changing every second!\n\u00a0\nAfter I sent the below email, I had a chat with Rippling about maybe having them replace TriNet. They do payroll too.\n\u00a0\nHave you started adding QB payroll yet? I'd like to pause as I consider Rippling as an alternative. Not sure if you have worked with Rippling before...\n\u00a0\nThank you!\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\nFrom:\n\u00a0Nicole Barile\nSent:\n\u00a0Wednesday, March 5, 2025 10:56 AM\nTo:\n\u00a0Accounting <\naccounting@lcwmail.com\n>\nSubject:\n\u00a0QB Payroll + Benefits\n\u00a0\nHey SG!\n\u00a0\nNot sure if you are aware, but TriNet is changing plans, and I'm looking for other options for managing our benefits.\n\u00a0\nI have discovered that QBO offer a similar \"broker\" model through Allstate Health Solutions.\nhttps://quickbooks.intuit.com/r/product-update/allstate-health-solutions-payroll/\n\u00a0\nIt seems that once we add QB payroll, we can then add Benefits (through Allstate), and that this is no extra cost to us.\n\u00a0\nI'm happy to set this up & come to you if I need assistance or another pair of eyes.\n\u00a0\nThe first step is that I connect our existing benefits plan. This doesn't actually initiate a switchover - but it allows us/me to start the process when I'm ready.\n\u00a0\nAnyway...long story short... Can you please lmk when Quickbooks Payroll will be added?\n\u00a0\nThank you!\n\u00a0\nNicole Barile\n\u00a0\n(She/Her)\nChief Operating Officer\nLCW\n\u00a0\nWebsite\n\u00a0\n|\n\u00a0\nTwitter\n\u00a0\n|\n\u00a0\nFacebook\n\u00a0\n|\n\u00a0\nLinkedIn\nView our upcoming events\n\u00a0| \nSign-up for our newsletter",

Things are moving so quickly that it's like they're changing every second!\n\u00a0\nAfter I sent the below email, I had a chat with Rippling about maybe having them replace TriNet. They do payroll too.\n\u00a0\nHave you started adding QB payroll yet? I'd like to pause as I consider Rippling as an alternative. Not sure if you have worked with Rippling before...\n\u00a0\nThank you!\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\nFrom:\n\u00a0Nicole Barile\nSent:\n\u00a0Wednesday, March 5, 2025 10:56 AM\nTo:\n\u00a0Accounting <\naccounting@lcwmail.com\n>\nSubject:\n\u00a0QB Payroll + Benefits\n \n\u00a0\nHey SG!\n\u00a0\nNot sure if you are aware, but TriNet is changing plans, and I'm looking for other options for managing our benefits.\n\u00a0\nI have discovered that QBO offer a similar \"broker\" model through Allstate Health Solutions.\nhttps://quickbooks.intuit.com/r/product-update/allstate-health-solutions-payroll/\n\u00a0\nIt seems that once we add QB payroll, we can then add Benefits (through Allstate), and that this is no extra cost to us.\n\u00a0\nI'm happy to set this up & come to you if I need assistance or another pair of eyes.\n\u00a0\nThe first step is that I connect our existing benefits plan. This doesn't actually initiate a switchover - but it allows us/me to start the process when I'm ready.\n\u00a0\nAnyway...long story short... Can you please lmk when Quickbooks Payroll will be added?\n\u00a0\nThank you!\n\u00a0\nNicole Barile\n\u00a0\n(She/Her)\nChief Operating Officer\nLCW\n\u00a0\nWebsite\n\u00a0\n|\n\u00a0\nTwitter\n\u00a0\n|\n\u00a0\nFacebook\n\u00a0\n|\n\u00a0\nLinkedIn\nView our upcoming events\n\u00a0| \nSign-up for our newsletter",

I wouldn't be able to assist you with how to deduct those funds from your paycheck pretax as that is something your payroll team will need to assist you with. I will be able to help go over how to submit the contributions once they are deducted though.\nSince you are wanting to use the routing and account numbers to submit those contributions, you will just give the routing and account numbers to your payroll company. They will then be able to submit the contributions as direct deposits to those routing and account numbers for you. There are a few things to note with submitting your contributions that way though.\nThe routing and account (PPD) numbers can be found on the employer portal under the reports. There is a quick link on the portal home page that says PPD Account Numbers. The first and most important thing to know about is that\u00a0\nthis page of the employer portal is \nnot\n\u00a0copy and paste compatible, copying and pasting from this page will scramble the numbers to make them incorrect\n. Y\nou will want to use the export button at the top of the page to export the info to an excel spreadsheet if you intend to distribute the info to your payroll team.\u00a0The second important thing to know about PPD contributions is that our system registers all direct deposit contributions as \nEmployee Contributions\n. So, if employer contributions are ever made, our system will track them as employee contributions only.\u00a0\nIf in the future, you decide to make contributions in a different way, you can also submit your pretax contributions through the Manage Money>HSA Contribution>Submit by Employee Listing page in the employer portal. The attached guide can help you set that up if needed.\nIf you have any further questions, please do not hesitate to contact HealthEquity at 866-382-3510 or via Chat in the employer portal.\nWe are available to assist you Monday through Friday, 7AM - 7PM CST.\nThank you,\nCari S.\nClient Services Consultant l\nHealthEquity\nO: 866-382-3510\nemployerservices@healthequity.com\nAt HealthEquity, we\u2019re always looking for ways to create a positive client experience, so your feedback is essential.

I hope this email finds you well.\nI am reaching out to you regarding your HSA card. I am not familiar with TriNet (formerly Zenefits) and how they work, what I do know about payroll groups similar to them is that typically they will submit contributions to your HSAs routing and account numbers. So, they shouldn't need your card at all. I suggest reaching out to them to get some clarification as to why they would be sending you a card. I also suggest you log into your member portal and close the existing card to your account and order a replacement. That way your HSA is not vulnerable to card fraud. The person whose name is on the card (you) should be the only one who has access to that card for the security of the account. Please let me know if that does not help answer your questions. I am happy to continue investigating this issue with you if needed.\nIf you have any further questions, please do not hesitate to contact HealthEquity at 866-382-3510 or via Chat in the employer portal.\nWe are available to assist you Monday through Friday, 7AM - 7PM CST.\nThank you,\nCari S.\nClient Services Consultant l\nHealthEquity\nO: 866-382-3510\nemployerservices@healthequity.com\nAt HealthEquity, we\u2019re always looking for ways to create a positive client experience, so your feedback is essential.

I wouldn't be able to assist you with how to deduct those funds from your paycheck pretax as that is something your payroll team will need to assist you with. I will be able to help go over how to submit the contributions once they are deducted though.\nSince you are wanting to use the routing and account numbers to submit those contributions, you will just give the routing and account numbers to your payroll company. They will then be able to submit the contributions as direct deposits to those routing and account numbers for you. There are a few things to note with submitting your contributions that way though.\nThe routing and account (PPD) numbers can be found on the employer portal under the reports. There is a quick link on the portal home page that says PPD Account Numbers. The first and most important thing to know about is that\u00a0\nthis page of the employer portal is \nnot\n\u00a0copy and paste compatible, copying and pasting from this page will scramble the numbers to make them incorrect\n. Y\nou will want to use the export button at the top of the page to export the info to an excel spreadsheet if you intend to distribute the info to your payroll team.\u00a0The second important thing to know about PPD contributions is that our system registers all direct deposit contributions as \nEmployee Contributions\n. So, if employer contributions are ever made, our system will track them as employee contributions only.\u00a0\nIf in the future, you decide to make contributions in a different way, you can also submit your pretax contributions through the Manage Money>HSA Contribution>Submit by Employee Listing page in the employer portal. The attached guide can help you set that up if needed.\nIf you have any further questions, please do not hesitate to contact HealthEquity at 866-382-3510 or via Chat in the employer portal.\nWe are available to assist you Monday through Friday, 7AM - 7PM CST.\nThank you,\nCari S.\nClient Services Consultant l\nHealthEquity\nO: 866-382-3510\nemployerservices@healthequity.com\nAt HealthEquity, we\u2019re always looking for ways to create a positive client experience, so your feedback is essential.

I hope this email finds you well.\nI am reaching out to you regarding your HSA card. I am not familiar with TriNet (formerly Zenefits) and how they work, what I do know about payroll groups similar to them is that typically they will submit contributions to your HSAs routing and account numbers. So, they shouldn't need your card at all. I suggest reaching out to them to get some clarification as to why they would be sending you a card. I also suggest you log into your member portal and close the existing card to your account and order a replacement. That way your HSA is not vulnerable to card fraud. The person whose name is on the card (you) should be the only one who has access to that card for the security of the account. Please let me know if that does not help answer your questions. I am happy to continue investigating this issue with you if needed.\nIf you have any further questions, please do not hesitate to contact HealthEquity at 866-382-3510 or via Chat in the employer portal.\nWe are available to assist you Monday through Friday, 7AM - 7PM CST.\nThank you,\nCari S.\nClient Services Consultant l\nHealthEquity\nO: 866-382-3510\nemployerservices@healthequity.com\nAt HealthEquity, we\u2019re always looking for ways to create a positive client experience, so your feedback is essential.

I wouldn't be able to assist you with how to deduct those funds from your paycheck pretax as that is something your payroll team will need to assist you with. I will be able to help go over how to submit the contributions once they are deducted though.\nSince you are wanting to use the routing and account numbers to submit those contributions, you will just give the routing and account numbers to your payroll company. They will then be able to submit the contributions as direct deposits to those routing and account numbers for you. There are a few things to note with submitting your contributions that way though.\nThe routing and account (PPD) numbers can be found on the employer portal under the reports. There is a quick link on the portal home page that says PPD Account Numbers. The first and most important thing to know about is that\u00a0\nthis page of the employer portal is \nnot\n\u00a0copy and paste compatible, copying and pasting from this page will scramble the numbers to make them incorrect\n. Y\nou will want to use the export button at the top of the page to export the info to an excel spreadsheet if you intend to distribute the info to your payroll team.\u00a0The second important thing to know about PPD contributions is that our system registers all direct deposit contributions as \nEmployee Contributions\n. So, if employer contributions are ever made, our system will track them as employee contributions only.\u00a0\nIf in the future, you decide to make contributions in a different way, you can also submit your pretax contributions through the Manage Money>HSA Contribution>Submit by Employee Listing page in the employer portal. The attached guide can help you set that up if needed.\nIf you have any further questions, please do not hesitate to contact HealthEquity at 866-382-3510 or via Chat in the employer portal.\nWe are available to assist you Monday through Friday, 7AM - 7PM CST.\nThank you,\nCari S.\nClient Services Consultant l\nHealthEquity\nO: 866-382-3510\nemployerservices@healthequity.com\nAt HealthEquity, we\u2019re always looking for ways to create a positive client experience, so your feedback is essential.

I hope this email finds you well.\nI am reaching out to you regarding your HSA card. I am not familiar with TriNet (formerly Zenefits) and how they work, what I do know about payroll groups similar to them is that typically they will submit contributions to your HSAs routing and account numbers. So, they shouldn't need your card at all. I suggest reaching out to them to get some clarification as to why they would be sending you a card. I also suggest you log into your member portal and close the existing card to your account and order a replacement. That way your HSA is not vulnerable to card fraud. The person whose name is on the card (you) should be the only one who has access to that card for the security of the account. Please let me know if that does not help answer your questions. I am happy to continue investigating this issue with you if needed.\nIf you have any further questions, please do not hesitate to contact HealthEquity at 866-382-3510 or via Chat in the employer portal.\nWe are available to assist you Monday through Friday, 7AM - 7PM CST.\nThank you,\nCari S.\nClient Services Consultant l\nHealthEquity\nO: 866-382-3510\nemployerservices@healthequity.com\nAt HealthEquity, we\u2019re always looking for ways to create a positive client experience, so your feedback is essential.

I wouldn't be able to assist you with how to deduct those funds from your paycheck pretax as that is something your payroll team will need to assist you with. I will be able to help go over how to submit the contributions once they are deducted though.\nSince you are wanting to use the routing and account numbers to submit those contributions, you will just give the routing and account numbers to your payroll company. They will then be able to submit the contributions as direct deposits to those routing and account numbers for you. There are a few things to note with submitting your contributions that way though.\nThe routing and account (PPD) numbers can be found on the employer portal under the reports. There is a quick link on the portal home page that says PPD Account Numbers. The first and most important thing to know about is that\u00a0\nthis page of the employer portal is \nnot\n\u00a0copy and paste compatible, copying and pasting from this page will scramble the numbers to make them incorrect\n. Y\nou will want to use the export button at the top of the page to export the info to an excel spreadsheet if you intend to distribute the info to your payroll team.\u00a0The second important thing to know about PPD contributions is that our system registers all direct deposit contributions as \nEmployee Contributions\n. So, if employer contributions are ever made, our system will track them as employee contributions only.\u00a0\nIf in the future, you decide to make contributions in a different way, you can also submit your pretax contributions through the Manage Money>HSA Contribution>Submit by Employee Listing page in the employer portal. The attached guide can help you set that up if needed.\nIf you have any further questions, please do not hesitate to contact HealthEquity at 866-382-3510 or via Chat in the employer portal.\nWe are available to assist you Monday through Friday, 7AM - 7PM CST.\nThank you,\nCari S.\nClient Services Consultant l\nHealthEquity\nO: 866-382-3510\nemployerservices@healthequity.com\nAt HealthEquity, we\u2019re always looking for ways to create a positive client experience, so your feedback is essential.

I hope this email finds you well.\nI am reaching out to you regarding your HSA card. I am not familiar with TriNet (formerly Zenefits) and how they work, what I do know about payroll groups similar to them is that typically they will submit contributions to your HSAs routing and account numbers. So, they shouldn't need your card at all. I suggest reaching out to them to get some clarification as to why they would be sending you a card. I also suggest you log into your member portal and close the existing card to your account and order a replacement. That way your HSA is not vulnerable to card fraud. The person whose name is on the card (you) should be the only one who has access to that card for the security of the account. Please let me know if that does not help answer your questions. I am happy to continue investigating this issue with you if needed.\nIf you have any further questions, please do not hesitate to contact HealthEquity at 866-382-3510 or via Chat in the employer portal.\nWe are available to assist you Monday through Friday, 7AM - 7PM CST.\nThank you,\nCari S.\nClient Services Consultant l\nHealthEquity\nO: 866-382-3510\nemployerservices@healthequity.com\nAt HealthEquity, we\u2019re always looking for ways to create a positive client experience, so your feedback is essential. Based on your most recent email interaction, a very brief survey from \nCustomerExperience@feedback.healthequity.com\n may be presented, and we\u2019d greatly appreciate hearing from you.

I wouldn't be able to assist you with how to deduct those funds from your paycheck pretax as that is something your payroll team will need to assist you with. I will be able to help go over how to submit the contributions once they are deducted though.\nSince you are wanting to use the routing and account numbers to submit those contributions, you will just give the routing and account numbers to your payroll company. They will then be able to submit the contributions as direct deposits to those routing and account numbers for you. There are a few things to note with submitting your contributions that way though.\nThe routing and account (PPD) numbers can be found on the employer portal under the reports. There is a quick link on the portal home page that says PPD Account Numbers. The first and most important thing to know about is that\u00a0\nthis page of the employer portal is \nnot\n\u00a0copy and paste compatible, copying and pasting from this page will scramble the numbers to make them incorrect\n. Y\nou will want to use the export button at the top of the page to export the info to an excel spreadsheet if you intend to distribute the info to your payroll team.\u00a0The second important thing to know about PPD contributions is that our system registers all direct deposit contributions as \nEmployee Contributions\n. So, if employer contributions are ever made, our system will track them as employee contributions only.\u00a0\nIf in the future, you decide to make contributions in a different way, you can also submit your pretax contributions through the Manage Money>HSA Contribution>Submit by Employee Listing page in the employer portal. The attached guide can help you set that up if needed.\nIf you have any further questions, please do not hesitate to contact HealthEquity at 866-382-3510 or via Chat in the employer portal.\nWe are available to assist you Monday through Friday, 7AM - 7PM CST.\nThank you,\nCari S.\nClient Services Consultant l\nHealthEquity\nO: 866-382-3510\nemployerservices@healthequity.com\nAt HealthEquity, we\u2019re always looking for ways to create a positive client experience, so your feedback is essential.

I hope this email finds you well.\nI am reaching out to you regarding your HSA card. I am not familiar with TriNet (formerly Zenefits) and how they work, what I do know about payroll groups similar to them is that typically they will submit contributions to your HSAs routing and account numbers. So, they shouldn't need your card at all. I suggest reaching out to them to get some clarification as to why they would be sending you a card. I also suggest you log into your member portal and close the existing card to your account and order a replacement. That way your HSA is not vulnerable to card fraud. The person whose name is on the card (you) should be the only one who has access to that card for the security of the account. Please let me know if that does not help answer your questions. I am happy to continue investigating this issue with you if needed.\nIf you have any further questions, please do not hesitate to contact HealthEquity at 866-382-3510 or via Chat in the employer portal.\nWe are available to assist you Monday through Friday, 7AM - 7PM CST.\nThank you,\nCari S.\nClient Services Consultant l\nHealthEquity\nO: 866-382-3510\nemployerservices@healthequity.com\nAt HealthEquity, we\u2019re always looking for ways to create a positive client experience, so your feedback is essential.

More HSA stuff \n\ud83d\ude42\n.\n\u00a0\nIt seems setting up the HSA through TriNet was not the correct route. I'm just going to ignore that (not bother to cancel) since we won't be using them much longer.\n\u00a0\nI've investigated on my own & think I understand what needs to be done.\n\u00a0\nI set up a new payroll deduction type in TriNet - HSA - pre-tax.

I wouldn't be able to assist you with how to deduct those funds from your paycheck pretax as that is something your payroll team will need to assist you with. I will be able to help go over how to submit the contributions once they are deducted though.\nSince you are wanting to use the routing and account numbers to submit those contributions, you will just give the routing and account numbers to your payroll company. They will then be able to submit the contributions as direct deposits to those routing and account numbers for you. There are a few things to note with submitting your contributions that way though.\nThe routing and account (PPD) numbers can be found on the employer portal under the reports. There is a quick link on the portal home page that says PPD Account Numbers. The first and most important thing to know about is that\u00a0\nthis page of the employer portal is \nnot\n\u00a0copy and paste compatible, copying and pasting from this page will scramble the numbers to make them incorrect\n. Y\nou will want to use the export button at the top of the page to export the info to an excel spreadsheet if you intend to distribute the info to your payroll team.\u00a0The second important thing to know about PPD contributions is that our system registers all direct deposit contributions as \nEmployee Contributions\n. So, if employer contributions are ever made, our system will track them as employee contributions only.\u00a0\nIf in the future, you decide to make contributions in a different way, you can also submit your pretax contributions through the Manage Money>HSA Contribution>Submit by Employee Listing page in the employer portal. The attached guide can help you set that up if needed.\nIf you have any further questions, please do not hesitate to contact HealthEquity at 866-382-3510 or via Chat in the employer portal.\nWe are available to assist you Monday through Friday, 7AM - 7PM CST.\nThank you,\nCari S.\nClient Services Consultant l\nHealthEquity\nO: 866-382-3510\nemployerservices@healthequity.com\nAt HealthEquity, we\u2019re always looking for ways to create a positive client experience, so your feedback is essential.

I hope this email finds you well.\nI am reaching out to you regarding your HSA card. I am not familiar with TriNet (formerly Zenefits) and how they work, what I do know about payroll groups similar to them is that typically they will submit contributions to your HSAs routing and account numbers. So, they shouldn't need your card at all. I suggest reaching out to them to get some clarification as to why they would be sending you a card. I also suggest you log into your member portal and close the existing card to your account and order a replacement. That way your HSA is not vulnerable to card fraud. The person whose name is on the card (you) should be the only one who has access to that card for the security of the account. Please let me know if that does not help answer your questions. I am happy to continue investigating this issue with you if needed.\nIf you have any further questions, please do not hesitate to contact HealthEquity at 866-382-3510 or via Chat in the employer portal.\nWe are available to assist you Monday through Friday, 7AM - 7PM CST.\nThank you,\nCari S.\nClient Services Consultant l\nHealthEquity\nO: 866-382-3510\nemployerservices@healthequity.com\nAt HealthEquity, we\u2019re always looking for ways to create a positive client experience, so your feedback is essential.

Or, can we just agree to pay all consultants. We are actively working with these folks.\n\u00a0\nHappy to hop on a call tomorrow but wanted this sent to you asap as I need Patricia to confirm some trainings for me, and she doesn't want to.\n\u00a0\nThanks!\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\nNicole Barile\n\u00a0\n(She/Her)\nChief Operating Officer\nLCW\n\u00a0\nWebsite\n\u00a0\n|\n\u00a0\nTwitter\n\u00a0\n|\n\u00a0\nFacebook\n\u00a0\n|\n\u00a0\nLinkedIn\nView our upcoming events\n\u00a0| \nSign-up for our newsletter",

I wouldn't be able to assist you with how to deduct those funds from your paycheck pretax as that is something your payroll team will need to assist you with. I will be able to help go over how to submit the contributions once they are deducted though.\nSince you are wanting to use the routing and account numbers to submit those contributions, you will just give the routing and account numbers to your payroll company. They will then be able to submit the contributions as direct deposits to those routing and account numbers for you. There are a few things to note with submitting your contributions that way though.\nThe routing and account (PPD) numbers can be found on the employer portal under the reports. There is a quick link on the portal home page that says PPD Account Numbers. The first and most important thing to know about is that\u00a0\nthis page of the employer portal is \nnot\n\u00a0copy and paste compatible, copying and pasting from this page will scramble the numbers to make them incorrect\n. Y\nou will want to use the export button at the top of the page to export the info to an excel spreadsheet if you intend to distribute the info to your payroll team.\u00a0The second important thing to know about PPD contributions is that our system registers all direct deposit contributions as \nEmployee Contributions\n. So, if employer contributions are ever made, our system will track them as employee contributions only.\u00a0\nIf in the future, you decide to make contributions in a different way, you can also submit your pretax contributions through the Manage Money>HSA Contribution>Submit by Employee Listing page in the employer portal. The attached guide can help you set that up if needed.\nIf you have any further questions, please do not hesitate to contact HealthEquity at 866-382-3510 or via Chat in the employer portal.\nWe are available to assist you Monday through Friday, 7AM - 7PM CST.\nThank you,\nCari S.\nClient Services Consultant l\nHealthEquity\nO: 866-382-3510\nemployerservices@healthequity.com\nAt HealthEquity, we\u2019re always looking for ways to create a positive client experience, so your feedback is essential.

I hope this email finds you well.\nI am reaching out to you regarding your HSA card. I am not familiar with TriNet (formerly Zenefits) and how they work, what I do know about payroll groups similar to them is that typically they will submit contributions to your HSAs routing and account numbers. So, they shouldn't need your card at all. I suggest reaching out to them to get some clarification as to why they would be sending you a card. I also suggest you log into your member portal and close the existing card to your account and order a replacement. That way your HSA is not vulnerable to card fraud. The person whose name is on the card (you) should be the only one who has access to that card for the security of the account. Please let me know if that does not help answer your questions. I am happy to continue investigating this issue with you if needed.\nIf you have any further questions, please do not hesitate to contact HealthEquity at 866-382-3510 or via Chat in the employer portal.\nWe are available to assist you Monday through Friday, 7AM - 7PM CST.\nThank you,\nCari S.\nClient Services Consultant l\nHealthEquity\nO: 866-382-3510\nemployerservices@healthequity.com\nAt HealthEquity, we\u2019re always looking for ways to create a positive client experience, so your feedback is essential.

More HSA stuff \n\ud83d\ude42\n.\n\u00a0\nIt seems setting up the HSA through TriNet was not the correct route.

See screenshot.\n\u00a0\nHere are more instructions: \nhttps://help.zenefits.com/Payroll/Payroll_App/Managing_Deductions__Contributions/How_do_I_add_a_one-time_deduction_or_contribution_to_employees_in_Payroll%3F?mt-view=f1\n.\n\u00a0\nI haven't gone further, as I'm not 100% sure if this is correct.\nDo you think it is?\n\u00a0\nWhat I don't know is how to tell the system to send the money to my Health Equity HSA account.

I wouldn't be able to assist you with how to deduct those funds from your paycheck pretax as that is something your payroll team will need to assist you with. I will be able to help go over how to submit the contributions once they are deducted though.\nSince you are wanting to use the routing and account numbers to submit those contributions, you will just give the routing and account numbers to your payroll company. They will then be able to submit the contributions as direct deposits to those routing and account numbers for you. There are a few things to note with submitting your contributions that way though.\nThe routing and account (PPD) numbers can be found on the employer portal under the reports. There is a quick link on the portal home page that says PPD Account Numbers. The first and most important thing to know about is that\u00a0\nthis page of the employer portal is \nnot\n\u00a0copy and paste compatible, copying and pasting from this page will scramble the numbers to make them incorrect\n. Y\nou will want to use the export button at the top of the page to export the info to an excel spreadsheet if you intend to distribute the info to your payroll team.\u00a0The second important thing to know about PPD contributions is that our system registers all direct deposit contributions as \nEmployee Contributions\n.

I hope this email finds you well.\nI am reaching out to you regarding your HSA card. I am not familiar with TriNet (formerly Zenefits) and how they work, what I do know about payroll groups similar to them is that typically they will submit contributions to your HSAs routing and account numbers. So, they shouldn't need your card at all. I suggest reaching out to them to get some clarification as to why they would be sending you a card. I also suggest you log into your member portal and close the existing card to your account and order a replacement. That way your HSA is not vulnerable to card fraud. The person whose name is on the card (you) should be the only one who has access to that card for the security of the account. Please let me know if that does not help answer your questions. I am happy to continue investigating this issue with you if needed.\nIf you have any further questions, please do not hesitate to contact HealthEquity at 866-382-3510 or via Chat in the employer portal.\nWe are available to assist you Monday through Friday, 7AM - 7PM CST.\nThank you,\nCari S.\nClient Services Consultant l\nHealthEquity\nO: 866-382-3510\nemployerservices@healthequity.com\nAt HealthEquity, we\u2019re always looking for ways to create a positive client experience, so your feedback is essential.

More HSA stuff \n\ud83d\ude42\n.\n\u00a0\nIt seems setting up the HSA through TriNet was not the correct route.

I wouldn't be able to assist you with how to deduct those funds from your paycheck pretax as that is something your payroll team will need to assist you with. I will be able to help go over how to submit the contributions once they are deducted though.\nSince you are wanting to use the routing and account numbers to submit those contributions, you will just give the routing and account numbers to your payroll company. They will then be able to submit the contributions as direct deposits to those routing and account numbers for you. There are a few things to note with submitting your contributions that way though.\nThe routing and account (PPD) numbers can be found on the employer portal under the reports. There is a quick link on the portal home page that says PPD Account Numbers. The first and most important thing to know about is that\u00a0\nthis page of the employer portal is \nnot\n\u00a0copy and paste compatible, copying and pasting from this page will scramble the numbers to make them incorrect\n. Y\nou will want to use the export button at the top of the page to export the info to an excel spreadsheet if you intend to distribute the info to your payroll team.\u00a0The second important thing to know about PPD contributions is that our system registers all direct deposit contributions as \nEmployee Contributions\n. So, if employer contributions are ever made, our system will track them as employee contributions only.\u00a0\nIf in the future, you decide to make contributions in a different way, you can also submit your pretax contributions through the Manage Money>HSA Contribution>Submit by Employee Listing page in the employer portal.

I think I did a bad job explaining what happened ?.\nI'm not worried about fraud and don't want to close the card.\nI was trying to add our Health Equity account to our HR system and was having trouble. But now I realize that's not what I need to do.\n\u00a0\nMy goal is to deduct money from our payroll for an employee (me) to add to my Health Equity HSA account.\n\u00a0\nI have the Health Equity-generated routing # & bank account number for me.\nWhat do we do next? How do we take the money out of my paycheck & put into my HSA. Is this managed in our Health Equity account, or do you know if we have to set it up in our HRIS system?\u00a0\nI may need to call to explain better ?.\n\u00a0\nThank you!\nNicole\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\nNicole Barile\n\u00a0\n(She/Her)\nChief Operating Officer\nLCW\n\u00a0\nWebsite\n\u00a0\n|\n\u00a0\nTwitter\n\u00a0\n|\n\u00a0\nFacebook\n\u00a0\n|\n\u00a0\nLinkedIn\nView our upcoming events\n\u00a0| \nSign-up for our newsletter\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\nFrom:\n CS Email <\nemployerservices@healthequity.com\n>\nSent:\n Friday, February 21, 2025 3:10 PM\nTo:\n Nicole Barile <\nn.barile@lcwmail.com\n>\nSubject:\n Re: Questions about our company HSA - [ ref:!00D300ESC.!5006Q02RM4nO:ref ]\n \n\u00a0\nHello Nicole,\nThank you for contacting HealthEquity regarding your account. I hope this email finds you well.\nI am reaching out to you regarding your HSA card. I am not familiar with TriNet (formerly Zenefits) and how they work, what I do know about payroll groups similar to them is that typically they will submit contributions to your HSAs routing and account numbers. So, they shouldn't need your card at all. I suggest reaching out to them to get some clarification as to why they would be sending you a card. I also suggest you log into your member portal and close the existing card to your account and order a replacement. That way your HSA is not vulnerable to card fraud. The person whose name is on the card (you) should be the only one who has access to that card for the security of the account. Please let me know if that does not help answer your questions. I am happy to continue investigating this issue with you if needed.\nIf you have any further questions, please do not hesitate to contact HealthEquity at 866-382-3510 or via Chat in the employer portal.\nWe are available to assist you Monday through Friday, 7AM - 7PM CST.\nThank you,\nCari S.\nClient Services Consultant l\nHealthEquity\nO: 866-382-3510\nemployerservices@healthequity.com\nAt HealthEquity, we\u2019re always looking for ways to create a positive client experience, so your feedback is essential.

I wouldn't be able to assist you with how to deduct those funds from your paycheck pretax as that is something your payroll team will need to assist you with. I will be able to help go over how to submit the contributions once they are deducted though.\nSince you are wanting to use the routing and account numbers to submit those contributions, you will just give the routing and account numbers to your payroll company. They will then be able to submit the contributions as direct deposits to those routing and account numbers for you. There are a few things to note with submitting your contributions that way though.\nThe routing and account (PPD) numbers can be found on the employer portal under the reports. There is a quick link on the portal home page that says PPD Account Numbers. The first and most important thing to know about is that\u00a0\nthis page of the employer portal is \nnot\n\u00a0copy and paste compatible, copying and pasting from this page will scramble the numbers to make them incorrect\n. Y\nou will want to use the export button at the top of the page to export the info to an excel spreadsheet if you intend to distribute the info to your payroll team.\u00a0The second important thing to know about PPD contributions is that our system registers all direct deposit contributions as \nEmployee Contributions\n. So, if employer contributions are ever made, our system will track them as employee contributions only.\u00a0\nIf in the future, you decide to make contributions in a different way, you can also submit your pretax contributions through the Manage Money>HSA Contribution>Submit by Employee Listing page in the employer portal. The attached guide can help you set that up if needed.\nIf you have any further questions, please do not hesitate to contact HealthEquity at 866-382-3510 or via Chat in the employer portal.\nWe are available to assist you Monday through Friday, 7AM - 7PM CST.\nThank you,\nCari S.\nClient Services Consultant l\nHealthEquity\nO: 866-382-3510\nemployerservices@healthequity.com\nAt HealthEquity, we\u2019re always looking for ways to create a positive client experience, so your feedback is essential.

I hope this email finds you well.\nI am reaching out to you regarding your HSA card. I am not familiar with TriNet (formerly Zenefits) and how they work, what I do know about payroll groups similar to them is that typically they will submit contributions to your HSAs routing and account numbers. So, they shouldn't need your card at all. I suggest reaching out to them to get some clarification as to why they would be sending you a card. I also suggest you log into your member portal and close the existing card to your account and order a replacement. That way your HSA is not vulnerable to card fraud. The person whose name is on the card (you) should be the only one who has access to that card for the security of the account. Please let me know if that does not help answer your questions. I am happy to continue investigating this issue with you if needed.\nIf you have any further questions, please do not hesitate to contact HealthEquity at 866-382-3510 or via Chat in the employer portal.\nWe are available to assist you Monday through Friday, 7AM - 7PM CST.\nThank you,\nCari S.\nClient Services Consultant l\nHealthEquity\nO: 866-382-3510\nemployerservices@healthequity.com\nAt HealthEquity, we\u2019re always looking for ways to create a positive client experience, so your feedback is essential.

That covers a lot. \nIs there a list of what it covers?\n \nWe would need to have a detailed conversation around what you need. \nWhat we are most interested in is shortening the sessions to 45 min. Also, this might already be accounted for, but want to make sure the recording is conducive to someone watching the replay (i.e., if there is a 5 min breakout session, the viewer will not have to wait 5 min for the breakout session to take place). \nAbility to have recordings available on our employee intranet for 1 year \nYes. We can do that. Does your platform allow for SCORM files or will you need a simple recording?\n \nWe will need an .mov or .mp4 file\nOn our call you mentioned the price would vary based on audience size. What audience size does the current proposal reflect? \nThe predicted audience size only impacts the cost of the recorded session. We price those like elearnings, based on audience size. If you can remind me of the audience size I can price that out.\n \nThe expected number of replays is 2,000 employees\nWe didn\u2019t discuss this on our call but curious if you have any existing resources available for post-election programming. \nWe are building a course on Civility in Dialog, with the recent political polarization in mind. Simply put, how do we remain civil in what some consider uncivil times. \u00a0And we will soon have a Religious Inclusion course for folks who are feeling left out of conversations around inclusion in the workplace.\n \nThanks for the insight. What is the anticipated availability date for these sessions? \n\u00a0\nLet me know if I can clarify anything and feel free to call me with questions. \n\u00a0\nThanks again!\n\u00a0\nJenny \n\u00a0\n\u00a0\nJENNY JONES\nCommunity Partnerships\u00a0\nEquality & Belonging\n(303) 550-2241\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\nFrom: \nPedro Seminario <\nP.seminario@lcwmail.com\n>\nDate: \nThursday, December 12, 2024 at 2:03\u202fPM\nTo: \nJenny Jones <\nJenny_Jones@gap.com\n>\nCc: \nJason Lopez <\nJason_Lopez@gap.com\n>, Chuck Adams <\nc.adams@lcwmail.com\n>\nSubject: \nRE: [External]LCW & Gap Follow up: Spotlight Previews\n\u00a0\nHi Jenny,\n\u00a0\nGreat timing and thank you for your email.

At the end of February, we can reevaluate adding recordings for the remaining four sessions based on the number of replays from BHM. The 2,000 audience size figure was an educated estimate, and we\u2019d appreciate the opportunity to measure replays to provide a more accurate number.\n\u00a0\nWe also understand that the 50% discount was contingent upon purchasing five courses. In good faith, we were hoping you might consider honoring the discount for BHM with the understanding that we plan to purchase the additional four courses once we have a better sense of replay engagement.\n\u00a0\nFor BHM, we\u2019d like to schedule the session for the first week of February and can coordinate specific dates based on mutual availability.\n\u00a0\nLastly, please let us know who your accounting contact is so we can start getting LCW set up with EVED, our payment platform. \n\u00a0\nThank you very much for your consideration.

Below I\u2019ve outlined a few follow-up questions + notes around what we\u2019d like to explore adding: \n\u00a0\nOption to build in some customization to each workshop. For example, shorten to 45 mins if possible, and ensuring sessions are conducive to a live audience and pre-recorded sessions. \nSure. Customizations start at $750 depending on the level of customization. That covers a lot. \nIs there a list of what it covers?\n \nWe would need to have a detailed conversation around what you need. \nWhat we are most interested in is shortening the sessions to 45 min. Also, this might already be accounted for, but want to make sure the recording is conducive to someone watching the replay (i.e., if there is a 5 min breakout session, the viewer will not have to wait 5 min for the breakout session to take place). \nAbility to have recordings available on our employee intranet for 1 year \nYes. We can do that. Does your platform allow for SCORM files or will you need a simple recording?\n \nWe will need an .mov or .mp4 file\nOn our call you mentioned the price would vary based on audience size. What audience size does the current proposal reflect? \nThe predicted audience size only impacts the cost of the recorded session. We price those like elearnings, based on audience size. If you can remind me of the audience size I can price that out.\n \nThe expected number of replays is 2,000 employees\nWe didn\u2019t discuss this on our call but curious if you have any existing resources available for post-election programming. \nWe are building a course on Civility in Dialog, with the recent political polarization in mind. Simply put, how do we remain civil in what some consider uncivil times. \u00a0And we will soon have a Religious Inclusion course for folks who are feeling left out of conversations around inclusion in the workplace.\n \nThanks for the insight. What is the anticipated availability date for these sessions? \n\u00a0\nLet me know if I can clarify anything and feel free to call me with questions. \n\u00a0\nThanks again!\n\u00a0\nJenny \n\u00a0\n\u00a0\nJENNY JONES\nCommunity Partnerships\u00a0\nEquality & Belonging\n(303) 550-2241\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\nFrom: \nPedro Seminario <\nP.seminario@lcwmail.com\n>\nDate: \nThursday, December 12, 2024 at 2:03\u202fPM\nTo: \nJenny Jones <\nJenny_Jones@gap.com\n>\nCc: \nJason Lopez <\nJason_Lopez@gap.com\n>, Chuck Adams <\nc.adams@lcwmail.com\n>\nSubject: \nRE: [External]LCW & Gap Follow up: Spotlight Previews\n\u00a0\nHi Jenny,\n\u00a0\nGreat timing and thank you for your email.

At the end of February, we can reevaluate adding recordings for the remaining four sessions based on the number of replays from BHM. The 2,000 audience size figure was an educated estimate, and we\u2019d appreciate the opportunity to measure replays to provide a more accurate number.\n\u00a0\nWe also understand that the 50% discount was contingent upon purchasing five courses. In good faith, we were hoping you might consider honoring the discount for BHM with the understanding that we plan to purchase the additional four courses once we have a better sense of replay engagement.\n\u00a0\nFor BHM, we\u2019d like to schedule the session for the first week of February and can coordinate specific dates based on mutual availability.\n\u00a0\nLastly, please let us know who your accounting contact is so we can start getting LCW set up with EVED, our payment platform. \n\u00a0\nThank you very much for your consideration. We look forward to hearing your thoughts.\n\u00a0\nJenny\n\u00a0\nFrom: \nChuck Adams <\nc.adams@lcwmail.com\n>\nDate: \nWednesday, December 18, 2024 at 12:44\u202fPM\nTo: \nJenny Jones <\nJenny_Jones@gap.com\n>, Pedro Seminario <\nP.seminario@lcwmail.com\n>\nCc: \nJason Lopez <\nJason_Lopez@gap.com\n>\nSubject: \nRE: [External]LCW & Gap Follow up: Spotlight Previews\n\u00a0\nHi, Jenny and Jason!\n\u00a0\nAttached is the updated statement of work for you to socialize with leadership.

Apologies for the delay. Yesterday got away from me.\n\u00a0\nI appreciate the opportunity to clarify. I should have been more precise. The regular pricing for a recording kept for one year is $10,500 per course for the audience suggested. Given that you folks are purchasing 5 courses and that Tish is a valued partner we can reduce that by 50% for each course, or $5,250 for each recording for access for up to 2,000 learners over 12 months.\n\u00a0\nAlso, your folks can certainly run the session. We will require a tech run through to ensure a seamless experience for learners.\n\u00a0\nWe will write up the session and send you an SOW to react to with the details above.\n\u00a0\nChuck\n\u00a0\nChuck Adams\n \n(He/Him)\nChief Executive Officer\nLCW\nOffice: \n+1.773.938.4285\nMobile: +1.630.373.5068\n\u00a0\nWebsite\n\u00a0\n|\n\u00a0\nTwitter\n \n|\n\u00a0\nFacebook\n\u00a0\n|\n\u00a0\nLinkedIn\nView our upcoming events\n \n| \nSign-up for our newsletter\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\nFrom:\n Jenny Jones <\nJenny_Jones@gap.com\n> \nSent:\n Tuesday, December 17, 2024 1:40 PM\nTo:\n Chuck Adams <\nc.adams@lcwmail.com\n>; Pedro Seminario <\nP.seminario@lcwmail.com\n>\nCc:\n Jason Lopez <\nJason_Lopez@gap.com\n>\nSubject:\n Re: [External]LCW & Gap Follow up: Spotlight Previews\n\u00a0\nThank you, Chuck!\n\u00a0\nCan you please confirm that the incremental $10,500 would be inclusive of all 5 recorded sessions?

Below I\u2019ve outlined a few follow-up questions + notes around what we\u2019d like to explore adding: \n\u00a0\nOption to build in some customization to each workshop. For example, shorten to 45 mins if possible, and ensuring sessions are conducive to a live audience and pre-recorded sessions. \nSure. Customizations start at $750 depending on the level of customization. That covers a lot. \nIs there a list of what it covers?\n \nWe would need to have a detailed conversation around what you need. \nWhat we are most interested in is shortening the sessions to 45 min. Also, this might already be accounted for, but want to make sure the recording is conducive to someone watching the replay (i.e., if there is a 5 min breakout session, the viewer will not have to wait 5 min for the breakout session to take place). \nAbility to have recordings available on our employee intranet for 1 year \nYes. We can do that. Does your platform allow for SCORM files or will you need a simple recording?\n \nWe will need an .mov or .mp4 file\nOn our call you mentioned the price would vary based on audience size. What audience size does the current proposal reflect? \nThe predicted audience size only impacts the cost of the recorded session. We price those like elearnings, based on audience size. If you can remind me of the audience size I can price that out.\n \nThe expected number of replays is 2,000 employees\nWe didn\u2019t discuss this on our call but curious if you have any existing resources available for post-election programming. \nWe are building a course on Civility in Dialog, with the recent political polarization in mind. Simply put, how do we remain civil in what some consider uncivil times. \u00a0And we will soon have a Religious Inclusion course for folks who are feeling left out of conversations around inclusion in the workplace.\n \nThanks for the insight. What is the anticipated availability date for these sessions? \n\u00a0\nLet me know if I can clarify anything and feel free to call me with questions. \n\u00a0\nThanks again!\n\u00a0\nJenny \n\u00a0\n\u00a0\nJENNY JONES\nCommunity Partnerships\u00a0\nEquality & Belonging\n(303) 550-2241\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\nFrom: \nPedro Seminario <\nP.seminario@lcwmail.com\n>\nDate: \nThursday, December 12, 2024 at 2:03\u202fPM\nTo: \nJenny Jones <\nJenny_Jones@gap.com\n>\nCc: \nJason Lopez <\nJason_Lopez@gap.com\n>, Chuck Adams <\nc.adams@lcwmail.com\n>\nSubject: \nRE: [External]LCW & Gap Follow up: Spotlight Previews\n\u00a0\nHi Jenny,\n\u00a0\nGreat timing and thank you for your email.

Rainier here, and I'm happy to help you today!\n\u00a0\nI've reviewed the details of your ticket and will ensure a smooth continuation from where we last left off.\u00a0\n\u00a0\nTaking a look, I see that you're trying to regain the access of the Squarespace account that manages \nlcwmail.consulting\n.\n\u00a0\nNo worries, we can assist in transferring the ownership of the account.\u00a0\n\u00a0\nTo continue helping in the most secure way possible, I\u2019ll need to verify your identity as the owner of the site. To do that, I\u2019ll need two pieces of information. Could you reply with a picture, scan, or .pdf of:\n1) A bank statement or credit card statement that includes your most recent payment for a Squarespace subscription. The statement must include:\n- A header showing the banking institution that issued it\n- The bank account holder name\n- A line item for your most recent payment to Squarespace or SQSP, including the charge date and amount\nIf you purchased the Squarespace subscription with PayPal, the PayPal statement should include:\n- The full header of the PayPal statement\n- The PayPal account holder name\n- The line item for your most recent payment to Squarespace or SQSP, including the charge date and amount\n2) A government-issued ID displaying your name, such as a driver\u2019s license, passport, or permanent resident card.\nYou\u2019re free to redact or blur any extra information from the statement or ID as long as we can see the details listed above. We\u2019ll fully redact the files from our system after evaluating them. We only use these images for identification purposes, and won\u2019t share or distribute them outside of our secure system.\n\u00a0\nI want to make sure everything is in order for you so let me know if there is anything you need! I'll keep an eye out for your response.\n\u00a0\nBest,\u00a0\nRainier F.\nShe/her/hers\n\"I eat dessert before main course!\"\nhttp://support.squarespace.com\n[VV06KX-74M0R]",

So the name on the statement should match the ID, and if your name isn't the one on the statement you'll want to have them reach out to us instead.\u00a0\n\u00a0\nIf the statement includes a company name instead of a person's name that's okay, you can send your ID and the statement.\u00a0\nNicole Barile\n\u00a0\n(She/Her)\nChief Operating Officer\nLCW\nWebsite\n\u00a0\n|\n\u00a0\nTwitter\n\u00a0\n|\n\u00a0\nFacebook\n\u00a0\n|\n\u00a0\nLinkedIn\nView our upcoming events\n\u00a0| \nSign-up for our newsletter\nFrom:\n\u00a0Squarespace Customer Care <customercare@squarespace.com>\nSent:\n\u00a0Thursday, February 13, 2025 4:10 PM\nTo:\n\u00a0Nicole Barile <n.barile@lcwmail.com>\nSubject:\n\u00a0[Support] Re: $6 charge to our company\n \n\u00a0\n##- Please type your reply above this line -##\nYour request (11629549) has been updated.

Rainier here, and I'm happy to help you today!\n\u00a0\nI've reviewed the details of your ticket and will ensure a smooth continuation from where we last left off.\u00a0\n\u00a0\nTaking a look, I see that you're trying to regain the access of the Squarespace account that manages \nlcwmail.consulting\n.\n\u00a0\nNo worries, we can assist in transferring the ownership of the account.\u00a0\n\u00a0\nTo continue helping in the most secure way possible, I\u2019ll need to verify your identity as the owner of the site. To do that, I\u2019ll need two pieces of information. Could you reply with a picture, scan, or .pdf of:\n1) A bank statement or credit card statement that includes your most recent payment for a Squarespace subscription. The statement must include:\n- A header showing the banking institution that issued it\n- The bank account holder name\n- A line item for your most recent payment to Squarespace or SQSP, including the charge date and amount\nIf you purchased the Squarespace subscription with PayPal, the PayPal statement should include:\n- The full header of the PayPal statement\n- The PayPal account holder name\n- The line item for your most recent payment to Squarespace or SQSP, including the charge date and amount\n2) A government-issued ID displaying your name, such as a driver\u2019s license, passport, or permanent resident card.\nYou\u2019re free to redact or blur any extra information from the statement or ID as long as we can see the details listed above. We\u2019ll fully redact the files from our system after evaluating them. We only use these images for identification purposes, and won\u2019t share or distribute them outside of our secure system.\n\u00a0\nI want to make sure everything is in order for you so let me know if there is anything you need! I'll keep an eye out for your response.\n\u00a0\nBest,\u00a0\nRainier F.\nShe/her/hers\n\"I eat dessert before main course!\"\nhttp://support.squarespace.com\n[VV06KX-74M0R]",

Glad to have you on board.\n\u00a0\nTo get started, I will need the name and physical address of your bank in the US.

If that\u2019s the case, then all I need is the bank account info. If you are a US taxpayer, I need your form W9.\n\u00a0\nI have attached the Q1 time sheet for you. You\u2019ll submit this twice a month (after the 15\nth\n and after the 1\nst\n) to Nicole for approval (attaching a copy of the file), and pay is processed about the 1\nst\n or 15\nth\n half a month after the sheet is submitted (usually takes a few days to get into the account). Please let me know if you have any questions about how to fill it out, we can always hop on a call. For this one you\u2019ll start filling out in the first half of February. I\u2019ll send out a new one at the end of March to start using in April.\n\u00a0\nLet me know if you need anything else!\n\u00a0\n\u201cSG\u201d Gluckstein\n \n(they/them)\nAccountant\nLCW\nEmail: \naccounting@lcwmail.com\nWebsite\n\u00a0\n|\n\u00a0\nTwitter\n \n|\n\u00a0\nFacebook\n\u00a0\n|\n\u00a0\nLinkedIn\nView our upcoming events\n \n| \nSign-up for our newsletter\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\nFrom:\n Nicole Barile <n.barile@lcwmail.com> \nSent:\n Monday, February 10, 2025 11:25\nTo:\n Jorgelina.venturi@gmail.com\nCc:\n Accounting <accounting@lcwmail.com>\nSubject:\n Banking info & Payments - LCW\n\u00a0\nHello again Jorgelina,\n\u00a0\nI'm copying in SG (our bookkeeper) so they can help with your bank info.\nSG will send you what she needs & will explain our payment process.\u00a0\nI can help jump in when I'm back on Thursday as well.\n\u00a0\nThanks to you both!\nNicole\n\u00a0\nNicole Barile\n\u00a0\n(She/Her)\nChief Operating Officer\nLCW\n\u00a0\nWebsite\n\u00a0\n|\n\u00a0\nTwitter\n\u00a0\n|\n\u00a0\nFacebook\n\u00a0\n|\n\u00a0\nLinkedIn\nView our upcoming events\n\u00a0| \nSign-up for our newsletter",

The invoice looks good. The only adjustment or clarification is for the first US Leading Inclusively date. We discussed rescheduling it and you said on the call that it was not a problem to reschedule the 2/26/2025 session for a later date. I want to confirm that this is still the case once we determine a future date that works with both of you. Currently it says 9/25/2025, which I am guessing is a placeholder in the interim. \n\u00a0\nCould you clarify and confirm?

Or if you prefer, you can send me the routing and account numbers and I\u2019ll input manually.\n\u00a0\nI\u2019m assuming that since you don\u2019t live in the US, you don\u2019t file taxes here? If that\u2019s the case, then all I need is the bank account info. If you are a US taxpayer, I need your form W9.\n\u00a0\nI have attached the Q1 time sheet for you. You\u2019ll submit this twice a month (after the 15\nth\n and after the 1\nst\n) to Nicole for approval (attaching a copy of the file), and pay is processed about the 1\nst\n or 15\nth\n half a month after the sheet is submitted (usually takes a few days to get into the account). Please let me know if you have any questions about how to fill it out, we can always hop on a call. For this one you\u2019ll start filling out in the first half of February. I\u2019ll send out a new one at the end of March to start using in April.\n\u00a0\nLet me know if you need anything else!\n\u00a0\n\u201cSG\u201d Gluckstein\n \n(they/them)\nAccountant\nLCW\nEmail: \naccounting@lcwmail.com\nWebsite\n\u00a0\n|\n\u00a0\nTwitter\n \n|\n\u00a0\nFacebook\n\u00a0\n|\n\u00a0\nLinkedIn\nView our upcoming events\n \n| \nSign-up for our newsletter\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\nFrom:\n Nicole Barile <n.barile@lcwmail.com> \nSent:\n Monday, February 10, 2025 11:25\nTo:\n Jorgelina.venturi@gmail.com\nCc:\n Accounting <accounting@lcwmail.com>\nSubject:\n Banking info & Payments - LCW\n\u00a0\nHello again Jorgelina,\n\u00a0\nI'm copying in SG (our bookkeeper) so they can help with your bank info.\nSG will send you what she needs & will explain our payment process.\u00a0\nI can help jump in when I'm back on Thursday as well.\n\u00a0\nThanks to you both!\nNicole\n\u00a0\nNicole Barile\n\u00a0\n(She/Her)\nChief Operating Officer\nLCW\n\u00a0\nWebsite\n\u00a0\n|\n\u00a0\nTwitter\n\u00a0\n|\n\u00a0\nFacebook\n\u00a0\n|\n\u00a0\nLinkedIn\nView our upcoming events\n\u00a0| \nSign-up for our newsletter",

Sending anyway as it has more info than the other emails I've sent today.\nHi Chuck,\nI'm awaiting confirmation on a few things, but I believe Jorgelina Venturi will start as our new Translation Coordinator next week. She will replace Catalina. Catalina will train her, and I'll have another call with the two of them by next Fri to ensure all is handed off properly.\nI'm copying SG \n@Accounting\n\u00a0as a heads\u00a0up - Jorgelina will get $20/hr. She will be doing about 10-15 hours per week, similar to Catalina. I'll share the expense report/timesheet process with her. She's based in Argentina but has a US bank account. If OK, I will get her bank info & share with you for payment. Anything specific I need to get from her for your purposes?\n@Chuck Adams\n\u00a0- We will need to get Jorgelina an LCW email, access to DropBox, access to Scoro, etc. I can do all of the paperwork & most of the tech stuff, but I will need you to create an email for her. (I can offboard Catalina later - her last day is Feb.14)\nJorgelina's email would be j.venturi@lcwmail.com.\nPlease lmk if either of you has any questions.\nThank you!\nNicole\nNicole Barile\n\u00a0\n(She/Her)\nChief Operating Officer\nLCW\nWebsite\n\u00a0\n|\n\u00a0\nTwitter\n\u00a0\n|\n\u00a0\nFacebook\n\u00a0\n|\n\u00a0\nLinkedIn\nView our upcoming events\n\u00a0| \nSign-up for our newsletter",

The invoice looks good. The only adjustment or clarification is for the first US Leading Inclusively date. We discussed rescheduling it and you said on the call that it was not a problem to reschedule the 2/26/2025 session for a later date. I want to confirm that this is still the case once we determine a future date that works with both of you. Currently it says 9/25/2025, which I am guessing is a placeholder in the interim. \n\u00a0\nCould you clarify and confirm? Afterwards, the invoice should be ready to send to Ariba.\n\u00a0\nBest,\nEvan\nFrom:\n Rebecca Parrilla <\nr.parrilla@lcwmail.com\n> \nSent:\n Thursday, February 6, 2025 1:06 PM\nTo:\n Tarshish, Evan (he/him/his) <\nevan.tarshish@bsci.com\n>; Delgado Carranza, Priscila (she/her/hers) <\nPriscila.DelgadoCarranza@bsci.com\n>\nCc:\n Bird, Shani (she/her/hers) <\nShani.Bird@bsci.com\n>; Juri Mansour <\nj.mansour@lcwmail.com\n>; Accounting <\naccounting@lcwmail.com\n>\nSubject:\n {External} RE: FOR YOUR APPROVAL: Draft invoice for 2025 US/EMEA ARCH sessions\nImportance:\n High\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\nCAUTION\n: This email originated from outside of the organization.

At the end of February, we can reevaluate adding recordings for the remaining four sessions based on the number of replays from BHM. The 2,000 audience size figure was an educated estimate, and we\u2019d appreciate the opportunity to measure replays to provide a more accurate number.\n\u00a0\nWe also understand that the 50% discount was contingent upon purchasing five courses. In good faith, we were hoping you might consider honoring the discount for BHM with the understanding that we plan to purchase the additional four courses once we have a better sense of replay engagement.\n\u00a0\nFor BHM, we\u2019d like to schedule the session for the first week of February and can coordinate specific dates based on mutual availability.\n\u00a0\nLastly, please let us know who your accounting contact is so we can start getting LCW set up with EVED, our payment platform. \n\u00a0\nThank you very much for your consideration. We look forward to hearing your thoughts.\n\u00a0\nJenny\n\u00a0\nFrom: \nChuck Adams <\nc.adams@lcwmail.com\n>\nDate: \nWednesday, December 18, 2024 at 12:44\u202fPM\nTo: \nJenny Jones <\nJenny_Jones@gap.com\n>, Pedro Seminario <\nP.seminario@lcwmail.com\n>\nCc: \nJason Lopez <\nJason_Lopez@gap.com\n>\nSubject: \nRE: [External]LCW & Gap Follow up: Spotlight Previews\n\u00a0\nHi, Jenny and Jason!\n\u00a0\nAttached is the updated statement of work for you to socialize with leadership.

Apologies for the delay. Yesterday got away from me.\n\u00a0\nI appreciate the opportunity to clarify. I should have been more precise. The regular pricing for a recording kept for one year is $10,500 per course for the audience suggested. Given that you folks are purchasing 5 courses and that Tish is a valued partner we can reduce that by 50% for each course, or $5,250 for each recording for access for up to 2,000 learners over 12 months.\n\u00a0\nAlso, your folks can certainly run the session. We will require a tech run through to ensure a seamless experience for learners.\n\u00a0\nWe will write up the session and send you an SOW to react to with the details above.\n\u00a0\nChuck\n\u00a0\nChuck Adams\n \n(He/Him)\nChief Executive Officer\nLCW\nOffice: \n+1.773.938.4285\nMobile: +1.630.373.5068\n\u00a0\nWebsite\n\u00a0\n|\n\u00a0\nTwitter\n \n|\n\u00a0\nFacebook\n\u00a0\n|\n\u00a0\nLinkedIn\nView our upcoming events\n \n| \nSign-up for our newsletter\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\nFrom:\n Jenny Jones <\nJenny_Jones@gap.com\n> \nSent:\n Tuesday, December 17, 2024 1:40 PM\nTo:\n Chuck Adams <\nc.adams@lcwmail.com\n>; Pedro Seminario <\nP.seminario@lcwmail.com\n>\nCc:\n Jason Lopez <\nJason_Lopez@gap.com\n>\nSubject:\n Re: [External]LCW & Gap Follow up: Spotlight Previews\n\u00a0\nThank you, Chuck!\n\u00a0\nCan you please confirm that the incremental $10,500 would be inclusive of all 5 recorded sessions?

Below I\u2019ve outlined a few follow-up questions + notes around what we\u2019d like to explore adding: \n\u00a0\nOption to build in some customization to each workshop. For example, shorten to 45 mins if possible, and ensuring sessions are conducive to a live audience and pre-recorded sessions. \nSure. Customizations start at $750 depending on the level of customization. That covers a lot. \nIs there a list of what it covers?\n \nWe would need to have a detailed conversation around what you need. \nWhat we are most interested in is shortening the sessions to 45 min. Also, this might already be accounted for, but want to make sure the recording is conducive to someone watching the replay (i.e., if there is a 5 min breakout session, the viewer will not have to wait 5 min for the breakout session to take place). \nAbility to have recordings available on our employee intranet for 1 year \nYes. We can do that. Does your platform allow for SCORM files or will you need a simple recording?\n \nWe will need an .mov or .mp4 file\nOn our call you mentioned the price would vary based on audience size. What audience size does the current proposal reflect? \nThe predicted audience size only impacts the cost of the recorded session. We price those like elearnings, based on audience size. If you can remind me of the audience size I can price that out.\n \nThe expected number of replays is 2,000 employees\nWe didn\u2019t discuss this on our call but curious if you have any existing resources available for post-election programming. \nWe are building a course on Civility in Dialog, with the recent political polarization in mind. Simply put, how do we remain civil in what some consider uncivil times. \u00a0And we will soon have a Religious Inclusion course for folks who are feeling left out of conversations around inclusion in the workplace.\n \nThanks for the insight. What is the anticipated availability date for these sessions? \n\u00a0\nLet me know if I can clarify anything and feel free to call me with questions. \n\u00a0\nThanks again!\n\u00a0\nJenny \n\u00a0\n\u00a0\nJENNY JONES\nCommunity Partnerships\u00a0\nEquality & Belonging\n(303) 550-2241\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\nFrom: \nPedro Seminario <\nP.seminario@lcwmail.com\n>\nDate: \nThursday, December 12, 2024 at 2:03\u202fPM\nTo: \nJenny Jones <\nJenny_Jones@gap.com\n>\nCc: \nJason Lopez <\nJason_Lopez@gap.com\n>, Chuck Adams <\nc.adams@lcwmail.com\n>\nSubject: \nRE: [External]LCW & Gap Follow up: Spotlight Previews\n\u00a0\nHi Jenny,\n\u00a0\nGreat timing and thank you for your email.

In good faith, we were hoping you might consider honoring the discount for BHM with the understanding that we plan to purchase the additional four courses once we have a better sense of replay engagement.\n\u00a0\nFor BHM, we\u2019d like to schedule the session for the first week of February and can coordinate specific dates based on mutual availability.\n\u00a0\nLastly, please let us know who your accounting contact is so we can start getting LCW set up with EVED, our payment platform. \n\u00a0\nThank you very much for your consideration.

Below I\u2019ve outlined a few follow-up questions + notes around what we\u2019d like to explore adding: \n\u00a0\nOption to build in some customization to each workshop. For example, shorten to 45 mins if possible, and ensuring sessions are conducive to a live audience and pre-recorded sessions. \nSure. Customizations start at $750 depending on the level of customization. That covers a lot. \nIs there a list of what it covers?\n \nWe would need to have a detailed conversation around what you need. \nWhat we are most interested in is shortening the sessions to 45 min. Also, this might already be accounted for, but want to make sure the recording is conducive to someone watching the replay (i.e., if there is a 5 min breakout session, the viewer will not have to wait 5 min for the breakout session to take place). \nAbility to have recordings available on our employee intranet for 1 year \nYes. We can do that. Does your platform allow for SCORM files or will you need a simple recording?\n \nWe will need an .mov or .mp4 file\nOn our call you mentioned the price would vary based on audience size. What audience size does the current proposal reflect? \nThe predicted audience size only impacts the cost of the recorded session. We price those like elearnings, based on audience size. If you can remind me of the audience size I can price that out.\n \nThe expected number of replays is 2,000 employees\nWe didn\u2019t discuss this on our call but curious if you have any existing resources available for post-election programming. \nWe are building a course on Civility in Dialog, with the recent political polarization in mind.

At the end of February, we can reevaluate adding recordings for the remaining four sessions based on the number of replays from BHM. The 2,000 audience size figure was an educated estimate, and we\u2019d appreciate the opportunity to measure replays to provide a more accurate number.\n\u00a0\nWe also understand that the 50% discount was contingent upon purchasing five courses. In good faith, we were hoping you might consider honoring the discount for BHM with the understanding that we plan to purchase the additional four courses once we have a better sense of replay engagement.\n\u00a0\nFor BHM, we\u2019d like to schedule the session for the first week of February and can coordinate specific dates based on mutual availability.\n\u00a0\nLastly, please let us know who your accounting contact is so we can start getting LCW set up with EVED, our payment platform. \n\u00a0\nThank you very much for your consideration.

Apologies for the delay. Yesterday got away from me.\n\u00a0\nI appreciate the opportunity to clarify. I should have been more precise. The regular pricing for a recording kept for one year is $10,500 per course for the audience suggested. Given that you folks are purchasing 5 courses and that Tish is a valued partner we can reduce that by 50% for each course, or $5,250 for each recording for access for up to 2,000 learners over 12 months.\n\u00a0\nAlso, your folks can certainly run the session. We will require a tech run through to ensure a seamless experience for learners.\n\u00a0\nWe will write up the session and send you an SOW to react to with the details above.\n\u00a0\nChuck\n\u00a0\nChuck Adams\n \n(He/Him)\nChief Executive Officer\nLCW\nOffice: \n+1.773.938.4285\nMobile: +1.630.373.5068\n\u00a0\nWebsite\n\u00a0\n|\n\u00a0\nTwitter\n \n|\n\u00a0\nFacebook\n\u00a0\n|\n\u00a0\nLinkedIn\nView our upcoming events\n \n| \nSign-up for our newsletter\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\nFrom:\n Jenny Jones <\nJenny_Jones@gap.com\n> \nSent:\n Tuesday, December 17, 2024 1:40 PM\nTo:\n Chuck Adams <\nc.adams@lcwmail.com\n>; Pedro Seminario <\nP.seminario@lcwmail.com\n>\nCc:\n Jason Lopez <\nJason_Lopez@gap.com\n>\nSubject:\n Re: [External]LCW & Gap Follow up: Spotlight Previews\n\u00a0\nThank you, Chuck!\n\u00a0\nCan you please confirm that the incremental $10,500 would be inclusive of all 5 recorded sessions? If so, we would love to move forward with getting a contract in place for the 5 sessions with Basic customization and recording replay usage for 1 year (from date of each event). \n\u00a0\nAdditional notes to include in the contract (if you are aligned): \nZoom webinar to be managed by Gap Inc. (i.e., Gap Inc. will host the Zoom webinar and create the recording, with LCW facilitator(s) as panelists, utilizing Gap Inc AV support). \nSession dates to be scheduled within the first week of each Heritage Month with the final date to be aligned on with all parties 30 days prior to event\n\u00a0\nPlease let me know if you are aligned to the above. We would love to finalize the contract this week if possible so we can move forward to invoicing and processing payment by end of January. \n\u00a0\nThanks again, \n\u00a0\nJenny\n\u00a0\nFrom: \nChuck Adams <\nc.adams@lcwmail.com\n>\nDate: \nTuesday, December 17, 2024 at 7:37\u202fAM\nTo: \nJenny Jones <\nJenny_Jones@gap.com\n>, Pedro Seminario <\nP.seminario@lcwmail.com\n>\nCc: \nJason Lopez <\nJason_Lopez@gap.com\n>\nSubject: \nRE: [External]LCW & Gap Follow up: Spotlight Previews\n\u00a0\nThank you, Jenny. \nPlease find the responses below.

Below I\u2019ve outlined a few follow-up questions + notes around what we\u2019d like to explore adding: \n\u00a0\nOption to build in some customization to each workshop. For example, shorten to 45 mins if possible, and ensuring sessions are conducive to a live audience and pre-recorded sessions. \nSure. Customizations start at $750 depending on the level of customization. That covers a lot. \nIs there a list of what it covers?\n \nWe would need to have a detailed conversation around what you need. \nWhat we are most interested in is shortening the sessions to 45 min. Also, this might already be accounted for, but want to make sure the recording is conducive to someone watching the replay (i.e., if there is a 5 min breakout session, the viewer will not have to wait 5 min for the breakout session to take place). \nAbility to have recordings available on our employee intranet for 1 year \nYes. We can do that. Does your platform allow for SCORM files or will you need a simple recording?\n \nWe will need an .mov or .mp4 file\nOn our call you mentioned the price would vary based on audience size. What audience size does the current proposal reflect? \nThe predicted audience size only impacts the cost of the recorded session. We price those like elearnings, based on audience size. If you can remind me of the audience size I can price that out.\n \nThe expected number of replays is 2,000 employees\nWe didn\u2019t discuss this on our call but curious if you have any existing resources available for post-election programming. \nWe are building a course on Civility in Dialog, with the recent political polarization in mind. Simply put, how do we remain civil in what some consider uncivil times. \u00a0And we will soon have a Religious Inclusion course for folks who are feeling left out of conversations around inclusion in the workplace.\n \nThanks for the insight. What is the anticipated availability date for these sessions? \n\u00a0\nLet me know if I can clarify anything and feel free to call me with questions. \n\u00a0\nThanks again!\n\u00a0\nJenny \n\u00a0\n\u00a0\nJENNY JONES\nCommunity Partnerships\u00a0\nEquality & Belonging\n(303) 550-2241\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\nFrom: \nPedro Seminario <\nP.seminario@lcwmail.com\n>\nDate: \nThursday, December 12, 2024 at 2:03\u202fPM\nTo: \nJenny Jones <\nJenny_Jones@gap.com\n>\nCc: \nJason Lopez <\nJason_Lopez@gap.com\n>, Chuck Adams <\nc.adams@lcwmail.com\n>\nSubject: \nRE: [External]LCW & Gap Follow up: Spotlight Previews\n\u00a0\nHi Jenny,\n\u00a0\nGreat timing and thank you for your email.

Payroll is running those corrections to ensure you pay the correct amount to each tax jurisdiction where you're liable for payroll taxes.\nWhen we do reconciliations, we look for variances between what we collected in taxes from your pay runs in the quarter and what the tax agencies expect you to pay. In some cases, we'll find variances between these two amounts. Variances are normal, and can be the result of a number of things.\nHere's a snapshot of where you stand, and what will happen next:\nFor your Full-Service jurisdictions, we will automatically create pay runs in your account and you'll see the following net amount \ncredited to \nyour bank account ending in ******6303 by April 07, 2025 for $0.05 for Unemployment Tax.\nFor additional details, please feel free to review your \nTax Payments report\n from your Payroll app.\nThanks, \nTriNet \nQuestions or concerns?
