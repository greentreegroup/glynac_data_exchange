Since they prepaid half, what I will do is send invoices after the sessions are delivered for half of the total amount, rather than using up the prepayment and then sending full invoices \u2013 spread out the cash flow over the delivery. Does that make sense? If they push back we can change that process but it\u2019s better for us to be sending milestone invoices along the way.\n\u00a0\nI can send Shani a draft invoice for the 3/10 EMEA session (for $4,500) for approval, and then do the same at the end of next month for the next session.

Since they prepaid half, what I will do is send invoices after the sessions are delivered for half of the total amount, rather than using up the prepayment and then sending full invoices \u2013 spread out the cash flow over the delivery. Does that make sense? If they push back we can change that process but it\u2019s better for us to be sending milestone invoices along the way.\n\u00a0\nI can send Shani a draft invoice for the 3/10 EMEA session (for $4,500) for approval, and then do the same at the end of next month for the next session.

We will need to add money (at least $12,000) before 4/5, when I expect the big 401k draft to go out (assuming the scheduling works the way I think it does on their end). It might be good to move that sooner in case it happens differently for the off-cycle run, and if it doesn\u2019t hit that day I\u2019ll keep my eyes open to be sure we have enough to cover it when it comes.
