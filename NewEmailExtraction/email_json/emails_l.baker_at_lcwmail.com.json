Ignoring federal and academic research showing the success of hybrid and remote models, these policies risk damaging public service efficiency and triggering costly turnover\u2014just as seen under Biden\u2019s more moderate RTO approach.\nTo learn more, check out this \nblog\n.\nRead Blog\n \nPrefer video to text? See this \nvideo\n based on the blog:\nIf you prefer audio, listen to this \npodcast\n based on the blog:\nMake Your Voice Heard\nVote in this \nLinkedIn poll\n to contribute to the conversation. I will use the responses to inform my articles in \nHarvard Business Review\n, \nFortune\n, and \nEntrepreneur\n.\nYour Testimonials\nYou and others who gain value from Disaster Avoidance Experts \nservices\n and thought leadership occasionally share testimonials about your experience, such as the one below. You can read more testimonials \nhere\n.\n\"I highly recommend Dr. Gleb coming to your Vistage meeting because it was an outstanding presentation. \nIt was a presentation about really how you think, what kind of questions to ask, how to get through difficult situations.\n And the biggest thing we talk about at Vistage is decisions. After you leave this meeting, you're going to find out better ways of making decisions and the choices you make and the impact that it has on your business, your personal life, and your spiritual life.\"\n-\u200c \nChet Tart\n, Vistage Chair\nSchedule a Free Consultation\n \nWhat's Up With Me\nIt\u2019s a puzzle to me why so many things that appear to be solely data-informed become so politicized.\n Why did WFH grow so politicized, for example? It\u2019s not obvious at all that Republicans should favor government employees working in the office: after all, you can save a lot of money on real estate, as well as on hiring and retention costs, since people are willing to work for less and have better retention when they work remotely at least some of the time. Furthermore, productivity metrics and morale are higher when people can work remotely at least some of the time. But clearly, this issue did become politicized. Is it because of a lack of trust in public workers? Well, you can simply institute more clear accountability and tracking mechanisms, rather than forcing people back to the office, and losing all the benefits. It\u2019s a clear example where culture wars win out over good, common business sense.\u00a0\nWould love to get your feedback on what you found most useful about this edition of the \u201cWise Decision Maker Guide\u201d - simply reply to this email.\nDecisively Yours,\nDr. Gleb\nDr. Gleb Tsipursky\nCEO of Disaster Avoidance Experts\nPS: Are we connected on LinkedIn?

What if\u00a0I get labeled \"difficult\"?\nSo,\u00a0they stay silent. Again.\u00a0Now imagine this happening to employees across your organization, every single day.\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\ud83e\udd14\n The Experience:\u00a0\nFor many employees, especially those from underrepresented backgrounds, this is a daily reality.\nThey \nhold back\n, they \nmask their identity\n, they \nself-censor\n, not because they don\u2019t care\u2026but because the environment has taught them it\u2019s not safe to show up fully.\u00a0\nLeaders like you are doing the work\u2014you\u2019re committed to DEI, you\u2019ve launched initiatives, and built task forces. But without psychological safety, none of it sticks.\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u26a0\ufe0f\n The Problem:\u00a0\nWhen your team doesn\u2019t feel safe to speak up, challenge the status quo, or express themselves authentically, your organization suffers:\u00a0\nInnovation stalls.\u00a0\nEngagement declines.\u00a0\nDiverse talent quietly leaves.\u00a0\nInclusion becomes performative.\u00a0\nLack of psychological safety \nerodes trust\n, and with it, your DEI efforts lose their power. You\u2019re left managing programs that check boxes but don\u2019t change hearts.\n\u00a0\n\ud83d\udca1\n The Future You\u2019re Waiting For:\u00a0\nNow, picture this instead:\u00a0\nA culture where every employee\u2014regardless of role, identity, or background\u2014feels not just seen but \nsafe\n.\nWhere a Black employee challenges a policy without fear.\nWhere a trans team member can correct misgendering confidently.\nWhere junior staff raise bold ideas without worrying they\u2019ll be shut down.\u00a0\nThat\u2019s when DEI becomes more than a program\u2014it becomes \na lived experience\n.\u00a0\nAnd it starts with psychological safety.\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\ud83c\udfa4\n What\u2019s Next:\u00a0\nIn a few days, I\u2019ll be sending you \nPart 2\n, packed with specific, actionable strategies to build psychological safety in your workplace.\u00a0\nBecause inclusion can\u2019t survive without it\u2014and your people can\u2019t thrive without it.\u00a0\n\ud83d\udc49\n Watch your inbox for the next email.

Thanks,\n\u00a0\nLBJ\n\u00a0\nFrom:\n Larry Baker <lbjbaker1@gmail.com> \nSent:\n Sunday, March 30, 2025 10:47 AM\nTo:\n Larry Baker <l.baker@lcwmail.com>\nSubject:\n Examples for Ultieg\n\u00a0\nCross-Generational Developmental Conversations\nScenario 1: Boomer Manager & Gen Z Employee\nContext:\n Marketing department of a retail company \nTopic:\n Communication style and formality \nCharacters:\n Patricia (59, Baby Boomer, Marketing Director) and Tyler (23, Gen Z, Marketing Coordinator)\nConversation:\nPatricia:\n Tyler, I wanted to chat about your communication style in client meetings. I've noticed you tend to use casual language and abbreviations that some of our more traditional clients might not understand.\nTyler:\n Yeah, I get that. I guess I'm just communicating how I normally would. Is it really that big of a deal?\nPatricia:\n In some contexts, it can be. Many of our established clients expect a certain level of formality. It signals professionalism to them.\nTyler:\n That's interesting. I actually find that being authentic and speaking naturally helps me build better connections. My generation values authenticity over formality.\nPatricia:\n I appreciate that perspective. Perhaps we can find a middle ground. Could you consider adjusting your style for certain clients while maintaining your authentic approach with others?\nTyler:\n I could definitely be more mindful of my audience. Maybe you could help me identify which clients might prefer more formal communication?\nPatricia:\n That's a great solution. I'll share my insights about our client preferences, and perhaps you could teach me some of the more effective casual communication techniques that work well with younger clients.\nTyler:\n I'd be happy to! I think we could both learn from each other's strengths here.\nScenario 2: Millennial Manager & Boomer Employee\nContext:\n Financial services firm \nTopic:\n Adapting to technological changes \nCharacters:\n Jessica (38, Millennial, Team Lead) and Robert (62, Baby Boomer, Financial Analyst)\nConversation:\nJessica:\n Robert, I've noticed you're still using the old spreadsheet method for client data analysis rather than the new CRM system we implemented last month.\nRobert:\n The spreadsheet system has worked perfectly fine for the past 15 years. I can get the same results without having to learn an entirely new system.\nJessica:\n I understand you've developed efficient systems over your career. However, the new CRM offers features that significantly speed up analysis and allows for better team collaboration.\nRobert:\n I've built my career on accuracy and thoroughness. I'm concerned that rushing to adopt new technology might compromise that quality.\nJessica:\n I deeply respect your commitment to quality. What if we approach this as an opportunity to combine your analytical expertise with new tools that can enhance what you already do well?\nRobert:\n I suppose I've been resisting because I'm worried about the learning curve. At this stage in my career, starting from scratch feels challenging.\nJessica:\n That's a valid concern. What if I arranged for one-on-one training sessions? Your experience is incredibly valuable to our team, and combining that with new technological capabilities would be powerful.\nRobert:\n I appreciate you recognizing that. I'm willing to give it a try with proper support. Perhaps I could also document some of the analytical approaches I've developed that might be integrated into the new system.\nJessica:\n That would be excellent! Your expertise could help us customize the CRM to better serve our specific needs.\nScenario 3: Gen X Colleagues of Different Racial Backgrounds\nContext:\n University administration \nTopic:\n Inclusive leadership and cultural awareness \nCharacters:\n Marcus (48, Black, Associate Dean) and Diane (45, White, Department Chair)\nConversation:\nMarcus:\n Diane, I wanted to discuss something I observed in yesterday's faculty meeting. When Professor Johnson, who is Korean American, was speaking about her research, she was interrupted several times.\nDiane:\n I noticed that too, but I wasn't sure if I should step in. I sometimes worry about overstepping or making assumptions about what others might need.\nMarcus:\n I understand that concern. As leaders in our department, though, I think we need to be more proactive about ensuring everyone's voice is heard equally.\nDiane:\n You're right. I realize I may have hesitated because I'm sometimes unsure about how to address these moments without making them more awkward. How do you approach these situations?\nMarcus:\n For me, it's about establishing clear meeting norms from the beginning. I've found that simple statements like \"Let's make sure we hear everyone's complete thoughts before responding\" can make a difference.\nDiane:\n That's helpful. I think I also need to become more comfortable with the discomfort that can come with addressing these moments directly.\nMarcus:\n Absolutely. And from my experience as a Black man in academia, I can tell you that the discomfort of having someone interrupt these patterns is far less than the discomfort of being repeatedly interrupted or overlooked.\nDiane:\n That's an important perspective I hadn't fully considered. I'd appreciate your feedback as I work on being more proactive. Maybe we could collaborate on developing some departmental guidelines for inclusive discussions?\nMarcus:\n I'd be happy to work on that together. By combining our different perspectives and experiences, we could create something that really addresses the needs of our diverse faculty.\nScenario 4: Gen Z Manager & Millennial Employee\nContext:\n Tech startup \nTopic:\n Work-life boundaries and productivity \nCharacters:\n Zoe (27, Gen Z, Product Manager) and Miguel (35, Millennial, Software Developer)\nConversation:\nZoe:\n Miguel, I noticed you've been responding to Slack messages at midnight and sending emails on weekends. I'm concerned about potential burnout.\nMiguel:\n I appreciate your concern, but I'm just trying to stay on top of everything. This project is important, and I want to make sure we meet our deadlines.\nZoe:\n I understand the commitment to the project, but our company values sustainable productivity. We don't expect people to be available 24/7.\nMiguel:\n In my previous companies, responsiveness was highly valued. It showed dedication to the job.\nZoe:\n That's interesting. For my generation, we've seen the negative effects of always-on culture. Research shows that proper rest actually improves overall productivity and creativity.\nMiguel:\n I guess I'm still carrying expectations from previous workplace cultures. Sometimes I worry that if I'm not constantly available, it might seem like I'm not committed enough.\nZoe:\n Your commitment is evident in the quality of your work, not in when you respond to messages. What if we establish some team agreements about communication hours?\nMiguel:\n That could help set clearer expectations. To be honest, it would be nice to disconnect more without feeling guilty.\nZoe:\n Exactly. Let's work together to define what healthy boundaries look like for our team. Your experience is valuable, and I want to make sure you're set up for long-term success here, not just short-term output.\nMiguel:\n I appreciate that. It's actually refreshing to have a manager who prioritizes wellbeing alongside performance.\nScenario 5: Gen X Manager & Gen Alpha Intern\nContext:\n Environmental nonprofit \nTopic:\n Professional communication and expectations \nCharacters:\n Lisa (44, Gen X, Program Director) and Aiden (16, Gen Alpha, Summer Intern)\nConversation:\nLisa:\n Aiden, I wanted to check in about your first few weeks with us. How are you finding the experience?\nAiden:\n It's been cool! I really like the mission. But sometimes I'm not sure what I'm supposed to be doing or if I'm doing things right.\nLisa:\n Thanks for sharing that. Could you tell me more about where you're feeling uncertain?\nAiden:\n Well, like yesterday when you asked me to \"circle back\" with the volunteers, I wasn't really sure what that meant. And sometimes I feel like I should be doing more, but I don't want to mess anything up.\nLisa:\n I see. I should be more clear with my instructions and avoid jargon. \"Circling back\" just means following up with them about their availability.\nAiden:\n That makes sense. Also, is it okay to message you with questions? I use messaging apps for everything, but I'm not sure what's professional.\nLisa:\n Great question. For quick clarifications, messaging is perfect. For more complex discussions or anything involving program decisions, I'd prefer we talk in person or schedule a video call.\nAiden:\n Got it. That helps a lot.\nLisa:\n I'm curious - what methods of communication do you find most effective?\nAiden:\n I like how we use different channels for different types of communication here. But maybe having some examples of professional messages would help me understand the expectations better.\nLisa:\n That's an excellent suggestion. I can put together some templates and examples. And Aiden, please know that asking questions is exactly what you should be doing as an intern. It shows engagement and a desire to learn.\nAiden:\n Thanks! I'm really excited to learn how things work in a professional environment. It's pretty different from school.\nLisa:\n That's why internships are so valuable. And I appreciate your digital fluency \u2013 it brings a fresh perspective to our team. Let's set up a quick check-in meeting each week to address any questions and make sure you're getting the most out of this experience.",

This authenticity fosters both professional collaboration and personal connection, challenging the assumption that in-person work is necessary for strong workplace bonds.\nWhile companies argue that physical proximity drives creativity and collaboration, many employees remain resistant, citing better work-life balance, increased productivity, and reduced stress when working remotely. Experts suggest that RTO policies should be task-based, allowing flexibility where possible rather than enforcing blanket mandates.\nDr. Gleb\u2019s Take\nThe data is clear: forcing employees back to the office under the illusion that it strengthens relationships is a leadership failure. Authentic connections aren\u2019t built in conference rooms\u2014they\u2019re built through trust, autonomy, and respect. This study proves that remote work doesn\u2019t weaken relationships; it makes them more human.\nCompanies clinging to outdated in-office models aren\u2019t promoting collaboration\u2014they\u2019re asserting control. The future of work is hybrid, flexible, and results-driven. Businesses that embrace this will thrive. Those that don\u2019t will bleed talent to smarter competitors.\n\u201c\nLocal Heterogeneity in Artificial Intelligence Jobs Over Time and Space\n\u201d (SSRN)\nSummary\nThis study analyzes how AI-related job opportunities have evolved across U.S. counties between 2014 and 2023. While traditional tech hubs like Santa Clara, CA, remain dominant, surprising growth has emerged in suburban and remote-friendly areas such as Maries, MO, and Hughes, SD\u2014particularly in the post-lockdown era.\nKey factors driving AI job adoption include a higher concentration of STEM graduates, a tight labor market, and strong patent activity. Conversely, regions with heavy manufacturing and high employee turnover see slower AI adoption. The findings highlight how AI\u2019s economic benefits are unevenly distributed, emphasizing the role of local education, innovation, and labor market conditions. The paper also suggests that place-based policies could help attract AI talent and investments, reducing regional disparities.\nDr. Gleb\u2019s Take\nThe AI job market isn\u2019t just about Silicon Valley anymore\u2014it\u2019s decentralizing, and fast. This study confirms that suburban and remote-friendly regions are becoming unexpected winners in AI job growth. The message for policymakers is clear: if you want to compete in the AI economy, invest in STEM education and innovation incentives now, and support remote work.\nManufacturing-heavy regions resisting AI adoption and opposing remote work are setting themselves up for long-term economic decline. The future belongs to remote-friendly areas that embrace AI, not just as a tool, but as a driver of regional economic transformation. Place-based policies aren\u2019t optional; they\u2019re a necessity for staying competitive in the AI-driven world.\n\u201c\nWhat\u2019s the Goal of the Goal?\n\u201d (Behavioral Scientist)\nSummary\nThis article explores how focusing on short-term metrics can sometimes undermine an organization\u2019s true mission. It illustrates this with several examples, including a car dealership aggressively pressuring customers for high satisfaction scores\u2014so much so that it turned a positive buying experience into a frustrating ordeal. The dealership\u2019s goal should have been to improve customer satisfaction, but instead, they prioritized gaming the rating system.\nAnother example involves Eurostar\u2019s decision to spend 6 billion GBP to cut travel time between London and Paris by 20 minutes. While this technically met their goal, it ignored the bigger question: was this the best way to improve passenger experience? Alternatives like Wi-Fi or enhanced service could have been cheaper and more effective.\nThe article also discusses a government program to help disabled veterans get student loan forgiveness. Initially, the goal was to increase application rates, but after stepping back and asking \u201cWhat\u2019s the goal of the goal?\u201d officials realized they could eliminate the application process altogether\u2014dramatically improving efficiency and veterans\u2019 financial security.\nUltimately, the piece argues that before pursuing any goal, leaders should ask: \u201cWhat\u2019s the bigger purpose?\u201d This approach can prevent wasted effort and uncover simpler, more impactful solutions.\nDr. Gleb\u2019s Take\nThis article nails a fundamental leadership failure: chasing arbitrary metrics instead of real impact. Too many organizations mistake numbers for progress, blindly optimizing for a flawed target. Whether it\u2019s forcing customers into fake high ratings, spending billions on unnecessary upgrades, or drowning people in bureaucracy, the pattern is the same\u2014losing sight of the actual mission.\nSmart leaders step back and ask, \u201cWhat are we really trying to achieve?\u201d Those who don\u2019t end up wasting resources, frustrating employees, and missing out on better solutions. If your strategy is just hitting numbers instead of delivering real value, you\u2019re not leading\u2014you\u2019re just checking boxes.\nWhat did you think of my take on these articles?

This is your opportunity to reassess whether your current policy truly reflects your workforce \ntoday\n.\n\u00a0\n\ud83d\udce3\n \nStrategy 2: Involve Employees in the Conversation\nInclusion starts with listening. Create safe spaces for employees to share feedback about how current dress code policies affect them.\nConsider launching a brief survey or hosting listening sessions. By involving your teams in policy evolution, you build trust, increase buy-in, and gain insights into diverse dress norms that you may not have considered.\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\ud83d\udcc4\n \nStrategy 3: Define Professionalism with Cultural Flexibility\nYes, professionalism matters\u2014but it doesn\u2019t have to be rigid or monocultural. The key is to develop clear, inclusive dress code guidelines that accommodate religious or cultural attire (e.g., hijabs, turbans, saris, dashikis, etc.) while maintaining appropriateness for the role.\nClarity helps prevent subjective interpretations and ensures consistency across departments.\n\u00a0\n\ud83e\udd1d\n \nStrategy 4: Allow for Individual Accommodation\nMake it known that your organization supports respectful accommodations when needed.\nFor example: Religious head coverings, gender-affirming attire, or cultural garments worn for traditional observance should be welcomed\u2014not penalized. This reinforces a message of respect and dignity for all employees.\n\u00a0\nStrategy 5: Lead by Example with Cultural Competence Training\nEnsure that leaders and managers are equipped with the tools to understand, appreciate, and support cultural differences\u2014including attire.\u00a0\n\u00a0A culturally competent leader sets the tone for inclusion from the top down. \u00a0\n\u00a0\nDress codes may seem small\u2014but they speak volumes. When employees no longer have to choose between authenticity and acceptance, they show up more engaged, more confident, and more committed to your mission.\u00a0\nBy implementing culturally inclusive policies, you send a powerful message: \n\ud83d\udc65\n \nEveryone belongs here\u2014exactly as they are.\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\u00a0\n\ud83d\udcde\n \nLet\u2019s Build This Together\nIf you\u2019re ready to take the next step to create a truly inclusive organization, I\u2019d love to support you.\u00a0\nSchedule a complimentary strategy call\n with me today, and let\u2019s explore how \nMastering Cultural Differences\n can help you lead systemic, lasting change.\n\u00a0\n\ud83d\udcc5\n \nBook Your Free Call Now\n \n\u00a0\n\u00a0\nTogether, we\u2019ll create a workplace where every identity is seen\u2014and every voice is heard.\u00a0\nBye for now,\u00a0\nLuiza\n___________________________________\n\u00a0\nLuiza Dreasher,\u00a0Founder and CEO (she/her/hers)\nMastering Cultural Differences\u00a0\nI work with leaders who want to create a work environment where all employees feel valued and want to stay.\nAt \nMastering Cultural Differences LLC,\n we are committed to helping organizations build inclusive, culturally competent workplaces where every individual feels valued and respected.

    "body": "Hi ,\n\u00a0\nI am just following up on my first email that I sent you a few days ago. As I mentioned, my name is Mostafa Samir, and I am an account manager at Amazon Business.\nI was hoping to share with you how Amazon Business can help you save time and money by creating an Amazon Business account. Many organizations like yours are benefiting from their Amazon Business accounts.

    "body": "Plus: the temptation to pay rent with a credit card. \nMarch 26, 2025 \u00a0\u00b7\u00a0 \nView in browser\n \nThe Insightful Leader\nBY \nKELLOGG INSIGHT\nLeadership advice from the Kellogg School of Management at Northwestern University\nGood morning,\nAny leader worth their salt is always looking for ways to improve. One way to understand where you can improve as a leader\u2014and where your blind spots are\u2014is to ask your team for feedback. This may seem straightforward, but getting good, actionable information requires an environment where your team feels comfortable providing candid feedback.\nThis week, Kellogg professor \nLeigh Thompson\n offers advice on how leaders can do just that.\nHow am I (really) doing?\nRecently, Thompson responded to an all-too-common refrain from business leaders: they think they are encouraging open dialogue around the team\u2019s performance and opportunities to improve their own leadership, but the feedback seems facile.\nYet many leaders \u201csuspect that people are hesitant to share their real thoughts\u2014perhaps out of fear of repercussions or just not wanting to rock the boat,\u201d according to Thompson.\nThere are two inertias that need to be overcome in this situation.\nThe first consists of the leader\u2019s own blind spots. The second is the reluctance of team members to risk offering feedback that may backfire or create tension.\n \nTo that end, Thompson offers tips for leaders to get the conversations going.\nStart by explaining in one-on-one meetings that you are committed to improving as a leader, Thompson says. She further suggests getting specific and actionable in these one-on-ones: \u201cAsk for their advice on specific areas, such as, \u2018How can I best improve my communication, leadership, or team meetings?\u2019 This approach lowers the perceived risk for employees and makes it easier for them to share honest insights.\u201d\nTo get more frequent input, shorten the timeline for these more in-depth conversations. Rather than saddling the annual review process with the additional burden of providing 360-degree feedback, build it into a regular cadence.\n\u201cThis ongoing approach normalizes feedback and makes it an integral part of your leadership journey,\u201d Thompson says.\nRead more at Thompson\u2019s \nDear Professor Substack\n.\n\u201cIf you can\u2019t make [rent] this month, like, what\u2019s the chance you\u2019re not going to make it next month? And then you\u2019re going to pay interest on that?\u201d\n\u2014 \nLulu Wang\n, on \nMarketplace\n, on the temptation to pay rent with a credit card, even if it is the type that offers rewards.\nSee you next week,\nFred Schmalz, business and art editor\nKellogg Insight\nFollow us on \nLinkedIn\n.\nAnd listen to our \npodcasts\n.\nKellogg School of Management\n | \n2211 Campus Drive\n, \nEvanston, IL 60208\n \nUnsubscribe larry@lcwmail.com\n \nUpdate Profile\n | \nConstant Contact Data Notice\n \nSent by \ninsight@kellogg.northwestern.edu",

The Alphabet Workers Union (AWU) set a tech industry precedent by negotiating remote roles and workplace protections for Google Help contractors. In the public sector, the American Federation of Government Employees (AFGE) secured telework rights for Social Security Administration staff until 2029, boosting productivity amid staffing shortages. Globally, unions are addressing surveillance, work-life balance, and career equity in remote work agreements. \nThese efforts signal a shift toward modernized labor activism, ensuring flexibility and protections for employees while strengthening unions' relevance in a digital workforce.\nTo learn more, check out this \nblog\n.\nRead Blog\n \nPrefer video to text?

You can read more testimonials \nhere\n.\n \n\u201cWe had the pleasure of co-hosting a webinar that was presented by Dr. Gleb. This webinar, using hybrid work to improve retention and productivity while cutting costs, was an excellent experience. He presented his research in a thoughtful and engaging way. He engaged with his attendees. He also gave them the opportunity to ask questions and give feedback at the end of the webinar. As a result, \nthe survey feedback that we received following Dr. Gleb's presentation was resoundingly positive\n. If you have the opportunity to work with Dr. Gleb, whether as a presenter or consultant in your organization, I highly recommend it.\u201d\nBrandie Laughner\n, \nPresident of the Virtual Chapter of the Labor and Employment Relations Association\nSchedule a Free Consultation\n \nWhat's Up With Me\nI was recently asked to be an expert witness in the killing of Amaree\u2019ya Henderson, a Black American, by police during a routine traffic stop in Kansas City, Kansas. The police acted aggressively and escalated the situation, Henderson tried to drive away, and was then shot and killed. I was asked to explain the anxiety of Black Americans in response to discrimination and aggression by police, as well as the emotional distress experienced by his girlfriend, who was in the car with him, and his mother, who was on Facetime on the phone during the stop.\u00a0\nI read the report on the incident, and then watched the\n \nbody cam footage\n \nof the police officer doing the shooting, and my response to the body cam footage was, to me, surprisingly strong. I was already outraged by the report, but the body cam took it to another level, from intellectual, rational outrage, to something much more visceral. It gave me much more appreciation for why body cam footage needs to be made public: a picture (or video) is truly worth a thousand words, and grabs hold of you in a way that words don\u2019t. We need to do our utmost to provide police with better training and guidance, and to incentivize municipalities to do so through legal court cases that punish police excessive use of force when police mess up. And we need to get cities to deploy body cam footage widely and release it publicly, when the family of the victim allows, to address abuses.\u00a0\nWould love to get your feedback on what you found most useful about this edition of the \u201cWise Decision Maker Guide\u201d - simply reply to this email.\nDecisively Yours,\nDr. Gleb\n \nDr. Gleb Tsipursky\nCEO of Disaster Avoidance Experts\nPS: Are we connected on LinkedIn?
