As agentic AI develops, we\u2019re uncovering innovative applications in HR.\nAgentic AI \u2014 unlike traditional AI models that passively execute pre-programmed instructions\u2014 is an independent entity that takes initiative, makes autonomous decisions, and dynamically adapts to its environment. It tackles complex tasks much like an administrative assistant, freeing you up to focus on critical actions, like introducing top talent to your hiring managers.\nRead more about embracing the power of agentic AI in my \nlatest blog post\n.\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n \n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n \nCo-CEO and Co-founder\nEightfold AI\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\nThe new world of work\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\nAgentic AI is reshaping work \u2014 automating tasks, creating new ones, and transforming existing roles in subtle and profound ways. We\u2019ve known for a long time that traditional HR processes can\u2019t keep pace with today\u2019s demands, forcing your organization to rewrite its playbook in real time. \nThe demand for dynamic, intelligent, real-time insights is greater than ever. Organizational structures and job architectures are rapidly evolving, a challenge that has been top of mind for me since reading this article from the Wharton School\u2019s Ethan Mollick, \u201c\nReinventing the Organization for GenAI and LLMs\n,\n\u201d and this research paper, \u201c\nThe Algorithm and the Org Chart: How Algorithms Can Conflict with Organizational Structures.\n\u201d\nAmid these changes, there is one consistent: talent intelligence is essential. The right intelligence informing your talent strategy brings clarity to your organization, workforce, and market, helping to bring your data into greater focus and solve for what you otherwise can\u2019t see.\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n \n\u00a0\n\u00a0\nfrom\u00a0Jason Cerrato\nVice President of Talent-centered Transformation, Eightfold AI\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\nWhat\u2019s your problem?\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u201cWe have too many candidates!\u201d\n\u201cWe need more friction in the application process!\u201d\n\u201cWe have a complicated, slow hiring cycle that drives us crazy!\u201d\nI heard TA leaders say all of this and more at a recent conference. And sure, too much, too simple, too slow \u2014 these are problems. \nBut what if we reframe our thinking to see these challenges as advantages to adopt a fresh perspective \u2014 and a little agentic AI?\nYou\u2019ve probably already heard about agentic AI shaking things up in talent acquisition, going way beyond basic chatbots. Unlike those that stick to scripts, AI agents can think, adapt, and make real-time decisions \u2014 almost like an extra team member tackling repetitive work so you can focus on talent strategy and relationships.\nToo many candidates? AI agents can pre-screen and prioritize them instantly. Need more friction? Agents can ask the right questions at the right time to filter the best talent. Hiring process too slow? AI automates the repetitive steps so your team can focus on what really matters \u2014 making the best hiring decisions.\nAI agents aren\u2019t here to replace you. They\u2019re here to turn what seem like problems \u2014 like an overwhelming candidate pool or a slow-moving hiring process \u2014 into opportunities. \nWith AI agents handling the heavy lifting, you can shift from firefighting to strategic hiring and put your attention on the high-impact decisions that truly drive your business forward.\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n \n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\nRead more\n about how agentic AI is shaping the future of recruiting.\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n \n\u00a0\n\u00a0\nfrom\u00a0Rebecca Warren\nDirector of Talent-centered Transformation, Eightfold AI\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\nAgentic AI\u2019s potential to take on daily tasks is growing\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\nRecently, I \nread about\n\u00a0OpenAI's new digital assistant, Operator, which is designed to autonomously perform tasks, including ordering groceries and making online bookings.\nWe can now direct agentic AI to complete a supermarket shop, order a meal for delivery, and book a manicure. And while we\u2019re still in the early stages of seeing what agentic AI can do, it\u2019s showing more advanced potential in routine tasks and, in the near future, is poised to take over more complex tasks with our input, like booking holidays. \nHow agentic AI will be used in HR is no different.

Where employees stay silent, where trust erodes, and where inclusion quietly crumbles behind polished DEI statements.\u00a0\nNow let\u2019s talk about what you can do\u2014starting \ntoday\n\u2014to change that.\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\ud83d\udd0d\n Here\u2019s What Works:\u00a0\nThese five strategies are simple, but transformative. When practiced consistently, they build a foundation where \nevery employee feels seen, safe, and valued.\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\ud83e\uddcf\u200d\u2642\ufe0f\n 1. Listen Loudly\u00a0\nCreate structured opportunities for honest dialogue, like inclusive team check-ins or anonymous feedback channels. \u00a0\nBut more importantly? \nRespond\n. Listening only builds trust when it\u2019s followed by action.\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\ud83e\udd1d\n 2. Model Vulnerability from the Top\u00a0\nEncourage leadership to admit mistakes, ask questions, and share when they don\u2019t know. \u00a0\nWhen leaders show that \nthey\n don\u2019t have to be perfect, it gives others permission to be real, too.\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\ud83d\udee0\n 3. Train for Inclusion, Not Just Diversity\u00a0\nMost organizations train on unconscious bias, but stop there. \u00a0\nWhat\u2019s missing? Training that helps managers create \ninclusive team cultures\n where every voice matters. (This is our specialty at \nMastering Cultural Differences\n.)\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\ud83d\udee1\n 4. Recognize and Address Microaggressions\u00a0\nCreate a process that empowers employees to report harmful behaviors without fear. Then train your team on how to respond\u2014not defensively, but with curiosity and accountability.\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\ud83d\udd04\n 5. Reward Psychological Safety Behaviors\u00a0\nCelebrate when someone challenges an idea respectfully. Highlight when a team leader takes feedback with grace. Normalize the behaviors you want to see\u2014because what gets praised, gets repeated.\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\ud83d\udcac\n Let\u2019s Talk About What This Looks Like in \nYour\n Organization\u00a0\nYou\u2019re already committed to DEI.\nYou care deeply about your people.\nNow it\u2019s time to take the next step and make your culture truly inclusive from the inside out.\u00a0\n\ud83d\udd17\n \nSchedule a complimentary call with me\n to explore how we can create real, lasting psychological safety in your workplace\u2014together.\u00a0\n\u00a0\nYou don\u2019t have to do this alone. Let\u2019s build something extraordinary.\u00a0\nBye for now,\u00a0\nLuiza\n___________________________________\n\u00a0\nLuiza Dreasher,\u00a0Founder and CEO (she/her/hers)\nMastering Cultural Differences\u00a0\nI work with leaders who want to create a work environment where all employees feel valued and want to stay.\nAt \nMastering Cultural Differences LLC,\n we are committed to helping organizations build inclusive, culturally competent workplaces where every individual feels valued and respected.

Denial\nExample scenario:\n A Baby Boomer manager dismisses the work-life balance concerns of Millennial employees as simply \"not having a strong work ethic.\"\nWhat's happening:\n The manager fails to recognize the legitimate cultural differences in how generations view work, instead attributing differences to character flaws. They might say, \"When I was their age, we just worked hard without complaining. These kids today just want everything handed to them.\"\n2. Polarization\nExample scenario:\n Gen Z employees form an informal coalition and openly criticize older colleagues for being \"out of touch\" with technology and social trends.\nWhat's happening:\n The younger employees have created an \"us vs. them\" dynamic, judging the older workers negatively based on generational stereotypes. They might express frustration like, \"The Boomers are holding us back with their outdated ideas\u2014they need to retire already\" (Defense), or conversely, \"The older generation's approach to in-person relationship building is so much more authentic than our digital connections\" (Reversal).\n3. Minimization\nExample scenario:\n \nA Gen X team leader says, \"Age doesn't matter in our workplace\u2014we're all just professionals trying to do our jobs well.\"\nWhat's happening:\n While seemingly inclusive, this perspective masks important generational differences in communication styles, work preferences, and values. The team leader is emphasizing universal qualities (\"we're all professionals\") while unintentionally invalidating the unique perspectives and challenges each generation brings to the workplace.\n4. Acceptance\nExample scenario:\n A Millennial project manager acknowledges that different generations have distinct approaches to collaboration and deliberately creates mixed-generation teams to capitalize on diverse perspectives.\nWhat's happening:\n The manager recognizes that Baby Boomers might prefer scheduled meetings and formal documentation, Gen X values independence and efficiency, and Gen Z excels with digital collaboration tools. Rather than judging these differences, the manager respects them as valid cultural variations and designs team processes that accommodate different styles.\n5. Adaptation\nExample scenario:\n A leadership team composed of multiple generations develops a flexible workplace policy that incorporates elements appealing to all age groups.\nWhat's happening:\n The policy includes structured career paths (appealing to Boomers), autonomous work arrangements (valued by Gen X), purpose-driven projects (important to Millennials), and tech-enabled collaboration with rapid feedback (preferred by Gen Z). Leaders shift their communication styles based on their audience\u2014using more formal channels with older employees and more digital platforms with younger staff\u2014while helping different generations translate for each other.\nIn the Adaptation stage, there might be a mentoring program where older employees share institutional knowledge and younger employees provide reverse mentoring on digital skills, creating a genuinely collaborative multigenerational workplace where differences are leveraged as strengths rather than seen as obstacles.",

    "body": "Tell me what you think about these for the IDI slide.\nIntercultural Development Inventory Stages in Workplace Generational Interactions\nHere are examples of how the five IDI stages might manifest when dealing with different generations in the workplace:\n1. Denial\nExample scenario:\n A Baby Boomer manager dismisses the work-life balance concerns of Millennial employees as simply \"not having a strong work ethic.\"\nWhat's happening:\n The manager fails to recognize the legitimate cultural differences in how generations view work, instead attributing differences to character flaws. They might say, \"When I was their age, we just worked hard without complaining. These kids today just want everything handed to them.\"\n2. Polarization\nExample scenario:\n Gen Z employees form an informal coalition and openly criticize older colleagues for being \"out of touch\" with technology and social trends.\nWhat's happening:\n The younger employees have created an \"us vs. them\" dynamic, judging the older workers negatively based on generational stereotypes. They might express frustration like, \"The Boomers are holding us back with their outdated ideas\u2014they need to retire already\" (Defense), or conversely, \"The older generation's approach to in-person relationship building is so much more authentic than our digital connections\" (Reversal).\n3. Minimization\nExample scenario:\n \nA Gen X team leader says, \"Age doesn't matter in our workplace\u2014we're all just professionals trying to do our jobs well.\"\nWhat's happening:\n While seemingly inclusive, this perspective masks important generational differences in communication styles, work preferences, and values. The team leader is emphasizing universal qualities (\"we're all professionals\") while unintentionally invalidating the unique perspectives and challenges each generation brings to the workplace.\n4. Acceptance\nExample scenario:\n A Millennial project manager acknowledges that different generations have distinct approaches to collaboration and deliberately creates mixed-generation teams to capitalize on diverse perspectives.\nWhat's happening:\n The manager recognizes that Baby Boomers might prefer scheduled meetings and formal documentation, Gen X values independence and efficiency, and Gen Z excels with digital collaboration tools. Rather than judging these differences, the manager respects them as valid cultural variations and designs team processes that accommodate different styles.\n5. Adaptation\nExample scenario:\n A leadership team composed of multiple generations develops a flexible workplace policy that incorporates elements appealing to all age groups.\nWhat's happening:\n The policy includes structured career paths (appealing to Boomers), autonomous work arrangements (valued by Gen X), purpose-driven projects (important to Millennials), and tech-enabled collaboration with rapid feedback (preferred by Gen Z). Leaders shift their communication styles based on their audience\u2014using more formal channels with older employees and more digital platforms with younger staff\u2014while helping different generations translate for each other.\nIn the Adaptation stage, there might be a mentoring program where older employees share institutional knowledge and younger employees provide reverse mentoring on digital skills, creating a genuinely collaborative multigenerational workplace where differences are leveraged as strengths rather than seen as obstacles.",

I've noticed you tend to use casual language and abbreviations that some of our more traditional clients might not understand.\nTyler:\n Yeah, I get that. I guess I'm just communicating how I normally would. Is it really that big of a deal?\nPatricia:\n In some contexts, it can be. Many of our established clients expect a certain level of formality. It signals professionalism to them.\nTyler:\n That's interesting. I actually find that being authentic and speaking naturally helps me build better connections. My generation values authenticity over formality.\nPatricia:\n I appreciate that perspective. Perhaps we can find a middle ground. Could you consider adjusting your style for certain clients while maintaining your authentic approach with others?\nTyler:\n I could definitely be more mindful of my audience. Maybe you could help me identify which clients might prefer more formal communication?\nPatricia:\n That's a great solution. I'll share my insights about our client preferences, and perhaps you could teach me some of the more effective casual communication techniques that work well with younger clients.\nTyler:\n I'd be happy to! I think we could both learn from each other's strengths here.\nScenario 2: Millennial Manager & Boomer Employee\nContext:\n Financial services firm \nTopic:\n Adapting to technological changes \nCharacters:\n Jessica (38, Millennial, Team Lead) and Robert (62, Baby Boomer, Financial Analyst)\nConversation:\nJessica:\n Robert, I've noticed you're still using the old spreadsheet method for client data analysis rather than the new CRM system we implemented last month.\nRobert:\n The spreadsheet system has worked perfectly fine for the past 15 years. I can get the same results without having to learn an entirely new system.\nJessica:\n I understand you've developed efficient systems over your career. However, the new CRM offers features that significantly speed up analysis and allows for better team collaboration.\nRobert:\n I've built my career on accuracy and thoroughness. I'm concerned that rushing to adopt new technology might compromise that quality.\nJessica:\n I deeply respect your commitment to quality. What if we approach this as an opportunity to combine your analytical expertise with new tools that can enhance what you already do well?\nRobert:\n I suppose I've been resisting because I'm worried about the learning curve. At this stage in my career, starting from scratch feels challenging.\nJessica:\n That's a valid concern. What if I arranged for one-on-one training sessions? Your experience is incredibly valuable to our team, and combining that with new technological capabilities would be powerful.\nRobert:\n I appreciate you recognizing that. I'm willing to give it a try with proper support. Perhaps I could also document some of the analytical approaches I've developed that might be integrated into the new system.\nJessica:\n That would be excellent! Your expertise could help us customize the CRM to better serve our specific needs.\nScenario 3: Gen X Colleagues of Different Racial Backgrounds\nContext:\n University administration \nTopic:\n Inclusive leadership and cultural awareness \nCharacters:\n Marcus (48, Black, Associate Dean) and Diane (45, White, Department Chair)\nConversation:\nMarcus:\n Diane, I wanted to discuss something I observed in yesterday's faculty meeting. When Professor Johnson, who is Korean American, was speaking about her research, she was interrupted several times.\nDiane:\n I noticed that too, but I wasn't sure if I should step in. I sometimes worry about overstepping or making assumptions about what others might need.\nMarcus:\n I understand that concern. As leaders in our department, though, I think we need to be more proactive about ensuring everyone's voice is heard equally.\nDiane:\n You're right. I realize I may have hesitated because I'm sometimes unsure about how to address these moments without making them more awkward. How do you approach these situations?\nMarcus:\n For me, it's about establishing clear meeting norms from the beginning. I've found that simple statements like \"Let's make sure we hear everyone's complete thoughts before responding\" can make a difference.\nDiane:\n That's helpful. I think I also need to become more comfortable with the discomfort that can come with addressing these moments directly.\nMarcus:\n Absolutely. And from my experience as a Black man in academia, I can tell you that the discomfort of having someone interrupt these patterns is far less than the discomfort of being repeatedly interrupted or overlooked.\nDiane:\n That's an important perspective I hadn't fully considered. I'd appreciate your feedback as I work on being more proactive. Maybe we could collaborate on developing some departmental guidelines for inclusive discussions?\nMarcus:\n I'd be happy to work on that together. By combining our different perspectives and experiences, we could create something that really addresses the needs of our diverse faculty.\nScenario 4: Gen Z Manager & Millennial Employee\nContext:\n Tech startup \nTopic:\n Work-life boundaries and productivity \nCharacters:\n Zoe (27, Gen Z, Product Manager) and Miguel (35, Millennial, Software Developer)\nConversation:\nZoe:\n Miguel, I noticed you've been responding to Slack messages at midnight and sending emails on weekends. I'm concerned about potential burnout.\nMiguel:\n I appreciate your concern, but I'm just trying to stay on top of everything. This project is important, and I want to make sure we meet our deadlines.\nZoe:\n I understand the commitment to the project, but our company values sustainable productivity. We don't expect people to be available 24/7.\nMiguel:\n In my previous companies, responsiveness was highly valued. It showed dedication to the job.\nZoe:\n That's interesting. For my generation, we've seen the negative effects of always-on culture. Research shows that proper rest actually improves overall productivity and creativity.\nMiguel:\n I guess I'm still carrying expectations from previous workplace cultures. Sometimes I worry that if I'm not constantly available, it might seem like I'm not committed enough.\nZoe:\n Your commitment is evident in the quality of your work, not in when you respond to messages. What if we establish some team agreements about communication hours?\nMiguel:\n That could help set clearer expectations. To be honest, it would be nice to disconnect more without feeling guilty.\nZoe:\n Exactly. Let's work together to define what healthy boundaries look like for our team. Your experience is valuable, and I want to make sure you're set up for long-term success here, not just short-term output.\nMiguel:\n I appreciate that. It's actually refreshing to have a manager who prioritizes wellbeing alongside performance.\nScenario 5: Gen X Manager & Gen Alpha Intern\nContext:\n Environmental nonprofit \nTopic:\n Professional communication and expectations \nCharacters:\n Lisa (44, Gen X, Program Director) and Aiden (16, Gen Alpha, Summer Intern)\nConversation:\nLisa:\n Aiden, I wanted to check in about your first few weeks with us. How are you finding the experience?\nAiden:\n It's been cool! I really like the mission. But sometimes I'm not sure what I'm supposed to be doing or if I'm doing things right.\nLisa:\n Thanks for sharing that. Could you tell me more about where you're feeling uncertain?\nAiden:\n Well, like yesterday when you asked me to \"circle back\" with the volunteers, I wasn't really sure what that meant. And sometimes I feel like I should be doing more, but I don't want to mess anything up.\nLisa:\n I see. I should be more clear with my instructions and avoid jargon. \"Circling back\" just means following up with them about their availability.\nAiden:\n That makes sense. Also, is it okay to message you with questions? I use messaging apps for everything, but I'm not sure what's professional.\nLisa:\n Great question. For quick clarifications, messaging is perfect. For more complex discussions or anything involving program decisions, I'd prefer we talk in person or schedule a video call.\nAiden:\n Got it. That helps a lot.\nLisa:\n I'm curious - what methods of communication do you find most effective?\nAiden:\n I like how we use different channels for different types of communication here. But maybe having some examples of professional messages would help me understand the expectations better.\nLisa:\n That's an excellent suggestion. I can put together some templates and examples. And Aiden, please know that asking questions is exactly what you should be doing as an intern. It shows engagement and a desire to learn.\nAiden:\n Thanks! I'm really excited to learn how things work in a professional environment. It's pretty different from school.\nLisa:\n That's why internships are so valuable. And I appreciate your digital fluency \u2013 it brings a fresh perspective to our team. Let's set up a quick check-in meeting each week to address any questions and make sure you're getting the most out of this experience.",

To be honest, it would be nice to disconnect more without feeling guilty.\nZoe:\n Exactly. Let's work together to define what healthy boundaries look like for our team. Your experience is valuable, and I want to make sure you're set up for long-term success here, not just short-term output.\nMiguel:\n I appreciate that. It's actually refreshing to have a manager who prioritizes wellbeing alongside performance.\nScenario 5: Gen X Manager & Gen Alpha Intern\nContext:\n Environmental nonprofit \nTopic:\n Professional communication and expectations \nCharacters:\n Lisa (44, Gen X, Program Director) and Aiden (16, Gen Alpha, Summer Intern)\nConversation:\nLisa:\n Aiden, I wanted to check in about your first few weeks with us. How are you finding the experience?\nAiden:\n It's been cool! I really like the mission. But sometimes I'm not sure what I'm supposed to be doing or if I'm doing things right.\nLisa:\n Thanks for sharing that. Could you tell me more about where you're feeling uncertain?\nAiden:\n Well, like yesterday when you asked me to \"circle back\" with the volunteers, I wasn't really sure what that meant. And sometimes I feel like I should be doing more, but I don't want to mess anything up.\nLisa:\n I see. I should be more clear with my instructions and avoid jargon. \"Circling back\" just means following up with them about their availability.\nAiden:\n That makes sense. Also, is it okay to message you with questions? I use messaging apps for everything, but I'm not sure what's professional.\nLisa:\n Great question. For quick clarifications, messaging is perfect. For more complex discussions or anything involving program decisions, I'd prefer we talk in person or schedule a video call.\nAiden:\n Got it. That helps a lot.\nLisa:\n I'm curious - what methods of communication do you find most effective?\nAiden:\n I like how we use different channels for different types of communication here. But maybe having some examples of professional messages would help me understand the expectations better.\nLisa:\n That's an excellent suggestion. I can put together some templates and examples. And Aiden, please know that asking questions is exactly what you should be doing as an intern. It shows engagement and a desire to learn.\nAiden:\n Thanks! I'm really excited to learn how things work in a professional environment. It's pretty different from school.\nLisa:\n That's why internships are so valuable. And I appreciate your digital fluency \u2013 it brings a fresh perspective to our team. Let's set up a quick check-in meeting each week to address any questions and make sure you're getting the most out of this experience.",

However, it's important to acknowledge that a significant majority of leaders remain committed to advancing inclusion, albeit with increased strategic consideration.\nTo ensure the continued effectiveness and legal defensibility of our DEI programs, we are focusing on:\nLegal Compliance:\n Rigorously auditing our initiatives using established frameworks to mitigate potential legal risks.\nRisk Analysis:\n Evaluating the potential consequences of pausing DEI efforts, including impacts on employee engagement, innovation, and legal standing.\nInternal Communication:\n Reaffirming our commitment to DEI as a core business imperative and cultural value within our organization.\n\u200b\nRead more in my Forbes article here\n.\n \nThanks allies,\nJulie\n\u200b\n\ud83d\udcac \nAllyship Conversation Starters & Resources\n\u200b\nHow to Build Career Resilience in Uncertain Times\n\u200b\n\u200b\n\u200b\n\u200b\n \n\u200b\nBeyond DEI: Understanding Public Opinion on Diversity, Equity, & Inclusion\n\u200b\n\u200b\n\u200b\n \nCare about inclusion for the little ones in your life?

    "body": "Plus: why small firms pass up valuable opportunities. \nApril 2, 2025 \u00a0\u00b7\u00a0 \nView in browser\n \nThe Insightful Leader\nBY \nKELLOGG INSIGHT\nLeadership advice from the Kellogg School of Management at Northwestern University\nGood morning,\nThe transition from individual contributor to first-time manager is a notoriously bumpy ride that requires you to use a muscle you (probably) weren\u2019t trained to flex: helping others grow.\nThis week, \nHarry Kraemer\n, a clinical professor of management and organizations at Kellogg and former chairman and CEO of Baxter International, shares tips to help fledgling leaders stick the landing. \nPlus, what makes small businesses hesitant to take advantage of simple opportunities to improve their bottom line? \nA more-successful transition into management\nIn his 40 years in business, Kraemer\u2019s seen new leaders fall into some of the same traps: they micromanage instead of delegating because they\u2019re more comfortable doing everything themselves, for example. And they\u2019re often so focused on being seen as \u201cirreplaceable\u201d that they end up overshadowing their teams. Unfortunately, Kraemer writes, someone who is irreplaceable in a role is not likely to be promoted out of it.\nKraemer writes that the struggles of first-time managers should be a wake-up call for more-experienced leaders to step up and support them. He offers several tips to that end.\n \nFirst, be a values-based leader, which means constantly reflecting on what matters most so that you can have a positive impact on others. Kraemer\u2019s approach to values-based leadership is anchored in four principles: self-reflection, a balanced perspective, true self-confidence, and genuine humility. \nSelf-reflection is particularly important because it can help you better understand your own priorities and what matters most to you. \n\u201cIf you are not self-reflective, how can you know yourself; and if you do not know yourself, how can you lead yourself? And if you cannot lead yourself, how can you possibly lead others?\u201d Kraemer writes.\nAnother tip for aspiring leaders is to understand that you don\u2019t\u2014and can\u2019t\u2014know everything. Gathering input can provide you with a more balanced perspective and help you correct for blindspots. \n\u201cThis applies to gathering input from others on the best way to tackle a project, as well as to engage with people who hold different and contradictory views, especially in today\u2019s \npolarized world\n,\u201d Kramer writes. \nRead more from Kraemer in \nForbes\n.\nWhy small firms pass up valuable opportunities\nSean Higgins\n's recent research grew out of a surprising observation: small businesses don\u2019t always take advantage of simple opportunities to improve their bottom line.\nHiggins, a Kellogg associate professor of finance, was consulting with a Mexico-based fintech company that charged merchants a fee for credit-card-payment processing. When a competitor had begun offering a lower fee, the fintech company wanted to test lowering its own fee as well. \n\u201cThe idea was to shift some customers to card payments by making those payments cheap enough to offset the indirect costs of using cash, like having to handle it and go to the bank frequently,\u201d Higgins says.\nBut when he helped the company run a pilot study that offered the lower fee to about 11,000 merchants, only about 15 percent opted in. \nThe result motivated Higgins and collaborators Paul Gertler and Ulrike Malmendier of UC Berkeley and Waldo Ojeda of Columbia to study why small businesses hesitate to act. They designed an experiment to test whether behavioral frictions (such as forgetfulness or failing to think long term) could explain why businesses were resistant to taking certain actions that might benefit them. \nThey found that several tools significantly increased customers\u2019 likelihood of accepting the offer. Above all, \u201cpre-announced reminders had the largest impact,\u201d Higgins says.\n\u201cIt has something to do with the fintech company telling merchants on day one that the company is going to do something,\u201d he says, \u201cand then following through and actually doing it.\u201d\nRead more about the research in \nKellogg Insight\n.\n\u201cSince many banking services can be provided online, this will be disproportionately costly to those that have a harder time accessing or using online banking, relative to physical locations, such as the elderly or low-income households.\u201d\n\u2014 \nCarola Frydman\n, in \nNewsweek\n, on what the projected closure of hundreds of U.S. bank branches this year means for Americans.\nSee you next week,\nLaura Pavin, multimedia editor\nKellogg Insight\nFollow us on \nLinkedIn\n.\nAnd listen to our \npodcasts\n.\nKellogg School of Management\n | \n2211 Campus Drive\n, \nEvanston, IL 60208\n \nUnsubscribe larry@lcwmail.com\n \nUpdate Profile\n | \nConstant Contact Data Notice\n \nSent by \ninsight@kellogg.northwestern.edu",

Ignoring federal and academic research showing the success of hybrid and remote models, these policies risk damaging public service efficiency and triggering costly turnover\u2014just as seen under Biden\u2019s more moderate RTO approach.\nTo learn more, check out this \nblog\n.\nRead Blog\n \nPrefer video to text? See this \nvideo\n based on the blog:\nIf you prefer audio, listen to this \npodcast\n based on the blog:\nMake Your Voice Heard\nVote in this \nLinkedIn poll\n to contribute to the conversation. I will use the responses to inform my articles in \nHarvard Business Review\n, \nFortune\n, and \nEntrepreneur\n.\nYour Testimonials\nYou and others who gain value from Disaster Avoidance Experts \nservices\n and thought leadership occasionally share testimonials about your experience, such as the one below. You can read more testimonials \nhere\n.\n\"I highly recommend Dr. Gleb coming to your Vistage meeting because it was an outstanding presentation. \nIt was a presentation about really how you think, what kind of questions to ask, how to get through difficult situations.\n And the biggest thing we talk about at Vistage is decisions. After you leave this meeting, you're going to find out better ways of making decisions and the choices you make and the impact that it has on your business, your personal life, and your spiritual life.\"\n-\u200c \nChet Tart\n, Vistage Chair\nSchedule a Free Consultation\n \nWhat's Up With Me\nIt\u2019s a puzzle to me why so many things that appear to be solely data-informed become so politicized.\n Why did WFH grow so politicized, for example? It\u2019s not obvious at all that Republicans should favor government employees working in the office: after all, you can save a lot of money on real estate, as well as on hiring and retention costs, since people are willing to work for less and have better retention when they work remotely at least some of the time. Furthermore, productivity metrics and morale are higher when people can work remotely at least some of the time. But clearly, this issue did become politicized. Is it because of a lack of trust in public workers? Well, you can simply institute more clear accountability and tracking mechanisms, rather than forcing people back to the office, and losing all the benefits. It\u2019s a clear example where culture wars win out over good, common business sense.\u00a0\nWould love to get your feedback on what you found most useful about this edition of the \u201cWise Decision Maker Guide\u201d - simply reply to this email.\nDecisively Yours,\nDr. Gleb\nDr. Gleb Tsipursky\nCEO of Disaster Avoidance Experts\nPS: Are we connected on LinkedIn?

What if\u00a0I get labeled \"difficult\"?\nSo,\u00a0they stay silent. Again.\u00a0Now imagine this happening to employees across your organization, every single day.\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\ud83e\udd14\n The Experience:\u00a0\nFor many employees, especially those from underrepresented backgrounds, this is a daily reality.\nThey \nhold back\n, they \nmask their identity\n, they \nself-censor\n, not because they don\u2019t care\u2026but because the environment has taught them it\u2019s not safe to show up fully.\u00a0\nLeaders like you are doing the work\u2014you\u2019re committed to DEI, you\u2019ve launched initiatives, and built task forces. But without psychological safety, none of it sticks.\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u26a0\ufe0f\n The Problem:\u00a0\nWhen your team doesn\u2019t feel safe to speak up, challenge the status quo, or express themselves authentically, your organization suffers:\u00a0\nInnovation stalls.\u00a0\nEngagement declines.\u00a0\nDiverse talent quietly leaves.\u00a0\nInclusion becomes performative.\u00a0\nLack of psychological safety \nerodes trust\n, and with it, your DEI efforts lose their power. You\u2019re left managing programs that check boxes but don\u2019t change hearts.\n\u00a0\n\ud83d\udca1\n The Future You\u2019re Waiting For:\u00a0\nNow, picture this instead:\u00a0\nA culture where every employee\u2014regardless of role, identity, or background\u2014feels not just seen but \nsafe\n.\nWhere a Black employee challenges a policy without fear.\nWhere a trans team member can correct misgendering confidently.\nWhere junior staff raise bold ideas without worrying they\u2019ll be shut down.\u00a0\nThat\u2019s when DEI becomes more than a program\u2014it becomes \na lived experience\n.\u00a0\nAnd it starts with psychological safety.\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\ud83c\udfa4\n What\u2019s Next:\u00a0\nIn a few days, I\u2019ll be sending you \nPart 2\n, packed with specific, actionable strategies to build psychological safety in your workplace.\u00a0\nBecause inclusion can\u2019t survive without it\u2014and your people can\u2019t thrive without it.\u00a0\n\ud83d\udc49\n Watch your inbox for the next email.

Thanks,\n\u00a0\nLBJ\n\u00a0\nFrom:\n Larry Baker <lbjbaker1@gmail.com> \nSent:\n Sunday, March 30, 2025 10:47 AM\nTo:\n Larry Baker <l.baker@lcwmail.com>\nSubject:\n Examples for Ultieg\n\u00a0\nCross-Generational Developmental Conversations\nScenario 1: Boomer Manager & Gen Z Employee\nContext:\n Marketing department of a retail company \nTopic:\n Communication style and formality \nCharacters:\n Patricia (59, Baby Boomer, Marketing Director) and Tyler (23, Gen Z, Marketing Coordinator)\nConversation:\nPatricia:\n Tyler, I wanted to chat about your communication style in client meetings. I've noticed you tend to use casual language and abbreviations that some of our more traditional clients might not understand.\nTyler:\n Yeah, I get that. I guess I'm just communicating how I normally would. Is it really that big of a deal?\nPatricia:\n In some contexts, it can be. Many of our established clients expect a certain level of formality. It signals professionalism to them.\nTyler:\n That's interesting. I actually find that being authentic and speaking naturally helps me build better connections. My generation values authenticity over formality.\nPatricia:\n I appreciate that perspective. Perhaps we can find a middle ground. Could you consider adjusting your style for certain clients while maintaining your authentic approach with others?\nTyler:\n I could definitely be more mindful of my audience. Maybe you could help me identify which clients might prefer more formal communication?\nPatricia:\n That's a great solution. I'll share my insights about our client preferences, and perhaps you could teach me some of the more effective casual communication techniques that work well with younger clients.\nTyler:\n I'd be happy to! I think we could both learn from each other's strengths here.\nScenario 2: Millennial Manager & Boomer Employee\nContext:\n Financial services firm \nTopic:\n Adapting to technological changes \nCharacters:\n Jessica (38, Millennial, Team Lead) and Robert (62, Baby Boomer, Financial Analyst)\nConversation:\nJessica:\n Robert, I've noticed you're still using the old spreadsheet method for client data analysis rather than the new CRM system we implemented last month.\nRobert:\n The spreadsheet system has worked perfectly fine for the past 15 years. I can get the same results without having to learn an entirely new system.\nJessica:\n I understand you've developed efficient systems over your career. However, the new CRM offers features that significantly speed up analysis and allows for better team collaboration.\nRobert:\n I've built my career on accuracy and thoroughness. I'm concerned that rushing to adopt new technology might compromise that quality.\nJessica:\n I deeply respect your commitment to quality. What if we approach this as an opportunity to combine your analytical expertise with new tools that can enhance what you already do well?\nRobert:\n I suppose I've been resisting because I'm worried about the learning curve. At this stage in my career, starting from scratch feels challenging.\nJessica:\n That's a valid concern. What if I arranged for one-on-one training sessions? Your experience is incredibly valuable to our team, and combining that with new technological capabilities would be powerful.\nRobert:\n I appreciate you recognizing that. I'm willing to give it a try with proper support. Perhaps I could also document some of the analytical approaches I've developed that might be integrated into the new system.\nJessica:\n That would be excellent! Your expertise could help us customize the CRM to better serve our specific needs.\nScenario 3: Gen X Colleagues of Different Racial Backgrounds\nContext:\n University administration \nTopic:\n Inclusive leadership and cultural awareness \nCharacters:\n Marcus (48, Black, Associate Dean) and Diane (45, White, Department Chair)\nConversation:\nMarcus:\n Diane, I wanted to discuss something I observed in yesterday's faculty meeting. When Professor Johnson, who is Korean American, was speaking about her research, she was interrupted several times.\nDiane:\n I noticed that too, but I wasn't sure if I should step in. I sometimes worry about overstepping or making assumptions about what others might need.\nMarcus:\n I understand that concern. As leaders in our department, though, I think we need to be more proactive about ensuring everyone's voice is heard equally.\nDiane:\n You're right. I realize I may have hesitated because I'm sometimes unsure about how to address these moments without making them more awkward. How do you approach these situations?\nMarcus:\n For me, it's about establishing clear meeting norms from the beginning. I've found that simple statements like \"Let's make sure we hear everyone's complete thoughts before responding\" can make a difference.\nDiane:\n That's helpful. I think I also need to become more comfortable with the discomfort that can come with addressing these moments directly.\nMarcus:\n Absolutely. And from my experience as a Black man in academia, I can tell you that the discomfort of having someone interrupt these patterns is far less than the discomfort of being repeatedly interrupted or overlooked.\nDiane:\n That's an important perspective I hadn't fully considered. I'd appreciate your feedback as I work on being more proactive. Maybe we could collaborate on developing some departmental guidelines for inclusive discussions?\nMarcus:\n I'd be happy to work on that together. By combining our different perspectives and experiences, we could create something that really addresses the needs of our diverse faculty.\nScenario 4: Gen Z Manager & Millennial Employee\nContext:\n Tech startup \nTopic:\n Work-life boundaries and productivity \nCharacters:\n Zoe (27, Gen Z, Product Manager) and Miguel (35, Millennial, Software Developer)\nConversation:\nZoe:\n Miguel, I noticed you've been responding to Slack messages at midnight and sending emails on weekends. I'm concerned about potential burnout.\nMiguel:\n I appreciate your concern, but I'm just trying to stay on top of everything. This project is important, and I want to make sure we meet our deadlines.\nZoe:\n I understand the commitment to the project, but our company values sustainable productivity. We don't expect people to be available 24/7.\nMiguel:\n In my previous companies, responsiveness was highly valued. It showed dedication to the job.\nZoe:\n That's interesting. For my generation, we've seen the negative effects of always-on culture. Research shows that proper rest actually improves overall productivity and creativity.\nMiguel:\n I guess I'm still carrying expectations from previous workplace cultures. Sometimes I worry that if I'm not constantly available, it might seem like I'm not committed enough.\nZoe:\n Your commitment is evident in the quality of your work, not in when you respond to messages. What if we establish some team agreements about communication hours?\nMiguel:\n That could help set clearer expectations. To be honest, it would be nice to disconnect more without feeling guilty.\nZoe:\n Exactly. Let's work together to define what healthy boundaries look like for our team. Your experience is valuable, and I want to make sure you're set up for long-term success here, not just short-term output.\nMiguel:\n I appreciate that. It's actually refreshing to have a manager who prioritizes wellbeing alongside performance.\nScenario 5: Gen X Manager & Gen Alpha Intern\nContext:\n Environmental nonprofit \nTopic:\n Professional communication and expectations \nCharacters:\n Lisa (44, Gen X, Program Director) and Aiden (16, Gen Alpha, Summer Intern)\nConversation:\nLisa:\n Aiden, I wanted to check in about your first few weeks with us. How are you finding the experience?\nAiden:\n It's been cool! I really like the mission. But sometimes I'm not sure what I'm supposed to be doing or if I'm doing things right.\nLisa:\n Thanks for sharing that. Could you tell me more about where you're feeling uncertain?\nAiden:\n Well, like yesterday when you asked me to \"circle back\" with the volunteers, I wasn't really sure what that meant. And sometimes I feel like I should be doing more, but I don't want to mess anything up.\nLisa:\n I see. I should be more clear with my instructions and avoid jargon. \"Circling back\" just means following up with them about their availability.\nAiden:\n That makes sense. Also, is it okay to message you with questions? I use messaging apps for everything, but I'm not sure what's professional.\nLisa:\n Great question. For quick clarifications, messaging is perfect. For more complex discussions or anything involving program decisions, I'd prefer we talk in person or schedule a video call.\nAiden:\n Got it. That helps a lot.\nLisa:\n I'm curious - what methods of communication do you find most effective?\nAiden:\n I like how we use different channels for different types of communication here. But maybe having some examples of professional messages would help me understand the expectations better.\nLisa:\n That's an excellent suggestion. I can put together some templates and examples. And Aiden, please know that asking questions is exactly what you should be doing as an intern. It shows engagement and a desire to learn.\nAiden:\n Thanks! I'm really excited to learn how things work in a professional environment. It's pretty different from school.\nLisa:\n That's why internships are so valuable. And I appreciate your digital fluency \u2013 it brings a fresh perspective to our team. Let's set up a quick check-in meeting each week to address any questions and make sure you're getting the most out of this experience.",

This authenticity fosters both professional collaboration and personal connection, challenging the assumption that in-person work is necessary for strong workplace bonds.\nWhile companies argue that physical proximity drives creativity and collaboration, many employees remain resistant, citing better work-life balance, increased productivity, and reduced stress when working remotely. Experts suggest that RTO policies should be task-based, allowing flexibility where possible rather than enforcing blanket mandates.\nDr. Gleb\u2019s Take\nThe data is clear: forcing employees back to the office under the illusion that it strengthens relationships is a leadership failure. Authentic connections aren\u2019t built in conference rooms\u2014they\u2019re built through trust, autonomy, and respect. This study proves that remote work doesn\u2019t weaken relationships; it makes them more human.\nCompanies clinging to outdated in-office models aren\u2019t promoting collaboration\u2014they\u2019re asserting control. The future of work is hybrid, flexible, and results-driven. Businesses that embrace this will thrive. Those that don\u2019t will bleed talent to smarter competitors.\n\u201c\nLocal Heterogeneity in Artificial Intelligence Jobs Over Time and Space\n\u201d (SSRN)\nSummary\nThis study analyzes how AI-related job opportunities have evolved across U.S. counties between 2014 and 2023. While traditional tech hubs like Santa Clara, CA, remain dominant, surprising growth has emerged in suburban and remote-friendly areas such as Maries, MO, and Hughes, SD\u2014particularly in the post-lockdown era.\nKey factors driving AI job adoption include a higher concentration of STEM graduates, a tight labor market, and strong patent activity. Conversely, regions with heavy manufacturing and high employee turnover see slower AI adoption. The findings highlight how AI\u2019s economic benefits are unevenly distributed, emphasizing the role of local education, innovation, and labor market conditions. The paper also suggests that place-based policies could help attract AI talent and investments, reducing regional disparities.\nDr. Gleb\u2019s Take\nThe AI job market isn\u2019t just about Silicon Valley anymore\u2014it\u2019s decentralizing, and fast. This study confirms that suburban and remote-friendly regions are becoming unexpected winners in AI job growth. The message for policymakers is clear: if you want to compete in the AI economy, invest in STEM education and innovation incentives now, and support remote work.\nManufacturing-heavy regions resisting AI adoption and opposing remote work are setting themselves up for long-term economic decline. The future belongs to remote-friendly areas that embrace AI, not just as a tool, but as a driver of regional economic transformation. Place-based policies aren\u2019t optional; they\u2019re a necessity for staying competitive in the AI-driven world.\n\u201c\nWhat\u2019s the Goal of the Goal?\n\u201d (Behavioral Scientist)\nSummary\nThis article explores how focusing on short-term metrics can sometimes undermine an organization\u2019s true mission. It illustrates this with several examples, including a car dealership aggressively pressuring customers for high satisfaction scores\u2014so much so that it turned a positive buying experience into a frustrating ordeal. The dealership\u2019s goal should have been to improve customer satisfaction, but instead, they prioritized gaming the rating system.\nAnother example involves Eurostar\u2019s decision to spend 6 billion GBP to cut travel time between London and Paris by 20 minutes. While this technically met their goal, it ignored the bigger question: was this the best way to improve passenger experience? Alternatives like Wi-Fi or enhanced service could have been cheaper and more effective.\nThe article also discusses a government program to help disabled veterans get student loan forgiveness. Initially, the goal was to increase application rates, but after stepping back and asking \u201cWhat\u2019s the goal of the goal?\u201d officials realized they could eliminate the application process altogether\u2014dramatically improving efficiency and veterans\u2019 financial security.\nUltimately, the piece argues that before pursuing any goal, leaders should ask: \u201cWhat\u2019s the bigger purpose?\u201d This approach can prevent wasted effort and uncover simpler, more impactful solutions.\nDr. Gleb\u2019s Take\nThis article nails a fundamental leadership failure: chasing arbitrary metrics instead of real impact. Too many organizations mistake numbers for progress, blindly optimizing for a flawed target. Whether it\u2019s forcing customers into fake high ratings, spending billions on unnecessary upgrades, or drowning people in bureaucracy, the pattern is the same\u2014losing sight of the actual mission.\nSmart leaders step back and ask, \u201cWhat are we really trying to achieve?\u201d Those who don\u2019t end up wasting resources, frustrating employees, and missing out on better solutions. If your strategy is just hitting numbers instead of delivering real value, you\u2019re not leading\u2014you\u2019re just checking boxes.\nWhat did you think of my take on these articles?

This is your opportunity to reassess whether your current policy truly reflects your workforce \ntoday\n.\n\u00a0\n\ud83d\udce3\n \nStrategy 2: Involve Employees in the Conversation\nInclusion starts with listening. Create safe spaces for employees to share feedback about how current dress code policies affect them.\nConsider launching a brief survey or hosting listening sessions. By involving your teams in policy evolution, you build trust, increase buy-in, and gain insights into diverse dress norms that you may not have considered.\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\ud83d\udcc4\n \nStrategy 3: Define Professionalism with Cultural Flexibility\nYes, professionalism matters\u2014but it doesn\u2019t have to be rigid or monocultural. The key is to develop clear, inclusive dress code guidelines that accommodate religious or cultural attire (e.g., hijabs, turbans, saris, dashikis, etc.) while maintaining appropriateness for the role.\nClarity helps prevent subjective interpretations and ensures consistency across departments.\n\u00a0\n\ud83e\udd1d\n \nStrategy 4: Allow for Individual Accommodation\nMake it known that your organization supports respectful accommodations when needed.\nFor example: Religious head coverings, gender-affirming attire, or cultural garments worn for traditional observance should be welcomed\u2014not penalized. This reinforces a message of respect and dignity for all employees.\n\u00a0\nStrategy 5: Lead by Example with Cultural Competence Training\nEnsure that leaders and managers are equipped with the tools to understand, appreciate, and support cultural differences\u2014including attire.\u00a0\n\u00a0A culturally competent leader sets the tone for inclusion from the top down. \u00a0\n\u00a0\nDress codes may seem small\u2014but they speak volumes. When employees no longer have to choose between authenticity and acceptance, they show up more engaged, more confident, and more committed to your mission.\u00a0\nBy implementing culturally inclusive policies, you send a powerful message: \n\ud83d\udc65\n \nEveryone belongs here\u2014exactly as they are.\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\u00a0\n\ud83d\udcde\n \nLet\u2019s Build This Together\nIf you\u2019re ready to take the next step to create a truly inclusive organization, I\u2019d love to support you.\u00a0\nSchedule a complimentary strategy call\n with me today, and let\u2019s explore how \nMastering Cultural Differences\n can help you lead systemic, lasting change.\n\u00a0\n\ud83d\udcc5\n \nBook Your Free Call Now\n \n\u00a0\n\u00a0\nTogether, we\u2019ll create a workplace where every identity is seen\u2014and every voice is heard.\u00a0\nBye for now,\u00a0\nLuiza\n___________________________________\n\u00a0\nLuiza Dreasher,\u00a0Founder and CEO (she/her/hers)\nMastering Cultural Differences\u00a0\nI work with leaders who want to create a work environment where all employees feel valued and want to stay.\nAt \nMastering Cultural Differences LLC,\n we are committed to helping organizations build inclusive, culturally competent workplaces where every individual feels valued and respected.

    "body": "Hi ,\n\u00a0\nI am just following up on my first email that I sent you a few days ago. As I mentioned, my name is Mostafa Samir, and I am an account manager at Amazon Business.\nI was hoping to share with you how Amazon Business can help you save time and money by creating an Amazon Business account. Many organizations like yours are benefiting from their Amazon Business accounts.

    "body": "Plus: the temptation to pay rent with a credit card. \nMarch 26, 2025 \u00a0\u00b7\u00a0 \nView in browser\n \nThe Insightful Leader\nBY \nKELLOGG INSIGHT\nLeadership advice from the Kellogg School of Management at Northwestern University\nGood morning,\nAny leader worth their salt is always looking for ways to improve. One way to understand where you can improve as a leader\u2014and where your blind spots are\u2014is to ask your team for feedback. This may seem straightforward, but getting good, actionable information requires an environment where your team feels comfortable providing candid feedback.\nThis week, Kellogg professor \nLeigh Thompson\n offers advice on how leaders can do just that.\nHow am I (really) doing?\nRecently, Thompson responded to an all-too-common refrain from business leaders: they think they are encouraging open dialogue around the team\u2019s performance and opportunities to improve their own leadership, but the feedback seems facile.\nYet many leaders \u201csuspect that people are hesitant to share their real thoughts\u2014perhaps out of fear of repercussions or just not wanting to rock the boat,\u201d according to Thompson.\nThere are two inertias that need to be overcome in this situation.\nThe first consists of the leader\u2019s own blind spots. The second is the reluctance of team members to risk offering feedback that may backfire or create tension.\n \nTo that end, Thompson offers tips for leaders to get the conversations going.\nStart by explaining in one-on-one meetings that you are committed to improving as a leader, Thompson says. She further suggests getting specific and actionable in these one-on-ones: \u201cAsk for their advice on specific areas, such as, \u2018How can I best improve my communication, leadership, or team meetings?\u2019 This approach lowers the perceived risk for employees and makes it easier for them to share honest insights.\u201d\nTo get more frequent input, shorten the timeline for these more in-depth conversations. Rather than saddling the annual review process with the additional burden of providing 360-degree feedback, build it into a regular cadence.\n\u201cThis ongoing approach normalizes feedback and makes it an integral part of your leadership journey,\u201d Thompson says.\nRead more at Thompson\u2019s \nDear Professor Substack\n.\n\u201cIf you can\u2019t make [rent] this month, like, what\u2019s the chance you\u2019re not going to make it next month? And then you\u2019re going to pay interest on that?\u201d\n\u2014 \nLulu Wang\n, on \nMarketplace\n, on the temptation to pay rent with a credit card, even if it is the type that offers rewards.\nSee you next week,\nFred Schmalz, business and art editor\nKellogg Insight\nFollow us on \nLinkedIn\n.\nAnd listen to our \npodcasts\n.\nKellogg School of Management\n | \n2211 Campus Drive\n, \nEvanston, IL 60208\n \nUnsubscribe larry@lcwmail.com\n \nUpdate Profile\n | \nConstant Contact Data Notice\n \nSent by \ninsight@kellogg.northwestern.edu",

The Alphabet Workers Union (AWU) set a tech industry precedent by negotiating remote roles and workplace protections for Google Help contractors. In the public sector, the American Federation of Government Employees (AFGE) secured telework rights for Social Security Administration staff until 2029, boosting productivity amid staffing shortages. Globally, unions are addressing surveillance, work-life balance, and career equity in remote work agreements. \nThese efforts signal a shift toward modernized labor activism, ensuring flexibility and protections for employees while strengthening unions' relevance in a digital workforce.\nTo learn more, check out this \nblog\n.\nRead Blog\n \nPrefer video to text?

You can read more testimonials \nhere\n.\n \n\u201cWe had the pleasure of co-hosting a webinar that was presented by Dr. Gleb. This webinar, using hybrid work to improve retention and productivity while cutting costs, was an excellent experience. He presented his research in a thoughtful and engaging way. He engaged with his attendees. He also gave them the opportunity to ask questions and give feedback at the end of the webinar. As a result, \nthe survey feedback that we received following Dr. Gleb's presentation was resoundingly positive\n. If you have the opportunity to work with Dr. Gleb, whether as a presenter or consultant in your organization, I highly recommend it.\u201d\nBrandie Laughner\n, \nPresident of the Virtual Chapter of the Labor and Employment Relations Association\nSchedule a Free Consultation\n \nWhat's Up With Me\nI was recently asked to be an expert witness in the killing of Amaree\u2019ya Henderson, a Black American, by police during a routine traffic stop in Kansas City, Kansas. The police acted aggressively and escalated the situation, Henderson tried to drive away, and was then shot and killed. I was asked to explain the anxiety of Black Americans in response to discrimination and aggression by police, as well as the emotional distress experienced by his girlfriend, who was in the car with him, and his mother, who was on Facetime on the phone during the stop.\u00a0\nI read the report on the incident, and then watched the\n \nbody cam footage\n \nof the police officer doing the shooting, and my response to the body cam footage was, to me, surprisingly strong. I was already outraged by the report, but the body cam took it to another level, from intellectual, rational outrage, to something much more visceral. It gave me much more appreciation for why body cam footage needs to be made public: a picture (or video) is truly worth a thousand words, and grabs hold of you in a way that words don\u2019t. We need to do our utmost to provide police with better training and guidance, and to incentivize municipalities to do so through legal court cases that punish police excessive use of force when police mess up. And we need to get cities to deploy body cam footage widely and release it publicly, when the family of the victim allows, to address abuses.\u00a0\nWould love to get your feedback on what you found most useful about this edition of the \u201cWise Decision Maker Guide\u201d - simply reply to this email.\nDecisively Yours,\nDr. Gleb\n \nDr. Gleb Tsipursky\nCEO of Disaster Avoidance Experts\nPS: Are we connected on LinkedIn?

From facilitating virtual discussions about the Executive Orders, to providing peer support to dozens of members navigating the legal and political environment while holding the line for the power of DEI, to creating a brave space for practitioners to open up and support one another during this challenging time...the DEI Alliance has been full of energy and opportunity for those members who have tapped in to the space. We've had CDOs from major universities and Fortune 500s, executive directors of social impact focused nonprofits, consultants, and more all join this community. \u00a0Members have received tactical support and advice to navaigate their company or nonprofit's challenges, gotten weekly updates on the state of DEI at the national and local level, and enjoyed space to brainstorm about how the Alliance can be a powerful example for the state and nation as a model of collective action and workplace practitioner support.\u00a0\n\u00a0\nNow we are ready for our first in-person event! You received an email about this a while back, and this is our final invitation: You are invited! We would LOVE to see you!

They hesitate at the closet each morning, wondering: \n\u201cWill what I wear today be considered \u2018professional\u2019 enough\u2014or too different to be accepted?\u201d\n\u00a0\nYour organization may pride itself on being inclusive\u2014but if the dress code only reflects one cultural norm, it may be unintentionally silencing others.\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\ud83e\udd7b\n \nThe Experience\nFor an Indian woman, a sari is not just an attire\u2014it\u2019s heritage. For a Muslim man, wearing a thobe is a symbol of faith and identity. Yet, in many workplaces, these expressions of culture are quietly discouraged in favor of Western-style suits and skirts.\u00a0\nEmployees begin to self-censor. They conform\u2014not because they want to\u2014but because they feel they have to. And in doing so, they leave a part of themselves at the door.\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u26a0\ufe0f\n \nThe Problem\nWhen your dress code reinforces a narrow idea of what \u201cprofessional\u201d looks like, it doesn\u2019t just limit wardrobe choices\u2014it limits belonging.\u00a0\nThis seemingly minor policy issue becomes a major roadblock to inclusion. Employees feel unseen, undervalued, and disconnected. For team leaders, it becomes a source of friction, pushback, and quiet disengagement that erodes culture from within.\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\ud83d\udca1\n \nThe Future You\u2019re Waiting For\nNow picture this: Your employees walk through the door proud of who they are\u2014and how they show up. Their attire reflects their culture, their values, and their full selves.\u00a0\nYour dress code doesn\u2019t dilute professionalism\u2014it expands it. And your organization becomes known not just for hiring diverse talent, but for keeping it.\u00a0\nThis is the kind of culture where \neveryone feels like they truly belong\n. A culture that thrives on authenticity\u2014not uniformity.\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\ud83c\udfa4\n \nWhat\u2019s Next\nIn Part 2 of this series, coming later this week, I\u2019ll share \npractical, actionable strategies\n to help you evolve your dress code policies in ways that are inclusive, respectful, and still aligned with your organization\u2019s standards.\u00a0\nLet\u2019s move beyond outdated norms and create policies that actually reflect the diverse people who make your workplace great.\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\ud83d\udc49\n Stay tuned\u2014change is on the way.\n\u00a0\nBye for now,\u00a0\n\u00a0\nLuiza\n___________________________________\n\u00a0\nLuiza Dreasher,\u00a0Founder and CEO (she/her/hers)\nMastering Cultural Differences\u00a0\nI work with leaders who want to create a work environment where all employees feel valued and want to stay.\nAt \nMastering Cultural Differences LLC,\n we are committed to helping organizations build inclusive, culturally competent workplaces where every individual feels valued and respected.

This awareness day each year is always striking to me and it feels especially important to share and encourage awareness in these uncertain times when women and marginalized groups are feeling more and more attacked.\nIf you're new to this awareness event, Equal Pay Day marks the current state of the gender pay gap for women: 83% for full-time, year-round workers and 75% for all workers (including part-time and seasonal). This day was originated by the National Committee on Pay Equity (NCPE) in 1996 as a public awareness event to illustrate the gap between men\u2019s and women\u2019s wages. \nThis date symbolizes how many days women must work to earn what men earned in the previous year.\n It's also critical to note that the pay gap varies significantly among different communities, particularly for women of color - see the \nfull calendar\n reported below:\nAll Women\u2019s Equal Pay Day \u2013 March 25th\nAsian American, Native Hawaiian and Pacific Islander (AANHPI) Women\u2019s Equal Pay Day \u2013 April 7th\nMoms\u2019 Equal Pay Day \u2013 May 6th\nLGBTQIA+ Equal Pay Awareness Day \u2013 June 17th\nBlack Women\u2019s Equal Pay Day \u2013 July 10th\nNative Hawaiian and Pacific Islander (NHPI) Women\u2019s Equal Pay Day \u2013 August 28th\nLatina Equal Pay Day \u2013 October 8th\nDisabled Women\u2019s Equal Pay Day \u2013 October 23rd\nNative Women\u2019s Equal Pay Day \u2013 November 18th\nTo be a part of the solution vs. the problem, allies advocate for equal pay because it is important that everyone is paid fairly. This is not just good for women, it is also good for all genders. Financial stress is the single biggest issue households face. The gender pay gap can negatively affect men by causing increased stress and tension within the family. This is due to the fact that men may need to work longer hours to make up for the lower earnings of women or take on the role of the primary earner when unprepared. Ultimately, the unfair pay hurts the well-being of the entire household. \nRead more about why it matters and what you can do here\n \n- be sure to share with your teams.\nThanks allies,\nJulie\n\u200b\n\ud83d\udcac \nAllyship Conversation Starters & Resources\n\u200b\nEmployees care less and less about workplace relationships, new research finds\n - insights from Adam Grant\n\u200b\n\u200b\n \n\u200b\nDEI could get better than ever\n \n- \nThe intense pressure to end diversity initiatives has led companies to scrutinize their policies.

Expands the Talent Pool\nHiring based on skills (rather than degrees or past job titles) opens opportunities to a wider, more diverse group of candidates.\nHelps address labor shortages by recognizing non-traditional career paths and alternative learning (e.g., boot camps, certifications).\n2. Promotes Internal Mobility & Retention\nEmployees can \nmove laterally or upward\n within the company based on demonstrated skills.\nReduces turnover by giving employees career development opportunities without forcing them to leave for promotions elsewhere.\n3. Encourages Continuous Learning & Innovation\nA culture of upskilling and reskilling keeps the workforce adaptable to industry changes.\nEncourages employees to take ownership of their growth, making the company more innovative.\n4. Improves Workforce Agility & Resilience\nOrganizations can quickly \nredeploy\n employees into new roles as business needs shift.\nMore flexibility in assembling \ncross-functional teams\n based on skill sets rather than rigid job descriptions.\n5. Creates a More Inclusive and Equitable Workplace\nReduces bias in hiring by focusing on \nwhat candidates can do\n rather than their backgrounds.\nIncreases diversity by valuing skills gained through alternative education, self-learning, or experience outside of traditional career paths.\n6. Aligns Performance & Compensation with Real Value\nPay and promotions are tied to \nactual skills and contributions\n, not just tenure.\nEncourages a \nmeritocratic environment\n where employees advance based on competency rather than internal politics.\n\u26a0\ufe0f\n Risks and Challenges of a Skill-Based Workplace\n1. Difficult to Implement Without Strong Systems\nRequires \nrobust assessment methods\n to accurately measure skills (e.g., competency tests, project-based evaluations).\nTraditional HR structures (e.g., job descriptions, performance reviews) may need \nsignificant restructuring\n.\n2. Potential for Bias in Skill Assessments\nIf assessments aren\u2019t well-designed, bias can creep in, \nfavoring certain groups\n based on how skills are evaluated.\nSoft skills (e.g., leadership, communication) are harder to quantify, leading to \nsubjective judgments\n.\n3. Resistance from Leadership & Employees\nLeaders accustomed to \ncredential-based hiring\n may be skeptical about hiring/promoting based on skills alone.\nEmployees may feel uncertain about career paths if \ntraditional job titles and hierarchies\n are de-emphasized.\n4. Can Overlook the Value of Experience\nExperience often provides \ncontext, judgment, and industry knowledge\n that raw skills alone don\u2019t cover.\nNew hires with the right skills but \nlittle industry exposure\n might struggle with workplace dynamics or strategic thinking.\n5. Requires Constant Investment in Upskilling & Reskilling\nCompanies must provide \nongoing learning opportunities\n to keep skills relevant.\nWithout a clear \nlearning & development (L&D) strategy\n, employees may feel unsupported or left behind.\n6. Job Role Clarity Can Become Blurred\nEmployees may \njuggle multiple responsibilities\n based on their skill sets, leading to \nrole confusion\n.\nCareer progression paths may feel less structured, making it harder for employees to see their next steps.\n\ud83d\udd0d\n How to Maximize the Benefits While Managing Risks\n\u2705\n \nUse a mix of skills and experience\n \u2192 Prioritize skills but also recognize the value of experience and institutional knowledge.\n\u2705\n \nInvest in strong skill assessments\n \u2192 Develop fair, objective ways to evaluate both \nhard\n and \nsoft\n skills (e.g., work samples, structured interviews).\n\u2705\n \nEnsure leadership buy-in\n \u2192 Train managers on how to \nassess, develop, and reward skills\n instead of relying on traditional career markers.\n\u2705\n \nCreate clear career pathways\n \u2192 Offer structured \nupskilling programs\n and transparent growth opportunities so employees understand how to advance.\n\u2705\n \nFoster a learning culture\n \u2192 Make continuous learning a core part of the workplace, providing employees with the tools to \ndevelop and showcase\n new skills.\nA skill-based approach \ncan future-proof a workplace\n if implemented thoughtfully. However, companies must navigate challenges carefully to avoid bias, role confusion, and resistance to change. Would you like guidance on how to apply this approach to a specific company or industry?\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\nTaking a \nskill-based approach\n to building your workplace means prioritizing skills over traditional factors like job titles, degrees, or years of experience when hiring, developing, and promoting employees. Instead of focusing solely on credentials, organizations identify, assess, and cultivate the specific skills employees need to succeed in their roles.\nKey Aspects of a Skill-Based Workplace:\nHiring Based on Skills, Not Just Credentials\nJob descriptions focus on required skills rather than degree requirements or past job titles.\nCandidates are assessed through practical tests, case studies, or work samples instead of just resumes.\nThis approach widens the talent pool, allowing for more diverse and capable hires.\nInternal Mobility and Career Growth\nEmployees can move between roles based on their skills, not just their formal job history.\nSkill assessments help identify employees ready for new challenges, even in different departments.\nCompanies offer \nupskilling\n and \nreskilling\n programs to help employees grow.\nContinuous Learning and Development\nTraining programs focus on enhancing employees' technical and soft skills.\nMicrolearning, mentorship, and on-the-job experiences are prioritized over one-time training.\nEmployees are encouraged to gain certifications or participate in skills workshops.\nPerformance and Compensation Based on Skills\nRaises and promotions are linked to skill mastery rather than tenure.\nEmployees are evaluated based on their ability to perform key tasks and take on more responsibility.\nBuilding a More Agile and Inclusive Workforce\nOrganizations can adapt faster to industry changes by developing in-demand skills.\nEmployees with non-traditional backgrounds get opportunities based on demonstrated ability.\nEncourages a more \ncollaborative and innovation-driven\n culture.\nExample of a Skill-Based Approach in Action:\nA company needs to fill a \nProject Manager\n role. Instead of requiring 5+ years in project management and a formal degree, they assess candidates on their ability to:\n\u2714\ufe0f\n Organize tasks and timelines\n\u2714\ufe0f\n Communicate effectively with stakeholders\n\u2714\ufe0f\n Use project management software\n\u2714\ufe0f\n Solve problems and adapt to challenges\nThey hire an internal candidate from customer service who has demonstrated these skills in their role and provide additional training to fill any gaps.\nWhy This Matters:\nA skill-based approach \nfuture-proofs\n the workplace by ensuring employees can adapt to changing job requirements. It also fosters \nequity, efficiency, and innovation\n\u2014creating a work environment where people are valued for what they can do, not just their background.\nWould you like insights on how to implement this approach in a specific workplace setting?",

From facilitating virtual discussions about the Executive Orders, to providing peer support to dozens of members navigating the legal and political environment while holding the line for the power of DEI, to creating a brave space for practitioners to open up and support one another during this challenging time...the DEI Alliance has been full of energy and opportunity for those members who have tapped in to the space. We've had CDOs from major universities and Fortune 500s, executive directors of social impact focused nonprofits, consultants, and more all join this community. \u00a0Members have received tactical support and advice to navaigate their company or nonprofit's challenges, gotten weekly updates on the state of DEI at the national and local level, and enjoyed space to brainstorm about how the Alliance can be a powerful example for the state and nation as a model of collective action and workplace practitioner support.\u00a0\n\u00a0\nNow we are ready for our first in-person event!

And a positive one at that.\n\u00a0\nI knew classroom teaching wasn\u2019t my sweet spot, but I dabbled in it on three continents before I found my way to transformational training and facilitation for adults, and a few years later when I became MBTI and coaching certification Sparks of Change was born. I\u2019ve long known I am not the one to lead the movement, but my role is to support and spark, if you will, others to be and do their best. And, in the past two years a new identity emerged as I became a trauma-informed coach and healer, developing myself into a somatic and spiritual leader.\nAs coach, facilitator, trainer, instructional designer and healer\u2014my role is to help people get along just a little better. Corny factor acknowledged, this is my bit towards world peace.\u00a0\nPsst:\n\u00ad\nRead the gory details of my journey summarized in pithy bullet points.\n\u00ad\nAbout Me\n \nLast summer I started itching to figure out how to communicate the common thread to my roles and skills.\u00a0\u00a0\nThus, with help from the amazing folks at \nPerspektiiv\n, \nI am thrilled to launch the new Sparks of Change website!\n\u00ad\nCheck it out now!\u00a0\n \n\u00ad\nI facilitate connection\n\u00a0to yourself, to others and with Spirit.\u00a0\u00a0\nI take a holistic and inclusive approach to wellness, experiential learning and facilitation for individuals and groups interested in transformation and wellbeing.\u00a0\nPromo code: CONNECTION\nTo celebrate and be of service to those who know me and those will be new, \u00a0I am gifting everyone a deep discount to come work with me.\u00a0\n\u00a0\nUse code CONNECTION for a 25% discount on any offering. Must be purchased by April 15, 2025 but you can schedule sessions for any time, they won't expire.\n\u00a0\nThis is heart work, I offer a money back guarantee if you are not satisfied.\u00a0\n\u00a0\nLet's Connect Now\n\u00ad\nI would love to support and learn along with you,\u00a0\n\u00a0\nJoayne Nicole\u00a0\n\u00ad\nSparks of Change\n4509 Oakland Ave, 55407, Minneapolis\nThis email was sent to\u00a0\nlarry@lcwmail.com\nYou've received it because you have indicated interest or subscribed.\nView in browser\n | \nUnsubscribe",

We're thrilled to be back at the Catholic University's Busch School of Business for the 6th year!\nWe have an exciting and\u00a0growing list of sponsors including DELL Technologies, Equinix, Merck, American Airlines, Coca-Cola Consolidated, ServiceNow, among others.\nIn the weeks leading up to the conference, I'll be introducing the exciting elements of the program. This week, meet two of our keynotes!\nSuper Habits\n \nEach year, our most popular keynote has been by the Busch School's Dean\u00a0Andrew Abela. This year promises to be the best yet, as he unpacks the ancient yet modern secrets to a successful life (and business).\u00a0\nEveryone registered gets a free copy of his new book, \nSuper Habits\n: The Universal System for a Successful Life.\nHarvard's Arthur C. Brooks says,\n\u00a0\n\"A\u00a0rich blend of social science and ancient wisdom, Andrew Abela's \nSuperhabits\n shows how strengthening our virtues leads to well-being. This beautiful book is a must-read for anyone in pursuit of the better life.\"\n \nBrighter Days\n \nGet ready for a fun, authentic and inspiring keynote from my friend and colleague, \nPatrick Regan, OBE\n.\nPatrick's new book, \nBrighter Days\n: 12 Steps to Strengthening Your Well-being,\n couldn't be more relevant with all the disruption and divisiveness swirling about.\u00a0It empowers readers to embrace their struggles while equipping them with the tools needed for a healthier, more fulfilling future. Discover that you are not alone in your journey, and get ready to look forward to brighter days ahead!\nPatrick is a sought after mental health provider and founder of three successful NGOs.\u00a0Boris Johnson\u00a0gave him the London Peace Award by for his work in the prevention of knife crime and the late Queen Elizabeth II awarded him an OBE for his services to young people. \n \nThis \nconference\n is part of our global Dare to Overcome initiative that builds religious freedom for all by expanding the space where people's faiths and beliefs have a place at the table. In a growing number of companies, this is through faith-oriented Employee Resource Groups (ERGs) or chaplaincy programs.\nBrian Grim\nPresident, Religious Freedom & Business Foundation\nGlobal Chair, Dare to Overcome \n \nAlso, join us in London\n \n \nIn the News\n \n \nThe results of a troubling new report about the workplace atmosphere for Jewish people is setting off alarm bells. CBN's Raj Nair is joined by Brian Grim, the President of the Religious Freedom & Business Foundation, to break down the upsetting details.\nRadius Research on Employee Resource Groups (ERGs)\n \n \nWeekly Feature\n \n \nWelcome to this week's\u00a0edition of\u00a0Future Trends, the must-read weekly briefing covering the changing face of global politics, economics, development, social and conflict.\nHere's what's happening this week:\u00a0\n\u25ba\u00a0Greenland's opposition in surprise victory\n\u25ba\u00a0Syria\u2019s temporary constitution for five-year transition\n\u25ba\u00a0US and Israel look to Africa for moving Palestinians from Gaza\n\u25ba\u00a0Angola to act as mediator in peace talks between Congo and M23 rebels\n\u25ba\u00a0Walmart friction with China after asking suppliers to absorb tariffs\n\u25ba\u00a0IMF approves $1.2 billion more for Egypt's economic recovery\n\u25ba\u00a0Rwanda cuts ties with Belgium, orders diplomats to leave\n\u25ba\u00a0Annual jab for HIV protection passes trial hurdle\n\u25ba\u00a0\nMore ...\nStay in touch:\n \n \n \n \n \n \nCopyright \u00a9 2025 Religious Freedom & Business Foundation, All rights reserved.\n \nLatest data and news from Brian Grim \nOur mailing address is:\n \nReligious Freedom & Business Foundation\n1A Perry Circle\nAnnapolis\n, \nMD\n \n21402\nAdd us to your address book\nWant to change how you receive these emails?\nYou can \nupdate your preferences\n or \nunsubscribe from this list\n. \n\u2007\ufeff\u034f \u2007\ufeff\u034f \u2007\ufeff\u034f \u2007\ufeff\u034f\u2007\ufeff\u034f \u2007\ufeff\u034f \u2007\ufeff\u034f \u2007\ufeff\u034f\u2007\ufeff\u034f \u2007\ufeff\u034f \u2007\ufeff\u034f \u2007\ufeff\u034f\u2007\ufeff\u034f \u2007\ufeff\u034f \u2007\ufeff\u034f \u2007\ufeff\u034f\u2007\ufeff\u034f \u2007\ufeff\u034f \u2007\ufeff\u034f \u2007\ufeff\u034f\u2007\ufeff\u034f \u2007\ufeff\u034f \u2007\ufeff\u034f \u2007\ufeff\u034f",

Ignoring these dynamics doesn\u2019t erase them. In fact, when organisations embrace racial inclusion, they see better decision-making, greater innovation, and stronger connections.\n\u00a0\nThe question isn\u2019t whether we should talk about race.

I\u2019d miss parts of conversations unless I was face-to-face and focused on whomever was speaking. At first, I reluctantly tried hearing aids, but I felt way too young to need them. I convinced myself I could manage without them.\nFast forward a few years, and working remotely at Included allowed me to control my sound environment, making hearing aids feel unnecessary. I thought I had it all figured out...\n\"\n\u00a0 \nContinue reading...\n \nBreaking Barriers: Beyond the Hashtags, Beyond IWD\nThe conversation on equity and inclusion cannot be confined to a single day.

When employees hesitate to speak up or leaders unknowingly reinforce hierarchy, inclusion suffers.\u00a0\nBut the good news? \nYou can bridge this gap with the right strategies.\n\u00a0\nHere\u2019s how to \nensure power distance doesn\u2019t hold your\u00a0team dynamics back.\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\ud83d\udde3\ufe0f\n \n1. Adapt Your Leadership Style\nA one-size-fits-all approach won\u2019t work if you\u2019re managing a team with different cultural expectations. In \nhigh power-distance\n cultures, provide clear structure and guidance while gradually encouraging participation. In \nlow power-distance\n cultures, foster open dialogue and collaborative decision-making.\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\ud83e\udd1d\n \n2. Set Clear Expectations Around Participation\nMake it known that \nevery voice matters.\n Some employees may be used to top-down decision-making, so explicitly state: \n\u201c\nYour input is valued, and we encourage different perspectives. As part of our culture, we expect everyone to contribute ideas in meetings.\u201d \nSmall shifts in messaging \nsignal that participation is not just welcome but expected.\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\ud83d\udcca\n \n3. Use\u00a0Different\u00a0Feedback Channels\nFor employees hesitant to challenge authority publicly, \ncreate alternative ways to share feedback \nsuch as anonymous surveys, private feedback channels, or one-on-one check-ins with leadership. This removes social pressure and \ngives all employees a way to be heard.\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\ud83c\udf1f\n \n4. Coach Leaders to Be Cultural Translators\nManagers play a critical role in bridging power distance. Train them to:\n\ud83d\udd39\n Recognize when hierarchy is shaping team dynamics\n\ud83d\udd39\n Invite participation in ways that align with cultural norms\n\ud83d\udd39\n Create psychologically safe spaces where speaking up isn\u2019t seen as a risk\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\ud83d\ude80\n \n5. Leverage Mentorship & Sponsorship\nEmployees from high power-distance cultures may wait for permission to advance. \nPair them with mentors who encourage self-advocacy and leadership development. \nSponsorship programs can also help high-potential employees \ngain visibility\n and confidence in contributing.\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\ud83c\udfaf\n \nWhat\u2019s Next? Let\u2019s Put These Strategies into Action!\nUnderstanding power distance is just the first step\u2014applying it effectively is where the real transformation happens.\u00a0\nLet\u2019s chat! \nSchedule a complimentary call with me\n to discuss how you can implement these strategies and build a more inclusive, globally aware workplace.\u00a0\n\ud83d\udcc5\n \nSchedule Your Call Here\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\nHere\u2019s to creating workplaces where\u00a0cultural differences matter!\u00a0\nBye for now,\u00a0\nLuiza\n___________________________________\n\u00a0\nLuiza Dreasher,\u00a0Founder and CEO (she/her/hers)\nMastering Cultural Differences\u00a0\nI work with leaders who want to create a work environment where all employees feel valued and want to stay.\nAt \nMastering Cultural Differences LLC,\n we are committed to helping organizations build inclusive, culturally competent workplaces where every individual feels valued and respected.

The work week proved to be more interesting on Thursday. A surprise illness in our team's family led to me leading an impromptu 4:00 a.m. session on state of women in the workplace for our international colleagues followed by another presentation for US based employees, with an afternoon video shoot for our new speaking reel. \nBy Friday, I was fried, and I had set a goal to finish the last chapter of the new book I am writing about people with power and how they can be better allies. Maybe you can relate if you've had a grueling week, it feels like you're getting punked!\nHowever, I didn't realize there was more in store for us. My daughter has been wrestling with what we thought to be food allergies and stomach pains the last 2 months. It became quite clear that something was seriously wrong so we rushed her to the ER on Friday all to discover that she had a significant health issue that required emergency surgery. Thankfully we live very close to a fantastic children's hospital and she was able to even come home Saturday and go to school this week. \nI'm not sharing this for pity or even commiseration, but if you've had a rough week like this, it's a great reminder of what's important in life. Whether it's the news headlines, or work that you're passionate about feels like it's going away, or your own personal or professional struggles, hope remains. \nI'm practicing a new mantra about \nturning my fear into fuel\n.\n It's not easy. There will be more weeks like last week. However, I'm super thankful my team gets to do work with purpose and my family is safe and healthy. That's what really matters. \nThanks allies,\nJulie\n\u200b\n\ud83d\udcac \nAllyship Conversation Starters & Resources\nThe \ntech industry can\u2019t afford to ignore diversity\n\u200b\n\u200b\n \n\u200b\nSurvey: \nNearly one-third of employees have felt excluded or marginalized at work in the last five years\n\u200b\n\u200b\n \nCare about inclusion for the little ones in your life?

    "body": "Plus: knowing when to step down. \nMarch 19, 2025 \u00a0\u00b7\u00a0 \nView in browser\n \nThe Insightful Leader\nBY \nKELLOGG INSIGHT\nLeadership advice from the Kellogg School of Management at Northwestern University\nGood morning, \nWhen it comes to the stock market, many of us adhere to the mantra \u201cset it and forget it.\u201d We prefer a simple and easy approach to investing so that we can focus our attention on our careers and family.\nBut the market\u2019s recent volatility has made it hard to ignore. This may be especially true for leaders who like to keep their finger on the pulse of their industry, with the well-being of their colleagues and company in mind.\nThis week, we\u2019ll take a look at two new indices built by Kellogg\u2019s \nViktor Todorov\n and \nTorben Andersen\n to help people better understand stock market volatility.\nPlus, Kellogg\u2019s \nDean Karlan\n discusses his decision to resign as chief economist of the U.S. Agency for International Development (USAID).\nA new fear index\nSince 1993, the Cboe Volatility Index (VIX) has offered investors a real-time measure of stock market volatility: namely, how much the market expects prices on the S&P 500 to change over the next 30 days. For this reason, the VIX is also commonly called the \u201cfear index.\u201d\n\u201cWhen things really go bad, people start mentioning, \u2018Oh, the VIX is at a very, very high level,\u2019\u201d says Kellogg\u2019s Viktor Todorov.\nBut despite VIX\u2019s popularity, Todorov and Andersen believe it is hardly the pure measure of volatility or fear that many investors believe. Specifically, they argue that VIX combines into a single measure both investors\u2019 expectations about the S&P 500\u2019s day-to-day volatility and their fears of a rare but catastrophic (or \u201ctail\u201d) event that tanks equity prices.\nTo address these shortcomings, the economists have built two new indices, listed on Cboe alongside VIX, that separately capture these two aspects: the Cboe S&P 500 Spot Volatility Index (SPOTVOL), which focuses on immediate market fluctuations, and the Cboe S&P 500 Left Tail Volatility Index (LTV), which tracks concern over extreme tail events.\nRead more about the indices in \nKellogg Insight\n.\n \nStepping down\nWhen Dean Karlan received the call to take up the mantle of USAID chief economist in 2022, he was both intimidated and thrilled.\nUSAID\u2014which at the time managed the world\u2019s largest bilateral aid portfolio\u2014had recognized Karlan\u2019s research in poverty reduction and invited him to lead the agency\u2019s efforts to make its work more cost-effective. \u201cThat was an ask that was daunting and exciting and why I got into this work in the first place,\u201d he says in a \nrecent podcast\n.\nKarlan set out to identify approaches in the agency that weren\u2019t working so well and to further improve those that were.\n\u201cWe did this work by looking at how decisions were made,\u201d he says, \u201clooking at what was being funded, looking at what the evidence said about the impact of those things, and seeing what the evidence says about alternatives that might be better.\u201d\nSo when the presidential administration announced at the end of January its decision to eliminate the vast majority of USAID\u2019s foreign aid contracts, Karlan pushed for an examination of the evidence that went into the decision-making process. That, he believes, was his responsibility in his leadership position. But his appeals were disregarded.\n\u201cAll patterns indicated that there was nothing resembling evidence of impact that was being used to guide what they were doing, and they were not open to input along those lines,\u201d Karlan says. \u201cIt was clear that there was no role for what I was trying to do.\u201d\nThough he could have held onto his title (his position was not one of the roughly 2,000 flagged for dismissal), Karlan chose to step down instead. He recognized that his role as a leader at the agency was no longer serving its intended purpose.\nHear more from Karlan on \nWBEZ\u2019s Reset\n podcast.\n\u201cThe answer lies not in resisting automation but in designing AI systems that augment human capability rather than replace it.\u201d\n\u2014 \nMohanbir Sawhney\n, in \nBusiness Today\n, on how AI is becoming the next great frontier for countries like India.\nSee you next week,\nAbraham Kim, senior research editor\nKellogg Insight\nFollow us on \nLinkedIn\n.\nAnd listen to our \npodcasts\n.\nKellogg School of Management\n | \n2211 Campus Drive\n, \nEvanston, IL 60208\n \nUnsubscribe larry@lcwmail.com\n \nUpdate Profile\n | \nConstant Contact Data Notice\n \nSent by \ninsight@kellogg.northwestern.edu",

For example, several recent cases resulted in fines for lawyers who provided fictitious citations that were obtained through Gen AI. In response, the American Bar Association issued Formal Opinion 512, reinforcing that ethical obligations under the ABA Model Rules of Professional Conduct remain critical when using Gen AI. Lawyers must ensure accuracy, safeguard client confidentiality, communicate AI use transparently, and uphold reasonable billing practices. \nLaw firms that want to take advantage of AI\u2019s potential must prioritize training, clear policies, and human verification.\nTo learn more, check out this\n \nblog\n.\nRead Blog\n \nPrefer video to text?

You can read more testimonials \nhere\n.\n\u201cI wanted to thank you for speaking recently at our Spring 2024 National Legal Malpractice Conference. We really enjoyed having you and hearing you discuss proximity bias. It was really a worthwhile event and conversation for our panel who really didn't know a great deal about it or a lot of the implications related to it. We \nreally appreciated all the energy and obvious underlying knowledge that you have related to the topic.\n All of our panelists really enjoyed hearing from you, our guests enjoyed hearing from you, and we look forward to working with you again.\u201d\n\u200c\nJay Reyes\n, \nChief Counsel at the American Bar Association\nSchedule a Free Consultation\n \nWhat's Up With Me\nMy wife and business partner, Agnes Vishnevkin, and Iwere making our plans to travel from our hometown of Columbus, Ohio, to visit my parents for my mom\u2019s 75th birthday in New York City. At the same time, she\u2019s been struggling with a period of back pain for the past two months. Her condition fluctuated, but it was worse again in the days leading up to the trip, so I suggested she should skip the trip. She was quite reluctant to do so, because she was concerned that my mother would be upset. I was surprised how hard it was to convince her to agree to stay home.\nThis is the kind of situation where she and I differ: I tend to think people will understand and forgive, while she is more worried about others\u2019 judgments. Maybe sometimes I underestimate how judgmental people might be, but in this case I think I was right. Sometimes, we need to reduce our concerns about other people\u2019s opinions and focus on our own self-care. Now, that doesn\u2019t mean being a jerk, there has to be a balance, but in this case the balance to me was clearly toward self-care. \nWhat do you think should be the balance between self-care and consideration of other people\u2019s feelings?\n\u00a0\nWould love to get your feedback on what you found most useful about this edition of the \u201cWise Decision Maker Guide\u201d - simply reply to this email.\nDecisively Yours,\nDr. Gleb\nDr. Gleb Tsipursky\nCEO of Disaster Avoidance Experts\nPS: Are we connected on LinkedIn?

Your goal? An inclusive workplace where everyone feels heard.\u00a0\nYet, in some global teams, silence fills the room. Junior employees hesitate to speak in meetings. Some leaders make decisions with little input from their teams. And despite your efforts, true inclusivity feels out of reach.\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\ud83e\udd14\n \nThe Experience:\nImagine a new hire from a hierarchical culture\u2014where questioning leadership is seen as disrespectful. When asked for feedback, they stay quiet, unsure if speaking up is truly welcome. Meanwhile, their manager\u2014accustomed to top-down leadership\u2014assumes silence means agreement.\u00a0\nThe result? \nMissed perspectives, disengaged employees, and stalled progress on your goals.\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u26a0\ufe0f\n \nThe Problem:\nGlobal teams bring diverse perspectives, but power distance\u2014the level of hierarchy people expect in the workplace\u2014shapes how employees engage. In \nhigh power-distance cultures\n, hierarchy is respected, and decisions flow from the top. In \nlow power-distance cultures\n, employees expect open dialogue and shared decision-making.\u00a0\nWhen these cultural expectations clash:\n\u274c\n Employees from hierarchical cultures hesitate to challenge authority.\n\u274c\n Leaders from egalitarian cultures struggle to engage hierarchical teams.\n\u274c\n Critical workplace discussions remain one-sided, limiting real change.\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\ud83d\udca1\n \nThe Future You\u2019re Waiting For:\nNow, imagine an organization where:\n\u2705\n Every employee\u2014regardless of background\u2014feels empowered to contribute.\n\u2705\n Leaders recognize and adapt to different cultural expectations.\n\u2705\n Inclusion initiatives succeed because engagement isn\u2019t dictated by hierarchy.\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\ud83c\udfa4\n \nWhat\u2019s Next?\nIn my next email, I\u2019ll share \nspecific strategies\n to navigate power distance effectively\u2014so you can foster a truly inclusive workplace without cultural misalignment holding you back. Stay tuned!\u00a0\n\u00a0\nBye for now,\u00a0\nLuiza\n___________________________________\n\u00a0\nLuiza Dreasher,\u00a0Founder and CEO (she/her/hers)\nMastering Cultural Differences\u00a0\nI work with leaders who want to create a work environment where all employees feel valued and want to stay.\nAt \nMastering Cultural Differences LLC,\n we are committed to helping organizations build inclusive, culturally competent workplaces where every individual feels valued and respected.

It seems like they won\u2019t be starting until late April earliest, though we don\u2019t have an exact date yet because there are several unknowns right now (still on Mondays and Fridays). Juri and I are following up on a couple of requests and are moving as quickly as we can so that delays cannot be attributed to us.

It seems like they won\u2019t be starting until late April earliest, though we don\u2019t have an exact date yet because there are several unknowns right now (still on Mondays and Fridays). Juri and I are following up on a couple of requests and are moving as quickly as we can so that delays cannot be attributed to us. I\u2019m sorry about this back-and-forth, I understand how it could be affecting your planning. Sadly, we\u2019re doing all we possibly can to get this started and yet here we are. \n\u00a0\nRP \n\u00a0\nRebecca M.

By 2021, remote work participation had surged, especially in professional, scientific, and technical services, as well as information and finance industries. The rise in remote work contributed positively to Total Factor Productivity (TFP) growth across 61 private-sector industries, particularly through reduced nonlabor costs, such as office space expenses.\nFrom 2019 to 2022, the increase in remote work was linked to a 1.1 percentage-point rise in industry-level productivity, with companies benefiting from lower turnover and operational efficiencies. However, productivity gains were not passed to employees through higher compensation. Instead, workers reaped indirect benefits, such as reduced commuting time and expenses. Despite these advantages, industries varied in their ability to balance output and labor input. For most high-productivity sectors, output growth outpaced labor input increases, indicating efficient use of remote work.\nDr. Gleb\u2019s Take\nThis study confirms that remote work isn\u2019t just a convenience\u2014it\u2019s a powerful driver of productivity and cost-efficiency. Businesses that adapt to remote or hybrid models are gaining a competitive edge, leveraging reduced office space and operational costs while enhancing employee retention.\nHowever, the failure to share these productivity gains with employees reflects shortsighted leadership. Workers saved time and money on commuting, but organizations missed an opportunity to strengthen loyalty by sharing financial benefits to support workers being more productive and comfortable in their home offices. I always advise my clients to invest into employee home offices, such as good tech, ergonomic furniture, and fast internet, which is a win-win for employees and companies alike.\u00a0\nThe data is clear: remote work is not a temporary pandemic solution but a sustainable model for the future of work. Leaders who embrace and optimize this shift will outperform competitors who cling to outdated, office-centric paradigms.\n\u201c\nBaby boomers say they don\u2019t need to retire now that they can work from home\u2014and they\u2019ve got side hustles on top of their 9-to-5\u2019s\n\u201d (Fortune)\nSummary\nRemote and hybrid work have reshaped retirement plans for baby boomers, allowing them to extend their careers while enjoying better work-life balance. A survey by Smart Energy GB found that nearly 70% of those over 60 are working in hybrid roles, while others work remotely full-time. Without the stress of commuting, many baby boomers are energized to take on side hustles, with tutoring being the most popular choice.\nThe flexibility of remote work has enabled 25% of surveyed boomers to explore new hobbies they had planned for retirement, such as gardening, yoga, and walking. This dual approach to career and leisure has left 66% feeling less stressed, 94% reporting a renewed zest for life, and 90% expressing satisfaction with their careers.\nGlobally, the trend of \u201cunretiring\u201d is growing. In the U.K., 14% of baby boomers and late Gen Xers have returned to work, with an additional 4% considering it. In the U.S., the share of workers aged 65 and older has nearly doubled since the 1980s, with 20% of that age group now employed. Many older workers cite financial concerns as a key reason for staying in or returning to the workforce.\nDr. Gleb\u2019s Take\nThis is a striking testament to the transformative power of remote work. Baby boomers have cracked the code to achieving both financial security and personal fulfillment in their later years. By eliminating the daily grind of commuting, remote work has given them the flexibility to maintain their income while pursuing hobbies and even side gigs.\nEmployers should take note: offering hybrid or fully remote roles is not just a perk\u2014it\u2019s a retention strategy for experienced, highly skilled workers. Boomers bring decades of expertise, and their willingness to stay in the workforce longer is a massive asset to businesses willing to adapt to their needs.\nThe \"unretiring\" trend also highlights a cultural shift. Work is no longer seen as a binary choice between career and retirement. Instead, flexible models enable older workers to blend income, passion projects, and personal growth. Companies that fail to embrace this model risk losing out on a wealth of institutional knowledge and leadership from seasoned a multigenerational workforce.\u00a0\n\"\nMatt Yglesias Considered As The Nietzschean Superman\n\" (Astral Codex Ten)\nSummary\nThis piece explores Nietzsche's concepts of \"master morality\" and \"slave morality,\" contrasting their historical roots and societal impacts. Master morality celebrates strength, achievement, and individual excellence, while slave morality emphasizes humility, equality, and harm reduction. The article critiques both frameworks, noting that slave morality often manifests as an obsession with diminishing oneself or others to avoid judgment, while master morality can devolve into arrogance and disregard for communal well-being.\nThrough diverse examples\u2014from Puritans and Soviet propaganda to Ayn Rand and modern liberalism\u2014the essay navigates attempts to reconcile these moralities. Figures like Ayn Rand and Richard Hanania represent different approaches to integrating Nietzschean ideas into modern frameworks. The author concludes by endorsing a \"spiral of values,\" where altruism and ambition coexist in a dynamic balance to glorify civilization and improve human happiness.\nDr. Gleb\u2019s Take\nThis essay is a masterful exploration of moral frameworks, and gets at a key point: the dichotomy of master and slave morality is too simplistic for the complexity of modern life. Both approaches contain dangerous extremes\u2014unchecked master morality fosters exploitation and harm, while uncritical slave morality stifles innovation and achievement.\nThe path forward isn\u2019t in choosing one over the other or crafting tenuous compromises like \u201cliberal democracy.\u201d It\u2019s in embracing \nadaptive morality\n: a system where individuals and societies balance personal excellence with collective good. This means rewarding ambition when it uplifts others and challenging humility when it becomes performative or self-defeating.\nNietzsche\u2019s Superman isn\u2019t a literal figure\u2014it\u2019s a call to evolve past outdated binaries. We need a vision that values strength as a tool for service and humility as a path to growth. That\u2019s how you build a world where ambition thrives without crushing the vulnerable.\nWhat did you think of my take on these articles?

stalled because she was seen as a great worker\u2014but not a leader?\u00a0\nShe\u2019s not alone. \u00a0\nWhen positive stereotypes limit career growth, organizations lose out on diverse leadership, innovation, and employee engagement.\n\u00a0\nBut here\u2019s the good news: \nYou have the power to change this.\n \u00a0\nHere are \nfive actionable strategies\n to dismantle the hidden barriers of \u201cpositive\u201d stereotypes in your workplace:\n\u00a0\n1\ufe0f\u20e3 \nRedefine Leadership Beyond the Traditional Mold\nToo often, leadership is defined by outdated, Western-centric traits\u2014assertiveness, outspokenness, and charisma. \nExpand your definition\n to value diverse leadership styles like collaboration, cultural intelligence, and thoughtful decision-making. \u00a0\nAsk yourself:\n Are my promotion criteria inclusive of different leadership approaches?\u00a0\n\u00a0\n2\ufe0f\u20e3 \nAudit Performance Reviews for Bias\nUnconscious bias creeps into performance evaluations. Asian employees, for example, may be praised for technical skills but overlooked for strategic thinking or leadership potential.\u00a0\nSolution:\n Conduct bias audits in your review and promotion processes. Ensure that growth opportunities aren\u2019t based on assumptions but on demonstrated impact and potential.\u00a0\n\u00a0\n3\ufe0f\u20e3 \nCreate Sponsorship, Not Just Mentorship\nMentorship is great, but sponsorship is a game-changer. Sponsors actively \nadvocate\n for employees, recommending them for high-visibility projects and leadership roles.\u00a0\nAction Step:\n Pair underrepresented employees with senior leaders who can advocate for their growth\u2014not just offer advice.\u00a0\n\u00a0\n4\ufe0f\u20e3 \nFoster a Culture Where All Voices Are Heard\nEmployees who don\u2019t fit the traditional leadership mold may hesitate to speak up in meetings\u2014especially if they\u2019ve been conditioned to stay in the background.\u00a0\nSolution:\n\u00a0\nEncourage psychological safety in meetings. Actively invite different perspectives, and ensure that contributions are valued\u2014not dismissed or overlooked.\u00a0\n\u00a0\n5\ufe0f\u20e3 \nOffer Cultural Competence Training\nThe best way to tackle unconscious bias? \nAwareness and education.\n Provide ongoing training that helps managers and employees recognize and challenge stereotypes in real time.\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\ud83c\udfaf\n \nNeed a customized approach? Let\u2019s talk.\nBreaking free from \u201cpositive\u201d stereotypes isn\u2019t just about fairness\u2014it\u2019s about unlocking the full potential of your workforce. Let\u2019s discuss how you can implement these strategies in your organization. \u00a0\nSchedule a complimentary call with me today, and let\u2019s start building a truly inclusive leadership pipeline.\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\ud83d\udcc5\n \nBook Your\u00a0Complimentary Call Now\n \n\u00a0\n\u00a0\nBye for now,\u00a0\nLuiza\n___________________________________\n\u00a0\nLuiza Dreasher,\u00a0Founder and CEO (she/her/hers)\nMastering Cultural Differences\u00a0\nI work with leaders who want to create a work environment where all employees feel valued and want to stay.\nAt \nMastering Cultural Differences LLC,\n we are committed to helping organizations build inclusive, culturally competent workplaces where every individual feels valued and respected.

    "body": "HSBC Bank has a Global Faith Network\n \n \nBusiness case for Faith employee resource groups (ERGs)\n \nDear Larry Baker,\u00a0\nA new \"\nGlobal ERG Impact Report\n\" by Radius Networks highlights the crucial role Employee Resource Groups (ERGs) play in organizations. The study interviewed more than 1,400\u00a0global companies across Asia-Pacific, Europe, the Middle East, and Africa.\nThe\u00a0report highlights the impact of leveraging employee networks' lived experiences to reach new customers, from facilitating discussions on faith and finance in APAC to enhancing social mobility in EMEA and amplifying employee voices in the Americas.\nBusiness Impact of HSBC\u2019s Global Faith Network\n \nJack Guest, HSBC\u2019s Senior Group Inclusion Advisor, emphasizes in the report that employee networks are not just about fostering belonging within the workplace\u2014they are key drivers of meaningful change both inside and outside the organization. Employee Faith Network Drive Change Within and Beyond the Workplace\nThe report discusses how HSBC\u2019s Global Faith Network is reshaping the bank\u2019s approach to understanding and adapting to a variety of religious perspectives on finance.\n \n\u201cFor many of our markets, faith is a really important factor when it comes to how people think about money\u201d, says Jack in the \nreport\n. \u201cOur employee networks have helped us to understand and respond to these nuanced perspectives, which has in turn strengthened our reputation as a bank that understands its customers.\u201d \nThe report notes that employee networks have transformed the way this commercial and personal bank engages with its community. By organizing events tied to festivals such as Eid, Diwali, and Hanukkah, these networks foster multi-faith understanding, with HSBC\u2019s Country CEOs in attendance.\n\u201cClients and customers say that our faith events help them to feel valued\u201d, says Jack. \u201cThey allow us to build deeper relationships which we couldn\u2019t achieve without our networks.\u201d \n \nAnd when employees are allowed to bring their faith and belief identities to work, this \n\"builds\" religious freedom for all\n by expanding the space where faith and beliefs are welcomed as valuable sources of inspiration and resiliency. Check out related resources below.\nBrian Grim\nPresident\nReligious Freedom & Business Foundation \nRegistration Open (London & Washington DC)\n \n \n \nIn the News\n \n \nIn some of the United States' largest companies, religious affinity groups\u2014formed by employees of various faiths\u2014serve as spaces for dialogue and advocacy. U.S. employers are required to accommodate employees' religious practices. By Alexis Buisson. \nRead more\n. \nResearch\n \n \n \nMany workplace leaders avoid addressing religion explicitly for fear of conflict. But Ecklund, Daniels, and Scheitle argue that ignoring religion\u2019s presence at work can cause more harm than good. This is the case because many employees\u00a0\nwant\n\u00a0to express or practice their faith at work as part of bringing their authentic selves to work, and they feel excluded or stifled if discouraged from doing so. \nRead more\n.\u00a0 \nThe Power of Jewish ERGs: Findings From Clal\u2019s Research Report, Jewish at Work 2024\n \n \nDemand for Jewish ERGs is Growing: The movement for Jewish ERGs is gaining momentum, with 46% of new members joining since October 7, 2023.

I facilitated an opening session on the current state of diversity, equity and inclusion with tools to develop the next generation of little allies. The conversations at the conference were very mixed on the state of inclusion... Some extremely passionate, some fearful and a lot of people in between. \nSimilar to the conversations we're having in corporate spaces, diversity is a fact. Diverse representation is a reality. However, the pushback is also real. Many commented that their superintendents or leaders were preventing them from talking about inclusion issues with children.\nInclusion is the way forward. Accepting the status quo is exclusionary. When we quiet allies, we are promoting exclusion. \nIn my session, like our client sessions, I used a polling exercise for anonymous sharing. One of the questions I asked is, \n\"Why is it important to have this conversation about inclusion earlier?\".\n It always brings me such joy to see the responses:\nI want all children to feel safe.\nI wish I'd had these conversations earlier.\nEveryone deserves to feel included. \nI want a better world for future generations. \nI know what it's like to feel excluded and I don't want that for other people. \nOur work is definitely at a pivot point. Even if it feels risky to bring up social justice or issues of inclusion, do it afraid. Have the courage to be the ally someone needs you to be right now. \nI get it. I know I'm channeling a lot of courage right now too. Take care of yourself. This is going to be a long game. \nThanks allies,\nJulie\nP.S. I also had the chance to facilitate a team building session with my 11-year-old, Jane's soccer team about communication and team values.

    "body": "Plus: what to wear and what it says about you. \nMarch 12, 2025 \u00a0\u00b7\u00a0 \nView in browser\n \nThe Insightful Leader\nBY \nKELLOGG INSIGHT\nLeadership advice from the Kellogg School of Management at Northwestern University\nGood morning,\nBehind every great success story lie even greater tales of failure. Steven Spielberg was rejected from film school three times. Oprah Winfrey was fired from her first anchor job. There\u2019s a good reason this has become something of a valuable clich\u00e9.\nSetbacks can be a crucial part of young professionals\u2019 development, according to research from Kellogg\u2019s \nBen Jones\n and \nDashun Wang\n. More on that this week.\nPlus, if, like me, you're readying yourself for spring cleaning, consider a few words of advice about your work wardrobe from Kellogg\u2019s \nEllen Taaffe\n.\nThe science of failure and success\nFailure has become a kind of essential ingredient for professional development. A Google News search of just the last week brings up hundreds of articles discussing some form of professional failure: lessons learned from the failed SpaceX launch at \nNPR\n, for example, or how to handle rejection in goal setting at \nVox\n.\nWhat\u2019s the appeal? Taking steps to learn from failure can pay dividends in the long run.\nJust last week, \nForbes\n discussed five ways setbacks can fuel career success, highlighting Jones and Wang\u2019s \n2019 study of grant applications\n. Jones and Wang examined a dataset of 778,291 R01 NIH grants between 1990 and 2005\u2014NIH\u2019s oldest and most common grant type and hugely important to early career researchers in the biomedical sciences. Then the team determined which grants fell just short of receiving funding (\u201cnear miss\u201d grants) and which managed to squeak past the cutoff point (\u201cnarrow wins\u201d). And to figure out just how much of a difference these early successes or setbacks made to a scientific career, the researchers traced the careers of 623 near-miss and 561 narrow-win scientists.\nThey found that scientists in the near-miss group were more likely to have \u201chit\u201d papers (that is, papers that cracked the top-five percent of citations in a particular field and year). The team\u2019s analysis also suggests that the act itself of failing may have pushed the frustrated scientists to improve.\n\u201cThe advice to persevere is common,\u201d \nsays Jones in \nKellogg Insight\n. \u201cBut the idea that you take something valuable from the loss\u2014and are better for it\u2014is surprising and inspiring.\u201d\nRead more about the research in \nKellogg Insight\n. (Plus enjoy additional research and insights on the upsides of failure \nhere\n.)\n \nWhat to wear\u2014and what it says about you\nThe decision on how to dress is one of many that we make every day, despite it seeming to have nothing to do with our jobs. It\u2019s a decision about how we want to be seen, or not seen, by our bosses and coworkers and clients. On a recently re-released The Insightful Leader \npodcast\n, Kellogg\u2019s Ellen Taaffe reflects on those dilemmas. She thinks \na lot\n about the question of how we present ourselves.\nBefore Kellogg, she was a brand-management executive at PepsiCo, Whirlpool, and Royal Caribbean. While on one sales team, her boss asked her not to wear red. She didn\u2019t want to wear black or navy\u2014it didn\u2019t suit her. So finally, she decided to go her own way.\n\u201cI think it definitely was a time when I was gathering my courage. To, a little bit, go against what my boss had said,\u201d says Taaffe. \u201cBut I can remember one particular meeting when I did lay out my clothes the night before. It was just this feeling of, I don't know what his reaction is, but this is who I am.\u201d\nIt can take courage to let your identity show at work. And sometimes, it might be smart to reign it in a little\u2014at least for a while.\nFor more on how you should present yourself at work, listen to Taaffe and Kellogg\u2019s \nDerek Rucker\n on \nThe Insightful Leader podcast\n.\n\u201cIt is really important for people to have a clear understanding that programs like Medicaid are essential for a functioning society.\u201d\n\u2014 \nLauren Rivera\n, in \nYahoo! Finance\n, on the potential impact of cutting government healthcare programs like Medicaid.\nHave a wonderful week!\nBlake Goble, marketing manager\nKellogg Insight\nFollow us on \nLinkedIn\n.\nAnd listen to our \npodcasts\n.\nKellogg School of Management\n | \n2211 Campus Drive\n, \nEvanston, IL 60208\n \nUnsubscribe larry@lcwmail.com\n \nUpdate Profile\n | \nConstant Contact Data Notice\n \nSent by \ninsight@kellogg.northwestern.edu",

The recently announced deferred resignation program, introduced via an Office of Personnel Management (OPM) memo, offers federal employees a lucrative off-ramp: full pay and benefits until September 30, 2025, with exemption from in-person work requirements, and many put on administrative leave. \nMany will take this offer. Facing mounting uncertainty, a hostile workplace environment, and the erosion of once-ironclad civil service protections, thousands of employees will see this as their best\u2014or perhaps only\u2014chance to leave on their own terms before being pushed out under harsher conditions later. Those most likely to accept the offer? The most experienced, highly skilled federal employees who know their value and have private-sector options.\n The consequences of this mass departure will not be felt immediately. That\u2019s what makes this such a dangerous, slow-moving disaster.\nTo learn more, check out this \nblog\n.\nRead Blog\n \nPrefer video to text? See this \nvideo\n based on the blog:\nIf you prefer audio, listen to this \npodcast\n based on the blog:\nMake Your Voice Heard\nVote in this \nLinkedIn poll\n to contribute to the conversation. I will use the responses to inform my articles in \nHarvard Business Review\n, \nFortune\n, and \nEntrepreneur\n.\nYour Testimonials\nYou and others who gain value from Disaster Avoidance Experts \nservices\n and thought leadership occasionally share testimonials about your experience, such as the one below. You can read more testimonials \nhere\n.\n\"Dr. Gleb Tsipursky presented [to] senior executive leaders and practitioners from throughout the region. The audience was \nvery appreciative of the informative content and inspired by Dr. Gleb\u2019s engaging and dynamic speaking style. Everyone benefited from the real-life, useful 'takeaways' that they could implement into their own work life right away.\n The feedback was universally positive with many people commenting that they had received \ntremendous value in return for their time in attending the three-hour program.\n There have been several requests that Dr. Gleb be invited back again soon.\"\nDavid Cutri\n, Vice President Northwest Ohio ISACA Chapter, and Secretary Northwest Ohio IIA Chapter\nSchedule a Free Consultation\n \nWhat's Up With Me\nIt's been really hard to see the situation with my fatherland of Ukraine. Military assistance cut off, and even intelligence cut off. I'll be traveling to New York later this week to visit my parents for my mom's 75th birthday, and I feel ashamed in front of my dad, who is 84, and was born in Ukraine (my mom was born in Moldova). I anticipate\u00a0some hard conversations about how he's feeling about the country he immigrated to with my mom and me in 1991, after his homeland was freed from Russian domination. All this time, America served as a bastion of freedom and defense against tyranny, and my dad was proud to live here and taught me to be proud of America. What's happening right now feels like a betrayal, and the long-term consequences will be dire, with our allies around the world no longer being able to count on us and thus failing to support us when we need them. In fact, the only time the NATO alliance's self-defense clause was invoked involved the attack on the US on 9/11, when the US needed help in Afghanistan. What we're seeing is truly a slow-moving train wreck, of promises broken and allies betrayed.\nWould love to get your feedback on what you found most useful about this edition of the \u201cWise Decision Maker Guide\u201d - simply reply to this email.\nDecisively Yours,\nDr. Gleb\nDr. Gleb Tsipursky\nCEO of Disaster Avoidance Experts\nPS: Are we connected on LinkedIn?

Mei is incredibly detail-oriented, excellent with numbers, and rarely speaks up in meetings. Leadership views her as a \u201cperfect team player\u201d because she never challenges decisions or takes risks. She\u2019s frequently praised for being diligent, but when it comes to promotions, Mei is passed over. The assumption? She\u2019s not \u201cleadership material.\u201d\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\ud83e\udd14\n \nThe Experience:\nFor many professionals\u2014especially those from underrepresented backgrounds\u2014so-called \n\u201cpositive\u201d stereotypes\n create invisible barriers. For example, Asian Americans are seen as technically gifted but lacking leadership presence. Black women are assumed to be strong and resilient, but not \u201cwarm\u201d enough for executive roles. Women in general are praised for being collaborative but criticized when they assert authority.\u00a0\nThese stereotypes may seem complimentary, but they \nbox employees in\n, limiting opportunities and stalling careers.\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u26a0\ufe0f\n \nThe Problem:\nWhen organizations unknowingly reinforce these biases, they:\n\ud83d\udea7\n Fail to recognize diverse leadership styles, narrowing their talent pipeline.\n\ud83d\udea7\n Create disengagement as employees feel unseen or undervalued.\n\ud83d\udea7\n Lose out on innovation and diverse perspectives that drive business success.\u00a0\nAnd when employees feel trapped by stereotypes, inclusion remains an illusion.\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\ud83d\udca1\n \nThe Future You\u2019re Waiting For:\nNow, imagine a workplace where every employee\u2014regardless of race, gender, or background\u2014is seen for their \nunique strengths and leadership potential.\n A workplace where diverse perspectives thrive, and opportunities are based on \ncapabilities, not assumptions.\n\u00a0\nThat kind of inclusive culture isn\u2019t just possible\u2014it\u2019s necessary for long-term success.\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\ud83c\udfa4\n \nWhat\u2019s Next:\nIn my next email, I\u2019ll share \nspecific strategies\n to break free from these \u201cpositive\u201d stereotypes and foster a truly inclusive workplace. Watch your inbox for actionable steps to drive real change.\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\nBye for now,\u00a0\nLuiza\n___________________________________\n\u00a0\nLuiza Dreasher,\u00a0Founder\u00a0and CEO (she/her/hers)\nMastering Cultural Differences\u00a0\nI work with leaders who want to create a work environment where all employees feel valued and want to stay.\nAt \nMastering Cultural Differences LLC,\n we are committed to helping organizations build inclusive, culturally competent workplaces where every individual feels valued and respected.

This ripple effect is one of the most powerful ways to drive inclusivity, and it\u2019s something we should continue to invest in, each and every day.\n\u00a0\nLet\u2019s continue to make strides towards a gender-equal world.\n\u00a0\nSCHEDULE TIME TO TALK\n \nLEARN MORE\n \nSymmetra Pty Ltd, Quay Quarter Towers, Level 2, 50 Bridge Street, Sydney, NSW 2000 Australia, hello@symmetraglobal.com \nUnsubscribe",

    "subject": "More \u201cMasculine Energy?\u201d No thanks\u2026Bring on the Lionesses.",
    "body": "\u201cYou know, Mom, you\u2019re like lionesses!\u201d\n \n \n \nMy daughter and I were walking to school the other morning. Along the way, I exchanged greetings with several female neighbors. We exchanged brief words of encouragement, checked in on how things were going with family members and jobs, offered assistance with kids and meals. \u00a0\nMy daughter said, \u201cYou know, Mom, you\u2019re like lionesses!\u201d\u00a0\nNow, for some context, my kid and I watch a lot of wildlife documentaries. Lions often represent the pinnacle of masculine strength, with the male lion being lauded as the \u201cKing of the Beasts.\u201d But that moniker doesn\u2019t give much credit to who\u2019s really running the pride.\nUnlike most animal species, lion prides are matriarchal. The females create a centralized, stable system around which the pride functions. Lionesses are deeply social and collaborative. They not only care for the cubs, they also do the majority of the hunting and are fierce defenders, taking on much larger predators to protect their pride.\u00a0\nWhen leaders like Mark Zuckerberg complain that the corporate world has become \n\u201cculturally neutered\u201d and call for more \u00a0\u201cmasculine energy\u201d in the workplace\n, what they mean is a work culture that rewards behaviors that go \nagainst\n the cooperative mentality that makes a pride thrive - they're talking about aggressive, winner-take-all, competitive behaviors that drive isolation, not collaboration.\nThis is problematic for multiple reasons.\u00a0\nIt overlooks the fact that \nmasculinity contest work cultures are counterproductive\n, and not only that, \nwomen and men alike\n don\u2019t actually like working in them. \u00a0Studies have shown that constructive organizational cultures are both humanistic and achievement-oriented. They reward healthy competition and constructive conflict as well as empathy, compassion, and collaboration.\u00a0\n\u00a0\nIt contributes to the rising wave of toxic masculinity, which is not only backwards but dangerous. Global studies are finding that \u00a0\nwomen are increasingly afraid of men\n, and with good reason. Cases of assault, stalking, and violence against women and members of the trans community have increased dramatically in the last few years. In the US, there was a \n4600 percent increase in misogynistic speech in December 2024 following the November election\n. For example, terms like, \"Your body, my choice\" and \"Get back in the kitchen\" increased exponentially on the social media platform X.\u00a0\n\u00a0\nIt further diminishes women\u2019s participation in what have been traditionally male-dominated industries and jobs, including science, technology, math, and engineering (STEM), finance, venture capital, law enforcement, and active combat. In all of these industries, women can and do play critical roles and are \nfound to be equal in competence to their male counterparts\n, and in some cases provide unique values because of their identity experiences.\u00a0\nWomen\u2019s History Month is a opportunity to celebrate the great many accomplishments of women throughout the generations. Yet, it is also a call to action for all of us, \nincluding men\n, to contribute to cultures that promote more collaboration and compassion alongside healthy competition. Ditch the bro culture, chainsaw wielding, \u201cGo back to the kitchen\u201d messages. They ultimately don\u2019t serve anyone, not even the bros with the chainsaws.\u00a0\n\u00a0\nMaria Morukian\nFounder and Chief Executive Officer\nMSM Global Consulting\nMSM GLOBAL UPDATES\n \nThis past month, Maria Morukian shared two insightful articles on LinkedIn that explore critical conversations shaping the future of diversity, equity, and inclusion. As organizations navigate evolving legal landscapes and push back against the false narratives surrounding merit and inclusion, these pieces from Harvard Business Review offer timely perspectives. Below, we summarize key takeaways from each article and why they matter for leaders committed to DEI as a strategic priority:\nHow to Assess the New Legal Risks of Your DEI Policies\nAs legal challenges to DEI policies become more prevalent, organizations must proactively assess risk while staying true to their commitment to equity. This HBR article provides a strategic framework for leaders to evaluate their DEI initiatives in light of evolving regulations. It outlines key legal considerations, including affirmative action rollbacks, new compliance expectations, and the importance of transparency in decision-making. Rather than retreating from DEI efforts, businesses are encouraged to refine their strategies which will ensure they align with both legal and ethical imperatives. The article underscores the need for ongoing education, legal consultation, and thoughtful adaptation to maintain inclusive workplaces without compromising compliance.\nThe False Dichotomy of Merit and Inclusion\nOne of the most persistent myths in DEI conversations is the idea that merit and inclusion are opposing forces. This article challenges that false dichotomy, arguing that diversity actually enhances merit by broadening the pool of talent and perspectives within an organization. The piece critiques outdated views of meritocracy, which often fail to account for systemic barriers that limit opportunity. By redefining merit to include diverse experiences and capabilities, businesses can cultivate stronger, more innovative teams. The takeaway? Inclusion isn\u2019t, and has never been, about lowering standards.\u00a0\nIt\u2019s about recognizing excellence in all its forms from diverse backgrounds and institutions.\n \nCulture Stew\nLast year we produced this episode, and \u00a0thought it was worth a reheat, especially considering the increasing challenges public educators face in supporting the needs of diverse students. Culturally fluent education is increasingly crucial to the future success of our children. In this episode of Culture Stew, Maria met with Dr. Ayanna F. Brown to explore the evolving landscape of equity in education. From systemic challenges to actionable strategies, Dr. Brown shares her insights on fostering meaningful change in schools and communities. Whether you're an educator, leader, or advocate, this conversation sheds light on the work needed to create inclusive learning environments that truly serve all students.\u00a0\nWatch the full episode here: \nYouTube\nRead more about the episode and listen to the podcast: \nMSM Global Consulting\nDon\u2019t forget to check out past episodes on our Culture Stew \nYouTube channel\n!

A short five star review can help get the podcast out to more viewers! \nMSM GLOBAL GALLERY\nHere you can find curated content of current DEI issues and events for your further exploration.\n \nHow Americans See Men and Masculinity | Pew Research Center\nA recent Pew Research Center study explored how Americans perceive the roles and expectations of men today. The findings highlight generational and ideological divides in attitudes toward traditional masculinity, emotional expression, and societal pressures on men. While many acknowledge the challenges men face, including mental health struggles and rigid gender norms, there is also growing support for redefining masculinity in ways that embrace vulnerability, caregiving, and emotional intelligence. This report provides valuable insight into how these shifting perspectives influence workplaces, relationships, and broader social dynamics.\nWomen leaders make work better. Here\u2019s the science behind how to promote them.\nResearch from the American Psychological Association reveals that female leaders are not only breaking barriers but also transforming workplace cultures for the better. The study highlights how organizations with women in leadership roles tend to foster more inclusive, supportive, and equitable environments\u2014benefiting employees across all demographics. Women leaders are more likely to implement policies that prioritize well-being, mentorship, and collaboration, ultimately driving higher engagement and performance. The article underscores the importance of diversifying leadership teams and challenging outdated biases about gender and leadership effectiveness.\n\u00a0 \nWe're waiting for you!\u00a0\nWould you like to be a guest on the Culture Stew Podcast?\u00a0\nDo you have a publication we can share on our newsletter or on our social media accounts?\u00a0\n\u00a0\nContact us at \nCultureStew\n@MSMGlobalConsulting.com\n\u00a0TODAY!\u00a0\nCONTENT FOR YOUR DOWN TIME\nHere are some recommended articles and books for your down time.\n \nBlack Panther Woman\n: The Political and Spiritual Life of \nEricka Huggins\n (Black Power)\nBy\u00a0\n\u00a0\nMary Frances Phillips\nEricka Huggins\u2019 Black Panther Woman is a testament to the resilience, leadership, and revolutionary spirit of Black women in the fight for justice. As a key figure in the Black Panther Party, Huggins not only challenged racial and social oppression but also redefined the role of Black women in activism, balancing political resistance with spiritual resilience. Her story highlights the often-overlooked contributions of Black women in shaping movements, fostering community, and leading with both strength and compassion. In a world that seeks to silence them, Huggins\u2019 life is a powerful reminder that Black women are, and always have been, at the forefront of change.\nThe Witch Boy\nBy \nMolly Knox Ostertag\u00a0\nMolly Knox Ostertag\u2019s The Witch Boy is a powerful tale of identity and self-discovery that can resonate deeply with transgender and gender-nonconforming readers. The main character, Aster, struggles against rigid gender roles, where boys must be shapeshifters and girls are witches, mirrors the experience of those who defy societal expectations to embrace their true selves. His journey is a testament to the courage it takes to live authentically, showing young readers that identity is personal, not prescribed.

Kira was healthy, but after the delivery, she started showing signs of internal bleeding. Charles kept asking the medical team for help, but for more than 10 hours, his concerns were dismissed. At one point, a doctor said to him, \u201cSir, your wife is not a priority right now\u201d. By the time she was finally taken into surgery, it was too late\u2014Kira passed away from a hemorrhage that could have been prevented. Her death is one of far too many, as Black women in the U.S. are nearly three times more likely to die from pregnancy-related complications than white women.\nAfter losing Kira, Charles founded \n4Kira4Moms\n (\n4kira4moms.com\n) to honor her memory and drive change in maternal healthcare. Through awareness campaigns, education, and legislative efforts, he\u2019s helped pass key policies like the \nPreventing Maternal Deaths Act of 2018\n and the \nProtecting Moms Who Served Act of 2021\n. He\u2019s also a leading voice in the push for the \nBlack Maternal Health Momnibus Act\n, which takes a more comprehensive approach to addressing disparities in maternal care.\nIf you're interested, here\u2019s a bit more about the organization Charles founded: \n4Kira4Moms \u2013 Who We Are\n. Kira\u2019s story is a painful but powerful example of how bias in healthcare can have real, life-or-death consequences. \nI really appreciated our discussion today, and this was a story that came to mind as a real-world illustration of why this work is absolutely essential. \nThanks again for such a powerful session \u2013 I hope we can stay connected.\nAll my best,\nLaura (the \u201cneedlepointer\u201d \n\ud83d\ude09\n )\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\nLaura Ladi\n\u00a0\n(she/her/hers)\nSpencer Stuart\n\u00a0San Francisco\nT\u00a0415-808-8909\u00a0| M\u00a0858-229-4355\nRead our latest insights on leading at the top,\u00a0\nLeadership for a Complex World: Planning for the CEO of the Future\n\u00a0\nThis message is a private communication.

    "body": "Hi Larry,\nI wanted to thank you again for such a thoughtful and engaging session on uncovering bias. It was incredibly powerful, and I know I\u2019ll be approaching candidate screens with a much more intentional mindset. I can promise you this\u2014I\u2019ll never let \u201cculture fit\u201d go unquestioned again without asking, \u201cWhat did you mean by that?\u201d Those two short hours truly shifted my perspective, and I\u2019m so grateful to you for that. \nAs promised, I wanted to share more about \nthe story of Charles Johnson and his wife, Kira,\n and the work Charles is doing since Kira\u2019s passing.\nIn 2016, Charles and Kira went to Cedars-Sinai for what should have been a routine C-section to welcome their second child. Kira was healthy, but after the delivery, she started showing signs of internal bleeding. Charles kept asking the medical team for help, but for more than 10 hours, his concerns were dismissed. At one point, a doctor said to him, \u201cSir, your wife is not a priority right now\u201d. By the time she was finally taken into surgery, it was too late\u2014Kira passed away from a hemorrhage that could have been prevented. Her death is one of far too many, as Black women in the U.S. are nearly three times more likely to die from pregnancy-related complications than white women.\nAfter losing Kira, Charles founded \n4Kira4Moms\n (\n4kira4moms.com\n) to honor her memory and drive change in maternal healthcare. Through awareness campaigns, education, and legislative efforts, he\u2019s helped pass key policies like the \nPreventing Maternal Deaths Act of 2018\n and the \nProtecting Moms Who Served Act of 2021\n. He\u2019s also a leading voice in the push for the \nBlack Maternal Health Momnibus Act\n, which takes a more comprehensive approach to addressing disparities in maternal care.\nIf you're interested, here\u2019s a bit more about the organization Charles founded: \n4Kira4Moms \u2013 Who We Are\n. Kira\u2019s story is a painful but powerful example of how bias in healthcare can have real, life-or-death consequences. \nI really appreciated our discussion today, and this was a story that came to mind as a real-world illustration of why this work is absolutely essential. \nThanks again for such a powerful session \u2013 I hope we can stay connected.\nAll my best,\nLaura (the \u201cneedlepointer\u201d \n\ud83d\ude09\n )\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\nLaura Ladi\n\u00a0\n(she/her/hers)\nSpencer Stuart\n\u00a0San Francisco\nT\u00a0415-808-8909\u00a0| M\u00a0858-229-4355\nRead our latest insights on leading at the top,\u00a0\nLeadership for a Complex World: Planning for the CEO of the Future\n\u00a0\nThis message is a private communication.

(White House photo) \nWhy is the Administration Cancelling Religion?\nDear Larry Baker,\u00a0\nThe Trump administration is \nremoving\n Diversity, Equality, and Inclusion (DEI) programs from government agencies. Critics of DEI rightly\u00a0\nargue\n that these initiatives can sometimes prioritize surface-level diversity over merit, leading to hiring and promotions based more on identity than qualifications.\nMeanwhile, President Donald Trump established a White House Faith Office tasked with safeguarding religious communities. Its \nresponsibilities include\n \nidentifying instances where the executive branch fails to uphold constitutional and federal protections for religious liberty.\nKnow someone impacted? Please click and share my full article.\n \nThrowing the Religious Baby Out With the DEI Bathwater\n \nOne unintended consequence of eliminating DEI programs has been the negative impact on religious liberty. As federal agencies discontinued their DEI initiatives, many faith-based programs for government employees, which were supported by DEI, were also shut down.\nPrograms I have personally engaged with, such as outreach trips by the U.S. Naval Academy Gospel Choir and employee resource groups (ERGs) within agencies like the \nU.S. Department of State\n, have been canceled. These initiatives were made possible through DEI, and without it, they no longer exist. \nThis is a failure to uphold protections for religious liberty - and America's corporations are taking note.\u00a0\n \nFortune 500 companies are noticing the Administration\u2019s cancellation of DEI and its impact on religious initiatives. As a result, some corporations are feeling pressure to eliminate religious programs along with DEI efforts. \nHow Faith-Based Employee Groups and Faith-Friendly Workplaces Support Religious Freedom\n \nIn today\u2019s diverse workforce, religious freedom is essential for creating an inclusive and respectful work environment. Faith-based employee resource groups (ERGs) and faith-friendly workplace initiatives play a crucial role in supporting religious expression, fostering mutual understanding, and ensuring that employees of all faiths\u2014and those without religious beliefs\u2014feel valued and respected.\nThese initiatives not only strengthen workplace culture but also promote a sense of belonging for all employees. For many American workers, faith-based ERGs provide their primary source of religious fellowship. For example, a\u00a0recent national \nstudy\n of Jewish workers found that \nfor 24% of Jewish employees, their company\u2019s ERG is their main connection to Jewish life\n (see chart). This highlights the significant role these groups play in fostering identity, community and freedom of religious expression in the workplace.\u00a0\n \nThe Price of Religious Freedom Denied is $Trillions\n \nAmerica\u2019s success is significantly driven by the active contributions of religious communities. In fact, religion generates nearly \n$1.2 trillion\n in socio-economic value for the U.S. economy each year\u2014equivalent to the world\u2019s 15th largest national economy, surpassing roughly 180 other countries.\u00a0 \nTo uphold this vital economic and social asset, the Administration\u2019s America First agenda should reconsider policies that weaken this unique strength of the nation.\n \nThe socio-economic impact of religion in the U.S.\nPlease click and share my full article.\n \nCheck out related resources and new articles below.\nBrian Grim\nPresident\nReligious Freedom & Business Foundation \nIn the News\n \n \nIn some of the United States' largest companies, religious affinity groups\u2014formed by employees of various faiths\u2014serve as spaces for dialogue and advocacy. U.S. employers are required to accommodate employees' religious practices. By Alexis Buisson. \nRead more\n. \nResearch\n \n \nMany workplace leaders avoid addressing religion explicitly for fear of conflict. But Ecklund, Daniels, and Scheitle argue that ignoring religion\u2019s presence at work can cause more harm than good. This is the case because many employees\u00a0\nwant\n\u00a0to express or practice their faith at work as part of bringing their authentic selves to work, and they feel excluded or stifled if discouraged from doing so. \nRead more\n.\u00a0 \nThe Power of Jewish ERGs: Findings From Clal\u2019s Research Report, Jewish at Work 2024\n \n \nDemand for Jewish ERGs is Growing: The movement for Jewish ERGs is gaining momentum, with 46% of new members joining since October 7, 2023. For 24% of participants, their company\u2019s ERG is their primary connection to Jewish life\u2014a powerful testament to the role these groups play in fostering identity and belonging. \nRead more\n. \nStay in touch:\n \n \n \n \n \n \nCopyright \u00a9 2025 Religious Freedom & Business Foundation, All rights reserved.\n \nLatest data and news from Brian Grim \nOur mailing address is:\n \nReligious Freedom & Business Foundation\n1A Perry Circle\nAnnapolis\n, \nMD\n \n21402\nAdd us to your address book\nWant to change how you receive these emails?\nYou can \nupdate your preferences\n or \nunsubscribe from this list\n. \n\u2007\ufeff\u034f \u2007\ufeff\u034f \u2007\ufeff\u034f \u2007\ufeff\u034f\u2007\ufeff\u034f \u2007\ufeff\u034f \u2007\ufeff\u034f \u2007\ufeff\u034f\u2007\ufeff\u034f \u2007\ufeff\u034f \u2007\ufeff\u034f \u2007\ufeff\u034f\u2007\ufeff\u034f \u2007\ufeff\u034f \u2007\ufeff\u034f \u2007\ufeff\u034f\u2007\ufeff\u034f \u2007\ufeff\u034f \u2007\ufeff\u034f \u2007\ufeff\u034f\u2007\ufeff\u034f \u2007\ufeff\u034f \u2007\ufeff\u034f \u2007\ufeff\u034f",

We had the idea of getting a shared leash and walking them when we stopped for gas.\nIt went so poorly. Phat Steve and Skunk Monkey took off in opposite directions, then both dropped to the ground. It was equal parts hilarious and annoying.\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n \n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\nWe can look at misalignment in the workplace the same way. It\u2019s what happens when teams, leaders, and strategies aren\u2019t working together. Progress stops and frustration begins.\nStrong alignment doesn\u2019t just \nhappen\n by luck\u2014it takes intention, communication, and follow-through.\nSo, how do you start?\nGet clear on your organization\u2019s goals and expected outcomes.\nBreak down silos with cross-functional check-ins.\nKeep feedback flowing.\nTo learn more about aligning HR and TA with business strategy, check out \nmy recent webinar\n \nfrom the Australasian Talent Conference (ATC).\n(And no\u2014Phat Steve and Skunk Monkey never did learn to work together while on the leash.)\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n \n\u00a0\n\u00a0\nfrom\u00a0Rebecca Warren\nDirector of Talent-centered Transformation, Eightfold AI\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\nStatic systems aren\u2019t a lucky strategy. AI is.\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\nLately, HR and talent leaders keep asking me the same question: \nHow do I handle the rise of agentic AI workers\n?\nThe reality is that work in the future won\u2019t look remotely similar to work today. \nThe latest report from The Josh Bersin Company, \nThe Rise of the Superworker\n, highlights how employees working alongside AI agents are reshaping the workforce, and why agility in systems and strategy is critical.\nThe organizations that will succeed are strategically stepping away from static systems and fixed processes and creating new ways of working with AI.\nRead our top takeaways\n about how AI is shaping the next era of work.\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n \n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n \n\u00a0\n\u00a0\nfrom Jenny\u00a0Cotie Kangas\nDirector of Talent-centered Transformation,\u00a0\nEightfold AI\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\nThe right questions make HR data \nmore powerful.\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\nIn your quest to be data-driven, you also need to be data-literate. This means being intentional about how you\u2019re acquiring data and using it to support your organization.\nHR leaders should ask of their data:\nHow can I tell a story with this information?\nWhat opportunity does this data give me to influence or coach my colleagues?\nWho is the right audience, or where is the biggest audience for this data?\nWhat can the data NOT do?\nKnowing the ground rules up front plays a major role in building trust and elevates the conversation from transactional to strategic.\nListen to this \nconversation\n on data and people analytics from The Josh Bersin Company to get a sense of how you can use your data to get ahead.\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n \n\u00a0\n\u00a0\nfrom Teresa Wykes\nSenior Director of Talent-centered Transformation, Eightfold AI\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\nIn other talent news...\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n2025 AI business predictions\n: Your success with AI will be as much about vision as adoption.

Rethink \u201cProductivity\u201d\nNot everyone thrives in the \n9-to-5, desk-bound\n work model. Some employees do their best thinking in \nshort bursts\n. Others need \nflexible schedules\n to align with their cognitive rhythms.\u00a0\n\u2705\n \nStrategy:\n Offer flexible work options\u2014remote work, varied work hours, and project-based deadlines instead of rigid time blocks.\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\ud83d\udcac\n \n2. Communication Styles Matter\nNeurodivergent employees may process verbal, written, or visual communication \ndifferently\n. One person might struggle with \nlong, detailed emails\n, while another might find \nface-to-face conversations overwhelming\n.\u00a0\n\u2705\n \nStrategy:\n Ask employees \nhow they prefer to receive and share information.\n Use multiple formats\u2014written summaries, bullet points, voice notes, or even quick check-ins\u2014to support diverse communication needs.\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\ud83c\udfe2\n \n3. Create Sensory-Friendly Workspaces\nOpen offices, \nharsh lighting\n, and constant noise can be \noverstimulating\n for neurodivergent employees. These distractions can \ntank productivity\n and make it hard to focus.\u00a0\n\u2705\n \nStrategy:\n Offer \nquiet workspaces, noise-canceling headphones, adjustable lighting, or remote work options\n to create ways for employees to do their best work.\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\ud83d\udee0\ufe0f\n \n4. Adjust Expectations Around Meetings\nTraditional meetings can be draining for neurodivergent employees\u2014especially those who need \nmore processing time\n or struggle with \nverbal brainstorming on the spot\n.\u00a0\n\u2705\n \nStrategy:\n\ud83d\udd39\n \nProvide agendas in advance\n so employees can prepare.\n\ud83d\udd39\n Allow for \nwritten contributions\n for those who think better through text.\n\ud83d\udd39\n Consider \nshorter, structured meetings\n to avoid unnecessary cognitive overload.\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\ud83c\udfaf\n \n5. Focus on Strengths, Not Deficits\nInstead of expecting neurodivergent employees to \nfit into existing structures\n, shape their roles around \nwhat they do best.\n\u00a0\n\u2705\n \nStrategy:\n Identify and \nleverage their unique skills\n\u2014whether it\u2019s pattern recognition, deep focus, problem-solving, or creativity\u2014and align them with tasks that amplify those strengths.\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\ud83c\udfa4\n \nWhat\u2019s Next? \nThese changes \ndon\u2019t require a complete workplace overhaul\n\u2014just \nsmall, intentional shifts\n that can unlock \ngame-changing potential\n in your team.\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\ud83d\ude80\n \nReady to Build a More Inclusive Workplace?\nSchedule a complimentary call with me, and let\u2019s craft a strategy for a more inclusive, engaged workforce.\n\ud83d\udcc5\n \nBook Your Strategy Session\u00a0Now\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\nHere\u2019s to creating workplaces where\u00a0all individuals can be their best!\nBye for now,\u00a0\nLuiza\n___________________________________\n\u00a0\nLuiza Dreasher, President and CEO (she/her/hers)\nMastering Cultural Differences\u00a0\nI work with leaders who want to create a work environment where all employees feel valued and want to stay.\nAt \nMastering Cultural Differences LLC,\n we are committed to helping organizations build inclusive, culturally competent workplaces where every individual feels valued and respected.

Here are five strategies to help you run better meetings starting today:\nDefine the purpose\nEvery meeting should have a clear goal. Without one, it\u2019s easy to lose focus and waste time.\nShare agendas ahead of time\nAn agenda helps everyone come prepared, fostering more meaningful discussions and quicker decisions.\nFoster collaboration\nGive everyone a chance to contribute. Meetings should spark ideas and align participants, not just be one-sided presentations.\nStay on schedule\nRespect everyone\u2019s time by sticking to the planned duration and agenda. Time-block discussions to keep things moving efficiently.\nEnd with actionable next steps\nWrap up every meeting by clearly defining takeaways, owners, and deadlines to turn talk into action.\nEfficient meetings can transform your workflows and help you accomplish more. Ready to implement these strategies and see the difference for yourself?\nStart booking meetings\n \n \n \n \n \n \n115 E.

She is the Global Head of People and Culture at Roche and founder of\n \nFlip It to Test It\n,\n a favorite tool for managing bias that is highlighted in most of my courses. She just released her newest \nTedTalk: Why is it that so many people just 'can't get it together'\n? and I could not be more excited to support her as an ally.\nI don't share this a lot publicly. My four-year old daughter, Dylan, has autism. We got her official diagnosis when she turned three, and it has been a huge journey to learning how to be an ally for someone I love more than anything. I have been focused on learning how to communicate with her, accepting and embracing how she interacts with the world and educating others on autism (there are a lot of misperceptions out there).\nFor this reason, Kristen's TedTalk hit home for me. The members of her family have recently been diagnosed with ADHD. She realized that, by not working under the assumption everyone\u2019s brains worked the same way, she could be a better ally to her own family members. \nShe realized that her family member\u2019s brains seemed to be on a different operating system and she had to engage very differently; in doing so, the advantages of their brains became more evident. To engage differently, she began to ask questions like the following:\nInstead of, \u201cWhy can\u2019t they get it together?\u201d she asked, \u201cWhat else might be causing the perception that they 'can't get it together'?\"\nInstead of, \u201cWhy do they procrastinate?\u201d she asked, \u201cWhat might be happening inside their brain to make getting started so challenging?\"\nInstead of, \u201cHow can I fix them?\u201d she asked, \u201cWhat can I learn from them?\u201d and \"What can I adapt in my approach to bring out the best in them?\"\nInstead of seeing all the ways in which people with neurodivergence \u201cdon\u2019t measure up\u201d to a neurotypical standard, brain friends or allies \u201cflip it\u201d to see the advantages divergent brains can bring. \nI interviewed Kristin about this topic on my podcast as well.\n\u200b\nI love Kristen's ideas to be better allies to folks with the neurodivergent community. \nApril is Autism Acceptance Month\n. If you or your team has yet plan an event or share content on how to be an ally to the autistic community, we have ideas. \nMy team \nwould love to chat with you!\n\u200b\nThanks allies,\nJulie\n\u200b\n\ud83d\udcac \nAllyship Conversation Starters & Resources\nIt's Women's History Month and\n \nInternational Women's Day\n \nis quickly approaching!

And we tend to fare\u2014and feel\u2014better when the version we bring is our most authentic self.\nPeople from marginalized social groups might still fear the consequences of revealing too much about themselves. But certain conditions can make them feel more comfortable doing so, according to Kellogg\u2019s \nCynthia Wang\n. That\u2019s this week.\nPlus, in a historical first, organizations have a workforce spanning six generations. What will it take to lead them?\nKeeping it real\u2014under the right circumstances\nFear of social rejection or other forms of backlash present a dilemma for many employees from marginalized groups: Should I risk bringing my true self to work\u2014by wearing a natural hairstyle, for instance, or sharing my love of Black musicians? Or should I play it safe by downplaying this part of myself?\nNew research from Cynthia Wang, a clinical professor of management and organizations, proposes that Black employees\u2019 hesitation to express their true selves is often rooted in uncertainty about how their coworkers will react.\nAcross a series of studies and interviews, Wang and her colleagues identified two factors that helped address this uncertainty and made Black employees feel more comfortable expressing their social identities at work. The first factor was working in an organization with a climate that fosters authenticity, allowing all employees to express their true selves. The second was perspective-taking\u2014the practice of imagining the world from others\u2019 viewpoints.\n\u201cThese factors are critical pieces of the overall puzzle in understanding how to successfully manage diversity within the workplace,\u201d she says. \u201cThey can foster organizational involvement and reduce turnover.\u201d\nWang offers a caveat to the findings. Though taking the time to consider their coworkers\u2019 perspective can be helpful to Black employees, the onus shouldn\u2019t be just on them to spend the extra time and effort it takes to do so.\nRead more in \nKellogg Insight\n.\n \nPreparing for a \u201c6G\u201d reality\nAs teenagers from the emerging Generation Alpha prepare for summer jobs and high school internships, many workplaces now span six generations. The other five: the Silent Generation, Baby Boomers, Generation X, Generation Y (often called Millennials), and Generation Z.\nKellogg\u2019s \nNicholas Pearce\n, a clinical professor of management and organizations, writes that this moment presents a unique opportunity for organizations to reposition themselves as the employer-of-choice for every generation.\nPearce writes that multigenerational teams often clash over matters like what constitutes \u201chard work\u201d or \u201cgood leadership.\u201d He advises organizations to view generations as cultures with differences that should be understood and appreciated.\n\u201cViewing generations as cultures can help leaders foster inclusive environments of mutual respect, honor, and inclusion in which everyone can be their best and bring their best every day,\u201d Pearce said. \u201c[It] can help teammates of different generations productively engage with one another without an underlying sense of cultural\u2014or generational\u2014superiority.\u201d\nAnother challenge he says leaders must confront is the congestion in the talent pipeline, with the more-seasoned workers holding on to top positions rather than retiring, and the younger workers waiting their turn for advancement that\u2019s slow to come.\n\u201cOne of the most pressing opportunities to decongest the talent pipeline is to create meaningful opportunities for senior talent to remain engaged in post-executive roles,\u201d Pearce writes. \u201cSuch positions must include more than honorific titles, be positioned as a positive step forward instead of a step aside (or a step back), and carry real value in transferring knowledge, sharing experiences and expertise, and mentoring younger colleagues without the weight and time commitment of executive-level responsibility.\u201d\nRead more from Pearce in \nHarvard Business Review\n.\n\u201cIn absence of the clear vision of increasing productivity [with AI], people are legitimately scared that the organization may justify laying them off by saying AI can do this job.\u201d\n\u2014 \nHatim Rahman\n, in \nThe Washington Post\n, on a new survey showing that a majority of American workers feel pessimistic about AI on the job.\nSee you next week,\nLaura Pavin, multimedia editor\nKellogg Insight\nFollow us on \nLinkedIn\n.\nAnd listen to our \npodcasts\n.\nKellogg School of Management\n | \n2211 Campus Drive\n, \nEvanston, IL 60208\n \nUnsubscribe larry@lcwmail.com\n \nUpdate Profile\n | \nConstant Contact Data Notice\n \nSent by \ninsight@kellogg.northwestern.edu",

His second term marks a dramatic departure from established norms, as sweeping policy shifts challenge the very foundations of our political system. Abandoned commitments to federal employees, sudden international withdrawals, and drastic funding freezes all point to a deliberate effort to consolidate power. Such actions are not mere policy adjustments; they constitute a fundamental assault on the constitutional principles that have long guided the nation, while undermining democratic stability and trust in democratic institutions.\nTo learn more, check out this \nblog\n.\nRead Blog\n \nPrefer video to text?

Thank you Dr. Gleb!\"\nKiki Orski\n, Program Organizer at Long Island SHRM\nSchedule a Free Consultation\n \nWhat's Up With Me\nWhen I think about our political system, I approach it from the perspective of my expertise: making good decisions. I know that individual humans are flawed and we regularly fall for cognitive biases. We make mistakes all the time in our thinking, and that's why institutions are so important. They provide the checks and balances, the external perspective, which research on debiasing suggests are so needed to correct for our biases. Yet such institutions only work if politicians across the political spectrum cooperate on supporting these institutions. Institutions benefit everyone, yet individual politicians can get ahead by defecting against them. Such defection, if unpunished, creates a race to the bottom, undermining a common understanding of truth and a shared commitment to civility. My hope is that we can find our way to truth and civility, defend our institutions, and rebuild trust.\nWould love to get your feedback on what you found most useful about this edition of the \u201cWise Decision Maker Guide\u201d - simply reply to this email.\nDecisively Yours,\nDr. Gleb\nDr. Gleb Tsipursky\nCEO of Disaster Avoidance Experts\nPS: Are we connected on LinkedIn?

One team member, brilliant in problem-solving, often misses deadlines. Another employee, incredibly detail-oriented, gets overwhelmed in brainstorming sessions. Despite their unique strengths, they seem to be \u201cunderperforming.\u201d\u00a0\nBut what if the real issue isn\u2019t \ntheir performance\n\u2014but how your workplace accommodates \ndifferent ways of thinking\n?\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\ud83e\udd14\n \nThe Experience:\nImagine being an employee with ADHD, expected to work in an open office full of distractions. Or an autistic professional asked to \"just speak up more\" in meetings when they process information differently. A dyslexic team member might have groundbreaking ideas but struggles with written communication.\u00a0\nInstead of\u00a0feeling\u00a0\nsupported\n, these employees often believe they have to \nmask their differences\n\u2014which leads to stress, burnout, and disengagement.\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u26a0\ufe0f\n \nThe Problem:\nNeurodivergent employees are leaving\u2014or never applying\u2014because workplaces aren\u2019t built for them. In fact, many leaders still believe \u201cone-size-fits-all\u201d productivity models work. They don\u2019t.\u00a0\nYour company could be losing out on \ninnovation, creative problem-solving, and unique perspectives\n by not embracing neurodiversity.\u00a0\nWhen neurodivergent employees \ndon\u2019t feel valued, they disengage.\n And disengagement isn\u2019t just an HR issue\u2014it\u2019s a \nbusiness risk\n. Low retention, high turnover costs, and a lack of truly diverse thinking hold companies back from real progress.\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\ud83d\udca1\n \nThe Future You\u2019re Waiting For:\nImagine a workplace where:\n\u2705\n \nMeetings accommodate different communication styles.\n\u2705\n \nWorkspaces are designed to minimize distractions for focused thinking.\n\u2705\n \nEmployees are valued for their strengths\u2014not penalized for differences.\n\u00a0\nWhen neurodivergent employees feel \nempowered, not excluded\n, they \nthrive\n\u2014bringing \ncreativity, innovation, and fresh perspectives\n that drive business success.\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\ud83c\udfa4\n \nWhat\u2019s Next:\nIn my next email, I\u2019ll share \nspecific, actionable strategies\n to make your workplace \nmore inclusive for neurodivergent talent\n\u2014without major overhauls or unrealistic expectations.\u00a0\n\ud83d\udce9\n \nStay tuned for Part 2!\n It\u2019s time to stop overlooking \nneurodivergent brilliance\n and start unlocking \ntrue potential\n in your organization.\u00a0\n\u00a0\u00a0\nBye for now,\u00a0\nLuiza\n___________________________________\n\u00a0\nLuiza Dreasher, President and CEO (she/her/hers)\nMastering Cultural Differences\u00a0\nI work with leaders who want to create a work environment where all employees feel valued and want to stay.\nAt \nMastering Cultural Differences LLC,\n we are committed to helping organizations build inclusive, culturally competent workplaces where every individual feels valued and respected.

While hybrid and remote work are overwhelmingly preferred, nearly a quarter of respondents experienced return-to-office mandates in the past year. An emerging trend, dubbed \"hushed hybrid,\" allows employees to work remotely with their manager's quiet approval, despite official mandates. However, career experts advocate open communication about flexible work instead of relying on covert arrangements. Companies like Kforce are capitalizing on the demand for flexibility, embracing remote-first hybrid models as a competitive advantage for attracting and retaining talent. Experts warn that rigid return-to-office policies could alienate employees who prioritize flexibility, growth, and work-life balance.\nDr. Gleb\u2019s Take\nForcing workers back to the office is a strategic misstep in today\u2019s workplace. The data is clear: employees value flexibility and will leave if denied it. \u201cHushed hybrid\u201d arrangements are a symptom of misaligned leadership that prioritizes outdated norms over results. Organizations like Kforce, which embrace flexibility, are reaping the rewards of higher retention and increased talent acquisition. Leaders need to adapt. The future of work is hybrid, and clinging to traditional office models is a losing strategy. Focus on output, empower your employees with autonomy, and stop micromanaging where and how work gets done. Those who fail to evolve will hemorrhage talent to competitors who understand the value of modern workplace flexibility.\n\u201c\nEmployees should not bear the sole responsibility for learning in remote work\n\u201d (Phys.org)\nSummary\nA study by the University of Eastern Finland highlights significant challenges in remote learning and professional development. Employees in remote work environments often juggle online training alongside other tasks, leading to superficial learning outcomes. Many organizations rely on lecture-heavy content, offering certificates of participation rather than fostering deep learning or practical application. The study also revealed that remote work weakens social bonds and trust, which are essential for innovation and learning. Structured, content-heavy meetings overshadow spontaneous, informal interactions\u2014where new ideas often emerge. To address these issues, the study advocates for targeted training aligned with actual skill needs, diverse interactive methods, and opportunities for reflection and experimentation. It also calls for enabling informal encounters to sustain innovation and community trust.\nDr. Gleb\u2019s Take\nThis study exposes a glaring failure in how organizations approach remote learning. Expecting employees to independently manage learning in a busy remote work environment is shortsighted and counterproductive. Without proper support and relevance, training becomes a box-ticking exercise that wastes time and resources. Leaders need to shift from a behaviorist model of information transfer to a constructivist approach that values engagement, discussion, and social interaction. This requires a deliberate investment in designing training that aligns with employees\u2019 real needs and work contexts. Whenever I design training programs, remote or in-person, I focus on such engagement and social peer interaction, which is vital for adult learning. Moreover, the erosion of social bonds in remote work is a red flag. Innovation thrives on trust and spontaneous collaboration. Leaders must create spaces for informal interactions\u2014even in remote settings\u2014to maintain a strong sense of community. Ignoring these principles risks not only stifling innovation but also alienating the very talent organizations need to succeed in a competitive environment.\n\"\nNeed a Good Night's Sleep? Try Changing How You Think About It\n\" (BBC)\nSummary\nThis article examines how mindset influences sleep quality and perception. It highlights that our beliefs about sleep can shape how rested we feel, often more than the actual hours of sleep logged. For example, individuals who believe they slept poorly may feel more tired, even when their sleep was adequate by objective measures. Overemphasis on sleep quality can create anxiety, perpetuating a cycle of insomnia. Research shows that strategies like cognitive reframing, focusing on enjoyable activities, and letting go of rigid sleep expectations can improve how refreshed people feel, regardless of actual sleep duration.\nDr. Gleb\u2019s Take\nThe sleep industry thrives on fearmongering, creating rigid norms about \u201cperfect sleep\u201d that are not only unrealistic but harmful. Sleep is highly individual, influenced by mindset, circumstances, and environment. Overemphasizing metrics like total hours or rigid sleep hygiene can backfire, fueling anxiety and worsening outcomes. The truth is that you don\u2019t need perfect sleep to function well. What matters more is your perception and how you approach your day. Stop obsessing over your smartwatch\u2019s sleep data and start focusing on things you enjoy. Build resilience by embracing the idea that a less-than-perfect night doesn\u2019t have to ruin your day. This mindset shift isn\u2019t just empowering\u2014it\u2019s the key to breaking free from toxic sleep narratives.\nWhat did you think of my take on these articles?

    "body": "Insights & Information to Help Organizations and\nTheir People Thrive\nFEBRUARY 27, 2025\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \nIn just a few days, Blue Beyond officially \njoins BDO USA\n, embarking on an exciting new chapter. As we move forward, our commitment to building \nDeep Trust and High Expectations\u00ae\n cultures remains at the heart of everything we do \u2014 where deep trust fuels collaboration, and high expectations drive performance.\u00a0\nDeep trust is the foundation of strong teams and cultures. It creates an environment where people feel safe to share ideas, collaborate openly, and take risks without fear. It fosters connection, belonging, and the confidence to innovate. But trust alone isn\u2019t enough.\nHigh expectations ensure that trust translates into results. It means setting clear goals, challenging people to adopt a growth mindset and stretch their capabilities, and holding teams accountable to excellence. Without deep trust, high expectations can feel rigid or overwhelming. Without high expectations, trust can become complacency.\nWhen leaders cultivate both, they unlock the full potential of their teams \u2014 creating workplaces where people feel supported and empowered to share ideas and take risks while also being challenged to grow and contribute at their highest potential.\nThis aligns powerfully with \nBDO\u2019s core purpose\n\u00a0\u2014 helping people thrive, every day. Together, we will continue equipping leaders with the strategies, tools, and insights to build high-performing teams and cultures, ensuring that both the business and the people flourish.\nThank you for being a part of our Blue Beyond journey\u00a0\n\u2014\u00a0\nand we look forward to connecting with you as part of BDO USA!\u00a0\nSincerely,\nCheryl Fields Tyler\nFounder and CEO\nEmail me\n \n\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \nWatch the Webinar: Winning on the People Side of Business: Research, Insights, and Recommendations\nTo learn what it takes to thrive in 2025, watch this webinar recording where we delve into the 8 major findings from our latest research study.\n \nWatch Now \n\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \nFeatured: Why Deep Trust and High Expecations\u00ae Cultures are Key to Organizational Success\nWorking together in an elevating, virtuous cycle, \nDeep Trust and High Expectations\u00ae\n sustainably unleashes organizational potential, agility, and business results \u2014 and in a way that is deeply fulfilling for the people in the organization.\u00a0\nLearn More \n\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \nLeading Insights: News & Notes\n \nIn this episode of \nIntentional Leaders Podcast\n, host Cyndi Wentland engages in a compelling conversation with our founder and CEO about the intricacies of building a thriving workplace culture, emphasizing the need for both deep trust and high expectations. \nWatch Now\n \nWhat does it take for leaders to strengthen employee well-being?

When power dynamics dictate who speaks and who stays quiet, organizations miss out on diverse perspectives\u2014and that means lost innovation, engagement, and growth.\u00a0\nThe good news is that hierarchy doesn\u2019t have to be a barrier. With intentional strategies, you can create an environment where all employees\u2014regardless of title or background\u2014feel empowered to contribute. Here\u2019s how:\u00a0\n\u00a0\n1\ufe0f\u20e3 \nCultivate a Speak-Up Culture\u00a0\nIn many cultures, openly sharing opinions\u2014especially with senior leaders\u2014may not come naturally. Leaders must intentionally create an environment where all voices are encouraged and valued. A simple prompt like, \n\"I\u2019d love to hear different perspectives on this,\"\n can make a big difference.\u00a0\n\u2705\n \nTip:\n Implement structured meeting formats where every participant knows in advance that they will have an equal opportunity to contribute. This approach prevents dominant voices from taking over and ensures a balanced, inclusive discussion where diverse insights can thrive.\u00a0\n\u00a0\n2\ufe0f\u20e3 \nTrain Leaders to Navigate Diverse Communication Styles\u00a0\nSilence doesn\u2019t always mean agreement\u2014in some cultures, it signifies respect or hesitation. Without this understanding, leaders may misinterpret engagement levels and overlook valuable input.\u00a0\n\u2705\n \nTip:\n Equip leaders with the skills to recognize and adapt to diverse communication styles. Culturally competent leaders \u201cread the room,\u201d foster inclusion, and create space for all voices to be heard.\u00a0\n\u00a0\n3\ufe0f\u20e3 \nImplement Structured Meeting Formats\u00a0\nUnstructured discussions often amplify the loudest voices, leaving others unheard. By using clear frameworks, you create a more inclusive space where every team member has the opportunity to contribute.\u00a0\n\u2705\n \nTip:\n Try the \n\u201c1-2-4-All\u201d technique\n to encourage thoughtful participation at every level:\n\ud83d\udd39\n \n1 min\n \u2013 Reflect individually on the topic.\n\ud83d\udd39\n \n2 min\n \u2013 Discuss ideas with a partner.\n\ud83d\udd39\n \n4 min\n \u2013 Share insights in small groups.\n\ud83d\udd39\n \nAll\n \u2013 Present key takeaways to the larger team.\u00a0\nThis method ensures balanced engagement, fosters diverse perspectives, and prevents discussions from being dominated by a few voices.\u00a0\n\u00a0\n4\ufe0f\u20e3 \nEstablish Meaningful Mentorship Programs\u00a0\nHierarchical structures can make it difficult for employees\u2014especially those in junior roles\u2014to voice their opinions or concerns. A well-designed mentorship program helps bridge this gap by fostering support, guidance, and confidence-building across all levels.\u00a0\n\u2705\n \nTip:\n Create mentorship opportunities that connect culturally diverse team members, encouraging collaboration, shared learning, and mutual support to empower every voice in the organization.\u00a0\n\u00a0\n5\ufe0f\u20e3 \nEmbrace a \u201cCollective Leadership\u201d Approach\u00a0\nFoster a culture where leadership is shared, and every team member feels empowered to contribute\u2014regardless of title or seniority.\u00a0\n\u2705\n \nTip:\n Rotate meeting facilitators to give different team members the opportunity to lead discussions, ensuring diverse perspectives shape decision-making and challenging traditional hierarchical norms.\u00a0\n\u00a0\n6\ufe0f\u20e3 \nCreate Alternative Avenues for Input\u00a0\nEven in the most inclusive environments, some team members may still feel hesitant to voice their opinions in group settings\u2014whether due to cultural norms, personality differences, or past experiences. Great leaders recognize this and provide multiple ways for employees to contribute.\u00a0\n\u2705\n \nTip:\n Encourage one-on-one check-ins where employees can share feedback privately or offer written channels like email or anonymous suggestion forms to gather insights. When leaders actively seek input through different formats, they ensure every voice is valued.\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\ud83d\ude80\n \nReady to Build a Culturally Competent Workplace?\n \u00a0\nLet\u2019s create a strategy tailored to your team\u2019s unique challenges and goals. \u00a0\n\ud83d\udcc5\n \nSchedule a\n\u00a0\ncomplimentary strategy call with me today!\n \u00a0\n\u00a0\nHere\u2019s to breaking barriers and creating more efficient, culturally competent teams!\n\ud83c\udf0d\u2728\n\u00a0\nBye for now,\u00a0\nLuiza\n___________________________________\n\u00a0\nLuiza Dreasher, President and CEO (she/her/hers)\nMastering Cultural Differences\u00a0\nI work with leaders who want to create a work environment where all employees feel valued and want to stay.\nAt \nMastering Cultural Differences LLC,\n we are committed to helping organizations build inclusive, culturally competent workplaces where every individual feels valued and respected.

An opportunity to join our \naudiobook competition\n!\n\u00a0\nClick on the links below to dive deeper into each topic.\n\u00a0\nAs always, we\u2019re here for any questions or additional information you may need.\n\u00a0\nWarm regards,\nYour \nIncluded\n Team \n\u00a0 \nThis Too Shall Pass\nMany colleagues are feeling pretty flat right now. For professionals who have dedicated their lives to combatting injustice and improving people\u2019s well-being, many are understandably scared and weary in equal measure about the events now unfolding in the States. What\u2019s being cooked up in Washington, DC is spilling out around the globe.\nMake no mistake, this is bad. For many, it\u2019s the worst possible scenario.\nYet, at this undeniably challenging time, we need to find sustenance for the journey ahead and there are two things which I believe can help us:\n \nIt\u2019s important that we don\u2019t give in or give up\nWe need to learn to separate the noise from the signal\n\u00a0 \nContinue reading...\n \nIt\u2019s still Black History Month in the US, and it\u2019s still important\nThis past weekend, I went to my local grocery store like I do most weekends. As I was walking to my car in the parking lot, I heard someone shout, \u201cGo back home! We don\u2019t want you, and we don\u2019t need you!\u201d\nIf you\u2019re a person of colour in living in the US, this is likely a familiar experience for you. If you\u2019re Black and living in the US, this is probably something you were taught as a child to expect to hear at some point.\nThis is the reality of life in America. This is why it\u2019s so important to recognise and celebrate Black History Month, even if the federal government has decided not to anymore. This is an opportunity for organisations, and leaders, to step up.\n\u00a0 \nRead now\n \nInclusive Leadership: Driving Performance, Not Just Compliance\nAt \nIncluded\n, we know that inclusive leadership isnt just a \u2018nice to have\u2019 - it\u2019s a business imperative. It strengthens engagement, drives retention, and enables firms to perform at their best. But how do we move beyond compliance-driven inclusion and embed it as a core part of how organisations operate?\nWe explored this in our recent event with leading law firms, where we were joined by Vicki Godfrey, Head of People & Culture at Kingsley Napley. The discussion focused on how law firms are embedding inclusive leadership, the challenges they face, and the opportunities to use regulation as a catalyst for change.\n\u00a0 \nRead our post-session insights\n \nFrom Policy to Progress: How EU Directives Can Drive Culture Change\nWith the Corporate Sustainability Reporting Directive (CSRD) now in effect and the Gender Representation Directive set to go live next year, companies with an EU presence face an evolving regulatory landscape that extends far beyond pay equity and transparency.\nAt the same time, organisations in the UK are finalising their gender pay gap submissions, with encouragement to extend to disability and ethnicity pay gap reporting too. Whilst the US may push back on EDI, the rest of the world pushes forward,\nJoin us for another insightful webinar where, this time, we\u2019ll explore how these EU directives are reshaping workplace expectations and what they mean for your organisation.\n\u00a0 \nSign-up here\n \nUsing Data in EDI: Driving Evidence-Based Inclusion Strategies\nIn today\u2019s data-driven world, harnessing the right insights is key to building inclusive workplaces. But how can law firms effectively use data to inform and enhance their EDI strategies?\nIn this session, discover how to leverage data for meaningful change by:\n\u2022\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Identifying key metrics that reflect inclusion and equity in your organisation\n\u2022\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Using data to measure, monitor, and improve EDI initiatives\n\u2022\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Embedding evidence-based strategies into everyday practices\n\u2022\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Equipping leaders with insights to drive accountability and inclusive growth\n\u00a0 \nSign-up here\n \nBreaking Barriers: Beyond the Hashtags, Beyond IWD\nThe conversation on equity and inclusion cannot be confined to a single day. As Women\u2019s History Month comes to a close, join us for a powerful and thought-provoking session with keynote speaker \nDimple Agarwal\n, a leader and advocate for equity in the workplace.\nIn this session, Dimple will bring to life the realities of workplace culture and discrimination, the barriers to real inclusion, and the urgent need for systemic change. Drawing from her extensive experience, both in the corporate world and supporting individuals facing discrimination, she will challenge the myths of corporate progress and provide tangible actions to accelerate action and drive meaningful change. \n\u00a0 \nSign-up here\n \nThe Key to Inclusion Audiobook\n\u00a0\nWe are delighted to share that our book, \nThe Key to Inclusion\n, is soon to be available in audio format.

faced unstable periods or change, but what makes an organization last is ensuring that decisions during these times are not made out of fear. Unpredictability in external factors and events can influence our organizations and lives in ways we could never imagine sometimes (i.e. covid, changes in government, policy shifts, natural disasters, etc.).\nThese tools will not only help build resilience amongst the leadership but every employee. Even if you believe that you as a leader and your organization are in a stable place, it never hurts to reevaluate how you are connecting with your team. \nThere are three areas of influence that team leaders can work within to reduce overwhelm, confusion, and burnout within their teams and organizations and lead with clarity and confidence. Learn more from our latest \nLinkedIn Newsletter\n for a sneak peek of what will be discussed during the webinar.\nThere is still time to register for the upcoming webinar!\n During the webinar, Natalie Rodgers will dive deeper into tools you can implement to cut through uncertainty and lead your team with clarity.\nUpcoming Webinar: \nTools to Cut Through Uncertainty & Lead Your Team with Clarity\nREGISTER TODAY\nDate: Wed, March 19th\nTime\n: 11AM - 11:30AM CT\n\u00a0\nCopyright (C) 2025 The Acacia Company.

    "subject": "How \u201cartifacts\u201d can define your legacy",
    "body": "Plus: finding the right investors. \nFebruary 26, 2025 \u00a0\u00b7\u00a0 \nView in browser\n \nThe Insightful Leader\nBY \nKELLOGG INSIGHT\nLeadership advice from the Kellogg School of Management at Northwestern University\nGood morning, \nThis week, we look at how family-enterprise leaders can identify \u201cartifacts,\u201d or objects and stories that convey meaning, to transmit the firm\u2019s values across generations.\nWe also have advice for startup founders on how to find funders who share their company\u2019s vision.\nFrom framed dollar bills to inspiring stories\nOne critical aspect of ensuring the success of any family enterprise is the transmission of core values from generation to generation. But according to Kellogg\u2019s \nMatt Allen\n, a clinical professor and executive director of the Ward Center for Family Enterprises, facilitating that continuity can be tough without a defined legacy of the company\u2019s values, especially as those values are likely to evolve from generation to generation.\n\u201cAnytime you have a generational transition in a business, you\u2019ve got different viewpoints on what each feels is important,\u201d says Allen. \u201cDeveloping a legacy that both grounds the company in the past and provides a clear direction for the future can be tricky.\u201d\nSo Allen recommends that leaders use artifacts\u2014verbal, physical, relational, and emotional messages\u2014to help define and transmit the company\u2019s legacy. These can be stories from the company\u2019s history, locales like its first production facility or store location, or objects like a framed dollar bill from a company\u2019s first transaction.\nWhen deciding on what these artifacts could be for your family enterprise, look for emotional connection to the firm\u2019s values, Allen advises. It also helps to be specific enough that it speaks to the family\u2019s history but broad enough that it gives nonfamily employees a guide.\n\u201cWe don\u2019t want to use artifacts that are so specific that they hold you back, that they keep the next generation from moving forward, or become uninspiring,\u201d Allen says.\nRead more in \nKellogg Insight\n.\n \nFind your angels\nLeaders looking to scale startup businesses often have to raise money to realize that growth. Finding the right investors\u2014who can offer more than just cash but can be genuine partners in the company\u2019s vision\u2014can be tricky. Kellogg entrepreneurship professor and serial investor \nJeffrey Eschbach\n has some advice for making the most of your relationships with angels.\nStart by laying the groundwork, from detailing your goals and updating your social media to preparing executive summaries and really crunching the numbers on what you will realistically need to succeed.\n\u201cYou do have to do a little bit of calculating,\u201d Eschbach says. \u201cWhen a founder merely requests funding to extend their operating runway for another 12 months, I worry that they aren\u2019t focused on clear results. I want to know what they plan to achieve\u2014additional revenue targets, improved tech, new partnerships\u2014by spending my investment dollars.\u201d\nEschbach recommends leaning into your existing networks to find potential investors\u2014or advice and introductions from other successful founders. Once you have identified potential investors, it\u2019s critical to keep nurturing the relationships based as much on the angels\u2019 expertise as on their ability to provide funding.\n\u201cThere\u2019s a saying in the funding world, \u2018If you want money, ask for feedback. If you want feedback, ask for money,\u2019\u201d he says.\nWhen building those relationships, it helps to have a clear picture of the funders\u2019 investing history, their approach to mentorship, and their financial expectations for the investor relationship from timelines to returns.\n\u201cEven though you\u2019ll work hard, angel investors need to mentally assume the money\u2019s gone,\u201d Eschbach says. \u201cWith startups, there may never even be an exit, and they have to be 100 percent comfortable with that.\u201d\nRead more in \nKellogg Insight\n.\n\u201c[Financial] advisors are going to become scarce.

EduBirdie recently did an analysis of Google Trends that revealed a staggering 822% surge in searches for \u201ccompanies with DEI\u201d following Trump\u2019s executive orders rolling back anti-discrimination policy. This data signals a strong preference for inclusive workplaces among younger generations. This comes at a critical time, as potential shifts in federal policy threaten to dismantle hard-won DEI gains. While DEI initiatives are not without flaws, abandoning them entirely is not the solution. \nInstead, companies must pivot and strengthen what works, recognizing that discrimination lawsuits far outweigh the risks of defending inclusion. Gen Z, the most diverse generation in U.S. history, is watching closely. \n\u200b\nJoin the ongoing conversation about this article and read more here.\n\u200b\nThanks allies,\nJulie\n\u200b\n\ud83d\udcac \nAllyship Conversation Starters & Resources\n\u200b\nEmployers shouldn\u2019t abandon diversity efforts, SHRM says\n\u200b\n\u200b\n\u200b\nFoot traffic fell at Target after it backtracked on DEI\n \ud83d\udc40\nCare about inclusion for the little ones in your life?

Wells Fargo Securities, Inc. has cast a spotlight on the increasing legal risks companies face when they ignore work-from-home (WFH) requests under the Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA). \nThis landmark case underscores the critical need for employers to understand\n their obligations under the ADA\n, particularly in the evolving landscape of remote work.\nTo learn more, check out this \nblog\n.\nRead Blog\n \nPrefer video to text?

I will use the responses to inform my articles in \nHarvard Business Review\n, \nFortune\n, and \nEntrepreneur\n.\nYour Testimonials\nYou and others who gain value from Disaster Avoidance Experts \nservices\n and thought leadership occasionally share testimonials about your experience, such as the one below. You can read more testimonials \nhere\n.\n\u201cThanks, Dr. Gleb, for a very insightful eLearning Webinar presentation, \u2018Why Do Insurance Professionals Ignore Serious Risks (And What to Do About It).\u2019 \nAttendees were fully engaged\n throughout the event and we appreciate your insights on a very important topic for our community.\u201d\nTricia Stillman\n, \nEducation Program Director, Insurance Accounting & Systems Association\nSchedule a Free Consultation\n \nWhat's Up With Me\nThe mother of a close friend of mine recently suffered a serious medical issue and spent over a week in a hospital. She is generous and kind, and had invited me to her house for Thanksgiving several times, and I in turn hosted her at my house for several parties. Thus, I decided to visit her to provide her with some company and food after she returned home from the hospital (I didn\u2019t visit her in the hospital because I was in Los Angeles at the time).\u00a0\nMy visit wasn\u2019t only out of loyalty to my friend or due to my own feeling of connection to his mother. There was also something else: my desire to have a community when I\u2019m in my 80s, with people visiting me when I am sick or homebound. I try to act in a way that creates the world that I would like to see, and this action was one way of doing so. I brought her some frozen meals, and we spent about an hour talking. I enjoyed the experience more than I expected. So \nconsider taking actions to create a better world, and you might enjoy it more than you expected\n, too.\nWould love to get your feedback on what you found most useful about this edition of the \u201cWise Decision Maker Guide\u201d - simply reply to this email.\nDecisively Yours,\nDr. Gleb\nDr. Gleb Tsipursky\nCEO of Disaster Avoidance Experts\nPS: Are we connected on LinkedIn?

Employees hold back, innovation stalls and diverse perspectives never reach the table.\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u26a0\ufe0f \nThe Problem:\nWhen hierarchical structures clash across cultures, it creates:\n\u274c\n A lack of psychological safety, where employees hesitate to share ideas.\n\u274c\n Power imbalances that reinforce exclusion rather than inclusion.\n\u274c\n Decision-making that leans toward dominant voices, leaving diverse insights unheard.\u00a0\nOrganizations seeking diverse team input often underestimate the influence of cultural hierarchies on participation, unintentionally sidelining valuable perspectives.\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\ud83d\udca1\n The Future You\u2019re Waiting For:\nImagine a workplace where:\n\u2705\n Employees, regardless of title or background, feel empowered to contribute.\n\u2705\n Teams leverage cultural differences as strengths, rather than obstacles.\n\u2705\n Leadership actively fosters an inclusive environment that balances hierarchy with collaboration.\u00a0\nThis future isn\u2019t just possible\u2014it\u2019s essential for thriving in today\u2019s global workforce.\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\ud83c\udfa4\n \u00a0What\u2019s Next:\nIn the next email, I\u2019ll share specific strategies to bridge hierarchy gaps and create an inclusive, psychologically safe global workplace. \u00a0\nKeep an eye on your inbox\u2014you won\u2019t want to miss it!\u00a0\n\ud83d\udd1c\n \nStay tuned for Part 2!\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\nBye for now,\u00a0\nLuiza\n___________________________________\n\u00a0\nLuiza Dreasher, President and CEO (she/her/hers)\nMastering Cultural Differences\u00a0\nI work with leaders who want to create a work environment where all employees feel valued and want to stay.\nAt \nMastering Cultural Differences LLC,\n we are committed to helping organizations build inclusive, culturally competent workplaces where every individual feels valued and respected.

They demonstrated\u00a0how they adapted the curriculum to the Indian context and piloted the curriculum. \nHuman Rights & Business Skills Pilot\nDear Larry Baker,\u00a0\nThis week, I had the tremendous opportunity to observe four of the 10 schools in India that participated in our \u201cHuman Rights & Business Skills\u201d secondary school curriculum \npilot\n. We supplemented the curriculum, which is based on the Universal Declaration of Human Rights and the Indian Constitution, with business skills that reinforce and apply the human rights.\n \nThe MIT-WPU team of student teachers demonstrated four of the 10 human rights lessons that they piloted in the fall: Freedom of Religion, Protection from Child Labor, Right to Marriage and Family, and Freedom from Bullying.\u00a0\nThe next day we visited four schools where each of these lessons were demonstrated. \n \nAt a prep school attached to MIT WPU, the pilot class on Religious Freedom was animated through \u201cgamification\u201d \u2013 using games and competition to motivate learning.\nIn one game, teams competed to see who could find the most similarities between India\u2019s multiple religions. My minor but really fun part was to come on stage and hand out the awards.\n \nThe class teacher at an all-girls Muslim school (pictured above, bottom right), gave a ringing endorsement after the demonstration lesson, Freedom from Bullying. She and the chief school administrator invited us to implement the curriculum on an ongoing basis.\nWe are working towards\u00a0sustainability and expansion of the initiative across India and worldwide through Corporate Social Responsibility (CSR) funding.\u00a0Indian companies must spend a minimum of 2% of their average net profit over the preceding three years on CSR activities.\nRead and see the details here\n \nIf you want to see this in action, join us for our \n6th annual Faith@Work multi-faith conference\n in Washington DC (May 20-22). On the third day, the MIT-WPU professors leading the pilot will give a further report and discuss next steps.\u00a0\nLooking forward to (hopefully) seeing you in Washington DC in May!\nBrian Grim\nRFBF President\nDare to Overcome, Global Chair \n \nRegistration and Sponsorships OPEN!\n \nRFBF helps people in business practice the virtues that faith reinforces through our annual \n\"Dare to Overcome\" Fortune 500 Faith@Work conference\n\u00a0in Washington DC (May 20-22, 2025).

It is very important to research your audience! For example, for high-context cultures, start with a friendly introduction. For low-context cultures, lead with the key message.\u00a0\n\u00a0\n2\ufe0f\u20e3 \nChoose Words That Cross Borders Effectively\nIn other words, avoid slang, idioms, and humor (e.g., \u201cLet\u2019s hit the ground running\u201d might confuse non-native speakers). Aim for using \nclear and neutral language\n that translates well globally. For example, instead of \"ASAP,\" try \"by [specific date & time zone].\"\u00a0\n\u00a0\n3\ufe0f\u20e3 \nFormat for Clarity & Easy Reading\nKeep sentences short and use \nbullet points\n for key details. You should also consider time zones when setting deadlines. For example: \"Please submit by 5 PM EST / 10 PM GMT.\" Another strategy would be to spell out dates. Write \n15 March 2024\n, not 03/15/24, which can be misinterpreted!\n\u00a0\n4\ufe0f\u20e3 \nBe Mindful of Hierarchy & Formality\nSome cultures (e.g., China, France, Mexico, Brazil) expect \ntitles and formality\n in emails, while others (e.g., the U.S., Australia, Sweden) are more casual. When in doubt, \nerr on the side of formality\n (e.g., \u201cDear Mr. Chen\u201d instead of \u201cHey Chen!\u201d).\u00a0\n\u00a0\n5\ufe0f\u20e3 \nAlways Include a Clear Call to Action (CTA)\nDifferent cultures respond differently to urgency. Instead of a demanding \"I need this by tomorrow,\" try, \nCould you provide this by [specific date]? Let me know if you need more time\n. \nAlso,\n d\nepending on the recipient\u2019s cultural orientation, it might be appropriate to summarize the next steps at the end of your email so there\u2019s no confusion.\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\ud83d\udca1\n Ready to Elevate Your Workplace Communication? Let\u2019s Talk!\n\u00a0\nMastering cross-cultural communication isn\u2019t just about writing better emails\u2014it\u2019s about \nbuilding trust, fostering inclusion, and creating a workplace where everyone feels valued.\n\u00a0\n\ud83d\udcc5\n \nSchedule a complimentary strategy call with me today\n and let\u2019s explore how your organization can enhance your global communication strategies.\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\ud83d\udc49\n \n\ud83d\udcc5\n \nBook your complimentary strategy call here.\n\u00a0\nHere\u2019s to hoping your emails bring teams \ntogether\n, not apart! \n\ud83c\udf0f\n\u00a0\nBye for now!\nLuiza\n___________________________________\n\u00a0\nLuiza Dreasher, President and CEO (she/her/hers)\nMastering Cultural Differences\u00a0\nI work with leaders who want to create a work environment where all employees feel valued and want to stay.\nAt \nMastering Cultural Differences LLC,\n we are committed to helping organizations build inclusive, culturally competent workplaces where every individual feels valued and respected.

    "subject": "Is meritocracy a myth?",
    "body": "Plus: learning from \"superstar\" competitors. \nFebruary 19, 2025 \u00a0\u00b7\u00a0 \nView in browser\n \nThe Insightful Leader\nBY \nKELLOGG INSIGHT\nLeadership advice from the Kellogg School of Management at Northwestern University\nGood morning, \nIn the U.S., there\u2019s an ethos that we get our jobs\u2014and the status that accompanies them\u2014as a result of our own hard work and intelligence. There\u2019s a sense that meritocracy is the norm and that we earn our economic and social positions, rather than inherit them.\nBut in taking a closer look at real-world scenarios, Kellogg\u2019s \nLauren Rivera\n finds that the concept of a classless, equal-opportunity society is more myth than reality. More on that this week.\nPlus, what happens when businesses try to compete against \u201csuperstar\u201d companies.\nMilestone as merit\nAs much as the U.S. promotes itself as a land of opportunity, the nation\u2019s economic inequality is now greater in the country than in many other Western industrialized nations, Rivera explains in a \nrecent podcast\n. And rates of social mobility have gone down.\n\u201cIf you look at the very top and the very bottom rungs of the economic radar, they\u2019re particularly sticky,\u201d she says. \u201cChildren born to families at the top or the bottom fifths of income distributions tend to stay on those same rungs as adults. And children from families at the top of the economic hierarchy monopolize access to prestigious universities and high-paying jobs.\u201d\nThis dynamic plays out across young people\u2019s lives\u2014for children two-and-a-half years old through admission into \u201celite\u201d private schools. In new research, Rivera and a colleague examined the admissions processes at elite pre-K-12 schools in six cities to understand how they evaluate children. The processes were ostensibly structured on the basis of fairness and meritocracy.\nThe researchers conducted interviews with the admissions officers and found that the various schools followed a similar approach: They screened applicants based on developmental milestones\u2014the social, cognitive, or physical traits children tend to display at certain ages. And one of the traits they explicitly looked for was whether the child was non-disabled and developing in a typical way.\n\u201cThe amount of overt discrimination on the basis of neurotypicality as well as disability status was shocking in some of the things that people told us,\u201d Rivera says. \u201cSome of our interviewees actually used imagery from the eugenics movement to describe why they were selecting the physical and the cognitive elite that would go on to be a part of these elite communities.\u201d\nIn other words, the process was set up to identify\u2014and exclude\u2014children who were perceived as having or being at risk of any type of disability.\nCatch the full episode in \nThe Inequality Podcast\n.\n \nLearning from superstars\nRegina Wittenberg Moerman\n misses Bed Bath & Beyond.\nThe once\u2013Fortune 500 retailer, famous for its ceiling-high inventory and deep discount coupons, succumbed to bankruptcy in early 2023, partly due to its inability to compete with newer retailers like Amazon.\nAlas, Bed Bath & Beyond\u2019s fate is hardly an anomaly. Bankruptcy can often be tied to competition from \u201csuperstar\u201d businesses, which dominate a market sector due to their size, scale, innovation, and other factors.\nTo understand the impact of a superstar business on other firms in the same sector, Wittenberg Moerman and her colleagues examined the bankruptcy patterns of thousands of publicly listed U.S. firms.\nThey found that, overall, businesses that faced the most competition from superstars were 42 percent more likely to go bankrupt than unexposed firms. But several factors, including firm innovation and access to credit, mitigated this negative effect.\n\u201cBusinesses that don\u2019t figure out how to adjust to superstars are likely to go into bankruptcy,\u201d says Wittenberg Moerman, a Kellogg professor of accounting and information management. \u201cBut if you have or can find protective mechanisms, you may not be affected or may even do well.\u201d\nRead more in \nKellogg Insight\n.\n\u201cSaying you\u2019re going to boycott something does feel like you\u2019re casting a vote that you hope makes a difference down the road. \u2026 What boycotts don\u2019t seem to do is have much of an impact on consumer behavior.\u201d\n\u2014 \nBrayden King\n, in \nUSA Today\n, on boycotting major retailers.\nSee you next week,\nAbraham Kim, senior research editor\nKellogg Insight\nFollow us on \nLinkedIn\n.\nAnd listen to our \npodcasts\n.\nKellogg School of Management\n | \n2211 Campus Drive\n, \nEvanston, IL 60208\n \nUnsubscribe larry@lcwmail.com\n \nUpdate Profile\n | \nConstant Contact Data Notice\n \nSent by \ninsight@kellogg.northwestern.edu",

While it appears that the narrative is shifting towards other priorities in the government, the impact has been felt. My team is getting daily inquiries about the longevity of DEI work or how were shifting our training as a result. The answer I commonly give and will give here is that we will continue to do the work, how we talk about doing the work may shift. Meaning the DEI acronym, because it is so misunderstood and has been highly weaponized and polarized in the news cycle and in politics, may need to shift for us to be able to have the impact we need from the work.\nOne necessary pivot to successfully navigate this imposed turmoil is \nto weave inclusion into every aspect of your employee experience\n. This will have a positive impact on your employees, your customers and those you hope to serve which should also benefit outcomes for your organization like profitability and innovation. And that is 100% legal. To do that, look at every aspect of the employee experience from an inclusive lens\u2026\nRecruiting\n - This is the first impression of your organization to a potential employee. Where are you recruiting from? If they are the same universities or job websites you've always used, consider intentionally switching that up. Help facilitate people from diverse backgrounds providing referrals. 90% of how job openings are filled are through our own networks. Make sure those networks are as broad as possible to reflect those you hope to serve.\nHiring\n - Quotas and mandates have never been legal, while aspirational hiring goals are 100% legal. Making sure you broaden your pool of candidates before you interview is a key best practice to enhancing diversity. Have objective criteria to fairly assess all potential employees and always higher the best candidate for the job.\nOnboarding\n - This is the first impression of a current employee. Increasingly, people decide within the first 90 days if they\u2019re going to stay at an organization or not. If the onboarding time is intentional and inclusive, people are more likely to stay which results in saved attrition cost through lost productivity and training cost.\nPerformance management\n - Another critical part of the employee experience happens with goal setting, performance reviews and promotion decisions. These decisions are often highly subjective and could benefit from having more objective criteria. What does it take for someone to achieve a 'meets expectations' or 'exceeds expectations' review? Is it 100% clear? How are promotion decisions made? Do we consider a broad pool of candidates before deciding?\nSeparations\n - Although a sad reality of the employee experience, this is the last impression an employee has of your organization. If it\u2019s negative, that is likely to spread and other potential employees will know that your culture is not inclusive. Make sure even if you\u2019re losing an employee that they have a positive experience as they move on to their next opportunity. They may be a great referral source for talent in the future. Be sure to measure attrition rates across elements of diversity. Chances are you\u2019re losing diverse talent at a 2 to 3x higher rate.\n\u200b\n\ud83d\udcac \nAllyship Conversation Starters & Resources\nHBR Ideacast Podcast -\n \nIf DEI Programs Aren\u2019t Effective, What Is?\n\u200b\n\u200b\nThe Legal Landscape Around DEI Is Shifting.

Framed as a strategy to reduce the size of the federal workforce and boost efficiency, this decision overlooks a critical consequence: the potential loss of the government\u2019s most experienced and skilled employees. If history is any indication, \nthis sweeping policy could usher in a new wave of resignations that would undermine the very efficiency it seeks to enhance.\nWe don\u2019t have to speculate blindly about what might happen. Just two years ago, President Joe Biden\u2019s more moderate RTO mandate, which tried to increase the amount of time federal staff worked in the office, triggered a substantial increase in turnover rates among senior and skilled employees. A groundbreaking study conducted by Mark Ma and his colleagues at the University of Pittsburgh, using data from Revelio Labs, provides clear evidence of the damage caused by Biden\u2019s RTO announcement. This research not only quantifies the losses but also offers critical insights into the repercussions of Trump\u2019s far more stringent policy.\nTo learn more, check out this \nblog\n.\nRead Blog\n \nPrefer video to text?

Instead, there\u2019s radio silence. When responses do trickle in, they seem hesitant or even tense. You wonder\u2014did I say something wrong?\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\ud83e\udd14\n The Experience:\nThe truth is that a simple email meant to be efficient can be perceived very differently depending on cultural norms. In some cultures, short and direct emails signal professionalism and clarity. In others, they may come across as cold or even rude. \u00a0\nFor example, a one-line email saying \n\"Please send the report by Friday\"\n might be perfectly acceptable when sent to a U.S. colleague but could feel abrupt and dismissive to colleagues in Japan or India, where a more relationship-focused approach is expected.\u00a0\nThese subtle differences can create misunderstandings, hesitation in responding, and even disengagement among your culturally diverse workforce. \n\ud83c\udf0e\ud83d\udcac\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u26a0\ufe0f \nThe Problem:\nCultural differences in email communication are often overlooked, yet they can lead to serious workplace challenges, including:\u00a0\n\ud83d\udea8\n \nMisunderstandings and tension\n\u2014A straightforward request in one culture might feel abrupt or disrespectful in another.\n\ud83d\udcc9\n \nDecreased collaboration and engagement\n\u2014Employees are hesitant to respond due to fear of misinterpretation.\n\u23f3\n \nDelays and inefficiencies\n\u2014Multiple back-and-forth emails just to clarify a simple message.\n\ud83d\udcbc\n \nLost business opportunities\n\u2014International partners may disengage if they perceive your communication as culturally insensitive.\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\ud83d\udca1\n The Future You\u2019re Waiting For:\nImagine a workplace where every email strengthens relationships rather than creating unintentional barriers. Where employees feel heard, valued, and confident in their communications\u2014no matter their cultural background.\u00a0\nA future where:\n\u2705\n Messages are clear, culturally considerate, and well-received.\n\u2705\n Global teams collaborate seamlessly, without misunderstandings.\n\u2705\n Leaders foster an inclusive, high-trust environment through intentional communication.\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\ud83c\udfa4\n \u00a0What\u2019s Next:\nIn my next email, I\u2019ll share specific strategies you can implement \nright away\n to ensure your emails resonate across cultures\u2014leading to better collaboration, higher engagement, and a more inclusive workplace. Stay tuned! \n\ud83d\udce9\n\u00a0\nLet\u2019s build workplaces where \nevery email is a bridge\u2014not a barrier.\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\nBye for now,\u00a0\nLuiza\n___________________________________\n\u00a0\nLuiza Dreasher, President and CEO (she/her/hers)\nMastering Cultural Differences\u00a0\nI work with leaders who want to create a work environment where all employees feel valued and want to stay.\nAt \nMastering Cultural Differences LLC,\n we are committed to helping organizations build inclusive, culturally competent workplaces where every individual feels valued and respected.

Between 2014 and 2023, the number of remote workers tripled, growing from 6.5 million to over 22.4 million. Remote work peaked in 2021, with 17.9% of employees working remotely, but has since declined to 13.8% in 2023 as many industries returned to in-person work.\u00a0\nCities like Austin, Raleigh, and Denver have become hubs for remote workers due to their tech-friendly economies and high quality of life. Austin leads the pack, with 25% of its workforce utilizing remote or hybrid models. Meanwhile, cities such as Omaha, Akron, and Harrisburg saw the most significant increases in remote work adoption, with growth rates exceeding 300% over the past decade. Interestingly, some medium-sized metro areas, such as Lancaster, PA and Cape Coral, FL, have seen continued growth in remote work post-pandemic, underscoring the enduring appeal of flexible work options.\nDr. Gleb\u2019s Take\nRemote work is no longer a trend\u2014it\u2019s a permanent feature of the modern workforce. The massive growth over the past decade underscores the demand for flexibility and work-life balance. Companies that resist remote work or hybrid models are operating on outdated assumptions and risk alienating top talent. The data also highlights an important geographic shift: remote workers are choosing locations based on lifestyle, not proximity to traditional job centers. This is an opportunity for smaller metro areas and regions historically outside the spotlight to attract skilled professionals by fostering remote-friendly ecosystems. Leaders must recognize that the future of work prioritizes autonomy, technology-driven collaboration, and location independence. Clinging to pre-pandemic office norms will put organizations at a strategic disadvantage in a rapidly evolving labor market.\n\u201c\nIf firms want people to \u2018return to office,\u2019 they should offer a better experience\n\u201d \n(Workplace Insight)\nSummary\nA report from the British Council for Offices (BCO) emphasizes that to entice employees back to physical workspaces, companies must rethink office environments to compete with the comfort and flexibility of home. The report, titled \nTowards Experience Utopia\n, positions employees as the ultimate judges of value, urging organizations to treat them as customers by creating engaging, meaningful, and flexible office experiences.\nThe report outlines strategies such as data-driven decision-making, promoting employee well-being, and fostering a culture of innovation. It highlights the importance of aligning office design with employee expectations and incorporating insights into space utilization and feedback. Practical recommendations include flexible leasing models, sustainable building practices, and focusing on inclusivity and operational excellence. Case studies from companies like NatWest, Deloitte, and the Government Property Agency illustrate how thoughtful investments in office experiences can create environments that inspire employees to return.\nDr. Gleb\u2019s Take\nThe return-to-office debate, research shows, should not be about forcing employees back; it\u2019s about making them \nwant\n to come back. This report gets it right: the modern office needs to offer something home offices cannot. Companies stuck in the mindset that mandates and metrics will drive in-office attendance are setting themselves up for failure.\nTreat employees like valued customers. Redesign workspaces with their needs and preferences in mind, blending flexibility, comfort, and purpose. Use data to inform decisions, but don\u2019t ignore the human element\u2014employees crave connection, creativity, and meaning in their workspaces. The workplace of the future is hybrid, dynamic, and employee-centered. Businesses unwilling to embrace this shift will lose not just their top talent but their competitive edge.\n\"\nPrison And Crime: Much More Than You Wanted to Know\n\" \n(Astral Codex Ten)\nSummary\nThis comprehensive article explores the effectiveness of long prison sentences in reducing crime. It examines three primary mechanisms: deterrence (preventing crimes by threat of punishment), incapacitation (preventing crimes by locking offenders away), and aftereffects (impact on recidivism post-incarceration). Research suggests:\nDeterrence effects of long sentences are minimal, with only a small impact on crime rates.\nIncapacitation is effective, with each year of incarceration preventing an average of one violent crime and six property crimes.\nAftereffects are mixed\u2014medium-length sentences may ruin lives, fostering recidivism, while for very long sentences, the criminals age out of the most likely time for people to commit crimes, when they are young.\nCost-benefit analysis reveals that longer prison sentences are often less cost-effective than alternative methods such as investing in policing or probation. Policymakers are urged to consider these alternatives for reducing crime.\nDr. Gleb\u2019s Take\nThe evidence is clear: long prison sentences are a costly and inefficient tool for crime reduction. The obsession with being \u201ctough on crime\u201d leads to emotional, politically driven policies that ignore the data. Incapacitation works, but we\u2019re paying a premium for a strategy that disproportionately harms communities and doesn\u2019t address root causes. And to the extent we put people in prison, we should either do short prison sentences, under 6 months, or long ones, over 5 years, with medium-term prison sentences of 6 months to 5 years being the worst of all possible worlds.\nThe real solution lies in smarter investments\u2014hiring more police to increase the certainty of punishment, improving probation systems, and expanding courts to ensure efficient legal processing. Locking people away is a blunt instrument when precision tools like targeted policing and community interventions are available. If we continue pouring resources into prisons without a strategy shift, we\u2019re wasting taxpayer money and perpetuating cycles of crime.\nWhat did you think of my take on these articles?

This silent struggle leads to disengagement, miscommunication, and poor decision-making.\u00a0\nBut here\u2019s the good news: \nYou can fix this with a few simple yet powerful strategies!\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\ud83d\udd52\n Strategy #1: Rotate Meeting Times Fairly\u00a0\n\ud83d\udca1\n \nRespect work-life balance across all regions\n\u00a0\nInstead of expecting the same people to attend inconvenient meetings every time, \nrotate meeting times\n to share the burden equally. If someone has to join at 10 PM one week, make sure it\u2019s someone else\u2019s turn the next.\u00a0\n\u2705\n \nBonus Tip:\n Use asynchronous communication (emails, recordings, and message boards) to gather input from those who can\u2019t attend live.\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\ud83d\udde3\ufe0f\n Strategy #2: Adapt to Different Communication Styles\u00a0\n\ud83d\udca1\n \nSilence \u2260 Agreement!\n\u00a0\nIn some cultures, direct disagreement is seen as disrespectful, while in others, debate is encouraged. To create a safe space for all voices:\u00a0\n\u2714\ufe0f\n Allow anonymous feedback for sensitive discussions.\n\u2714\ufe0f\n Ask direct but open-ended questions like \n\"How does this align with your experience?\"\n instead of \n\"Does everyone agree?\"\n\u2714\ufe0f\n Follow up 1:1 with quieter team members to ensure they feel heard.\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\ud83d\udcc5\n Strategy #3: Clarify Expectations for Time & Deadlines\u00a0\n\ud83d\udca1\n \n\"ASAP\" means different things across cultures!\n\u00a0\nSome cultures prioritize speed, while others value thorough deliberation. To avoid frustration:\u00a0\n\u2714\ufe0f\n Be explicit about deadlines (\ne.g., \u201cReports due by Friday at 5 PM EST, United States\u201d\n).\n\u2714\ufe0f\n Set clear decision-making processes so that no one feels pressured or left out.\n\u2714\ufe0f\n Use collaborative tools like shared documents where people can contribute in their own time zones.\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\ud83e\udd1d\n Strategy #4: Build Trust Across Cultures\u00a0\n\ud83d\udca1\n \nTrust isn\u2019t universal\u2014it\u2019s built differently everywhere!\n\u00a0\nFor some, trust is based on \ncredibility\n (titles, experience), for others, it\u2019s about \nreliability\n (doing what you say) or having the opportunity to get to know each other. A successful virtual team:\u00a0\n\u2714\ufe0f\n Establishes \nteam norms\n that respect both perspectives.\n\u2714\ufe0f\n Encourages small talk and informal chats to strengthen relationships.\n\u2714\ufe0f\n Uses video calls selectively\u2014some team members may prefer writing over speaking.\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\ud83d\ude80\n Ready to Make Your Virtual Meetings More Inclusive?\u00a0\nBy making small but intentional changes, you can \nboost engagement, collaboration, and retention\n across your global workforce.\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\ud83d\udcc6\n Let\u2019s chat!\n I\u2019d love to help your team create virtual meetings that work for \neveryone\n.

I was struck by\u00a0how closely politics and religion intermingle. U.S. Vice President JD Vance spoke at the International Religious Freedom (IRF) Summit. President Donald Trump addressed the National Prayer Breakfast.\nBut the relationship between politics and religion is often uneasy. This uneasiness was on display a week after New York Catholic archbishop Cardinal Timothy Dolan gave a warmly received invocation at Donald Trump\u2019s inauguration. Fellow Catholic, U.S. Vice President JD Vance, leveled criticism against the US Conference of Catholic Bishops, which 'hurt' the cardinal.\u00a0\nYou can read my reflection on this uneasy relationship in my latest Patheos blog,\u00a0\nThe Moth and the Flame: When Politics and Religion Collide\n. The title is a nod the late sociologist of religion N.J. Demerath III.\nRead: The Moth and The Flame\n \nYou can also see my conversation about faith-friendly workplaces with Cardinal Dolan from 2020 below. Ironically, it was right after he interviewed former U.S. Attorney General Bill Barr. \n \nAs highlighted in last week's newsletter,\u00a0the state of religious freedom worldwide is at its lowest point in 16 years and that current strategies for combatting the deterioration of this universal human right are insufficient.\nThe solution is to adopt a new strategy that harnesses a powerful and untapped force with a vested interest in building religious freedom worldwide. \nThat\u2019s business\n.\nIf you want to see this in action, join us for our 6th annual Faith@Work multi-faith conference in Washington DC:\u00a0\n \nMay 20-22, 2025, Dare to Overcome\nDare to Overcome\n (DTO) is the premier annual gathering for Fortune 500 company employee resource groups (ERGs), corporate chaplains, and other faith-and-belief workplace initiatives to share best practices and celebrate achievements.\nOn Days 1 & 2, join us for essential conversations and dynamic presentations on issues companies, leaders and employees are facing in an ever-changing socio-economic environment at home and abroad.\nIf your company hasn't yet requested a\u00a0link to the \nREDI Index Faith-Friendly Workplace survey\n, do so today! \nDeadline March 15th\n, with\u00a0Awards presented at a gala dinner on Tuesday, May 20th,\u00a0the conference's first night.\n \nDay 3 (optional) is the IRF Builders Summit focused on ways people build religious freedom for all internationally through faith-friendly workplaces, education, positive engagement, and cross-cultural religious literacy, among others.\n>>\n \nSPONSORSHIP PACKET for Days 1&2\n \nREGISTER NOW\n \nDay 1\n will begin with special networking sessions for faith-specific and interfaith employee resource groups (ERGs), an opening Plenary and the Keynote by the Dean of the Busch School of Business,\u00a0Andrew Abela (all attendees get his new book \nSuperhabits: the Universal System for a Successful Life\n).\nLooking forward to seeing you in Washington DC in May!\nBrian Grim\nRFBF President\nDare to Overcome, Global Chair \nValuable Gift at Conference to first 200 attendees\n \n \nRegistration and Sponsorships OPEN!\n \nRFBF helps people in business practice the virtues that faith reinforces through our annual \n\"Dare to Overcome\" Fortune 500 Faith@Work conference\n\u00a0in Washington DC (May 20-22, 2025).

    "body": "Plus: a handout or a helping hand? \nFebruary 12, 2025 \u00a0\u00b7\u00a0 \nView in browser\n \nThe Insightful Leader\nBY \nKELLOGG INSIGHT\nLeadership advice from the Kellogg School of Management at Northwestern University\nGood morning,\nWe\u2019re told to be bold and ask for what we want in interviews\u2014but is there a line?\nKellogg\u2019s \nLeigh Thompson\n, an expert negotiator, addresses the question in the context of a student who had a dilemma: Should they leverage one job offer against another they had already accepted?\nWe\u2019ll get into that today. Plus, how emotions affect our willingness to accept help.\nThe scenario\nIn her Substack, \u201cDear Professor: Negotiation Help,\u201d Thompson, a Kellogg professor of management and organizations, explains that her student had signed an offer with Company A, but soon after sought and received an offer from Company B, in a geographical location they strongly preferred. Their dilemma was whether and how to use the second offer (from Company B) as leverage to request a reassignment to a different office within Company A. Their initial plan was to send an email to Company A essentially stating that they had another job offer, and unless Company A could assign them to a different geographical location, they would retract their acceptance.\nThompson\u2019s recommendations? Pump the brakes.\nAcknowledge your commitment\nOnce you\u2019ve signed an offer, it\u2019s important to approach subsequent negotiations delicately, Thompson says. Using a new offer as \u201cleverage\u201d can often be perceived as a threat\u2014a tactic unlikely to foster goodwill. In fact, it could harm your reputation. The professional business world is highly connected, and people talk!\nRequest a synchronous conversation\nThompson says that you should only deliver good news and updates via email and that negotiation conversations of this nature require something that\u2019s more verbal or face-to-face. You should request a phone or video call with a decision-maker at Company A, she recommends, which allows for rapport-building in real time and conversational adjustments\u2014and creates space for collaborative problem-solving. During this conversation, avoid mentioning the new offer, and instead present the discussion as an opportunity to explore a mutual solution, such as a reassignment to your preferred location.\nFrame your request from the employer\u2019s perspective\nWhen presenting your case, focus on how the change would benefit the organization. For instance, explain how your presence in the desired location could strengthen client relationships, align with strategic goals, or address specific needs. Avoid framing the request solely around your personal preferences; instead, emphasize how this move aligns with the company\u2019s objectives. Use research or evidence to support your proposal and demonstrate that you\u2019ve thought carefully about their perspective.\nRead more in Thompson\u2019s Substack, \nDear Professor\n.\n \nA handout or a helping hand?\nHow people perceive the help they receive can make a significant difference when it comes to humanitarian and charitable aid.\nKellogg researchers \nSamantha Kassirer\n, \nAta Jami\n, and \nMaryam Kouchaki\n conducted a battery of experiments in Kenya and the U.S. to find out how different types of charitable aid influenced people\u2019s emotions\u2014and whether those emotions would affect their willingness to accept aid in the first place.\n\u201cPast studies have compared the effect of offering cash versus no aid at all,\u201d Kouchaki says, \u201cwhereas we wanted to compare people\u2019s response to cash versus food aid.\u201d\nTheir results suggest that cash and in-kind aid encourage different psychological responses and behaviors from the people who receive it.\nIn-kind donations can lead to positive feelings of being cared for and better take-up of aid. But under certain conditions, cash can create feelings of shame\u2014and make people less likely to accept the charity\u2019s help. However, when cash aid comes from the government instead of a charitable organization, these emotional and behavioral effects disappear.\nThe takeaway, according to Kassirer, isn\u2019t that cash is bad and food is good. Instead, the kind of aid charities provide also sends a social message that can either support or undermine their efforts.\nRead more in \nKellogg Insight\n.\n\u201cNormal is more than a setting on the washing machine. Being reminded of the prevalence of a problem is a potent psychological force that changes how people judge everything from the severity of wounds to the dangers of drunk driving to chest pain and even personal medical risks.\u201d\n\u2014 \nLauren Eskreis-Winkler\n and coauthors, in a \nnew research paper\n about the big problem paradox. The research was also featured in \nThe New York Times\n.\nSee you next week,\nLaura Pavin, multimedia editor\nKellogg Insight\nFollow us on \nLinkedIn\n.\nAnd listen to our \npodcasts\n.\nKellogg School of Management\n | \n2211 Campus Drive\n, \nEvanston, IL 60208\n \nUnsubscribe larry@lcwmail.com\n \nUpdate Profile\n | \nConstant Contact Data Notice\n \nSent by \ninsight@kellogg.northwestern.edu",

However, the new administration aims to tear down these barriers, empowering businesses to deploy generative AI technologies faster and with fewer compliance burdens. \nTo learn more, check out \nthis\n \nblog\n.\nRead Blog\n \nPrefer video to text?

Our association hired him to present a one-hour implicit bias training for our members, and he was able to customize the material so it was relevant to all of our attendees. He was very easy to work with and very responsive to all of our emails.\n He was also very engaging during the webinar, and he used polls and personal stories to make sure our attendees were paying attention and engaging in the material.\n I would highly recommend him for any future speaking opportunities!\u201d\nMattea Tavernor\n, Conventions & Continuing Education Manager, Illinois State Dental Societ\nSchedule a Free Consultation\n \nWhat's Up With Me\nFear and anxiety about the future, with a dollop of hope and optimism. That was the outcome of my conversation with my business partner and wife Agnes Vishnevkin when we discussed the consequences of the surprisingly rapid development of Gen AI, following the recent news about China's DeepSeek and President Trump's \"damn the torpedoes \u2013 full speed ahead\" approach to Gen AI. \nNow, I'm no AI skeptic, I think it's an incredibly powerful tool with world-transforming potential, even more so than nuclear fission. But like nuclear fission, I think we should have some guardrails on it, preferably in advance so we can avoid disasters, rather than waiting until a meltdown. So while I'm hopeful about the positive impact of Gen AI - heck, I'm writing a book about it - I worry about the consequences of a lack of concern about safety.

This is his \narticle\n on the topic and I attached what DLA has been sending out to some of their clients during this time.\n\u00a0\nMy notes are below from our conversation;\n-Most companies who have federal money are bending over backwards to not be the first 9 companies.\n-Lie vs lead.\n-Suggestions being given to corporations to provide same programs to everyone vs certain groups.\n-Keep ERG's and BRGs in existence but don't give different amounts of money to different groups.\n-Do not use DEI verbiage at all, instead use words like leadership principles, managerial principles, and community engagement\n-Hi hypothesis is we are going back to the 90s with what we see in corporations, like a book club.\n-Language needs to be squeaky clean.\n-All DEI employees will have to now report and be retitled under leadership principles and talent and development.\n-Ways to justify focus on hiring certain groups that can be legal; Hire based on Increasing consumer pool. \n-10Ks need to repositioned. Disney just came out with theirs.\n-When first 9 companies get named, then more companies will change overnight.\n-Memos from Pam Bondi will govern what happens.\n-Thousands of employees in Washington got laid off, this is much more serious then a lot of folks think.\n-Canceling of contracts will happen and legal cannot\u00a0do\u00a0anything about it.\n-By May we will see a lot of change.\n-Couple months of companies figuring it out.\n-Fortune 500 companies want to be conservative now.\n-Offer programs across the board (don't offer to\u00a0just\u00a0one\u00a0group)\n\u00a0\nRecording and Deck 1: Thank you for joining the FortneyScott webinar addressing the new Trump Executive Orders.\u00a0 For your reference, we are providing links to \nthe PowerPoint\n and a\u00a0\nrecording of the webinar\n.\u00a0 We will be in touch with future webinars and updates.\nRecording and Deck 2: Thank you for attending our recent webinar - we hope you found it useful and engaging. If you were unable to attend, we hope to see you at a future program!\nFor your reference, we have provided the links below to the recording of the presentation, the PowerPoint slides, and a CLE verification and evaluation form.\nPresentation Recording\nPowerPoint Presentation\nWebinar Attendance Form\n\u00a0\nRyan is open to being available to you and your clients, so please let me know if you have any questions.\n\u00a0\nAlisa\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\nAlisa Kolodizner \n(She/Her)\nCSMO and Managing Partner\nLCW\nEmail: \na.kolodizner@lcwmail.com\nOffice: +1.773.888.9355 [CDT]\nMobile: +1.773.430.3534\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\nWebsite\n\u00a0\n|\n\u00a0\nTwitter\n \n|\n\u00a0\nFacebook\n\u00a0\n|\n\u00a0\nLinkedIn\nView our upcoming events\n\u00a0| \nSign-up for our newsletter",
