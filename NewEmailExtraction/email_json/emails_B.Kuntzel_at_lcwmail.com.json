They are moving some operations to India and have been experiencing a number of intercultural challenges. We are pricing translating the deck into German for them and providing in-person and virtual options. I think their preference is in-person in Germany but they may go with the less expensive option.\n\u00a0\nWe don\u2019t yet have a specific date but they would like it as soon as possible. However, it will take 3-4 weeks to complete the translation of the deck.

Thanks \n\u00a0\nNov2 will be dedicated to action planning & will be the last session for cohort 7. \n\u00a0\nAs a reminder, here is the list of challenges discussed during the codev session on October 19: \n\u00a0\nCHALLENGES in the ROOM: \nTable 1: how can I accelerate the process of inclusivity in my large team \nConnect with experts for the assessment - doing the investigation \nTable 2: as a Leader I have a challenge with gender diversity in IT \nBe more active & headhunt + for senior positions instead of just waiting for the pipeline to produce\nTable 3: I want to create a diverse team. How do I address language & cultural barriers \nBe more formal into communicating to your team that there is a person in the team who can help with language barriers & facilitation \nTable 4: Self awareness. How can I improve myself and be aware of my hidden bias.\u00a0 \nTalk to diverse people in the team or connect with RH to know how they are feeling in the team \n\u00a0\nWhat did you learn today that you are willing to build going forward: \nDiversity has a cost but it's a cost we should be willing to go forward\nUse resources available (Alexandre from NEO) and ask help to your peers \nMake it know to my team that this is a topic that team members can come to me to share \nAs a leader, we are not perfect // we feel the pressure of needing to be perfect, especially from our team members. And we need our team members to see our vulnerability and to understand we would make mistakes\nDenis spoke about Self ID and we need to promote it \n\u00a0\u00a0\nRaashi\u2019s parting words : \nShare with your teams about this week & share your D&I commitment from today \nYou have a team that you can reach out (D&I + HR + ERGs) + your peers \nWe need your leadership, your accountability & vulnerability \n\u00a0\nAll the best & Bastian, will write to you separately for Cohort 8 \u2013 notably regarding travel \n\u00a0\nRapha\u00eblle \n\u00a0\n\u00a0\nDe\u00a0:\n Bastian K\u00fcntzel <bastian@incontro-training.org> \nEnvoy\u00e9\u00a0:\n mercredi 4 octobre 2023 19:39\n\u00c0\u00a0:\n Theoria Cason <theoria.cason@ubisoft.com>; Bastian Kuntzel <B.Kuntzel@lcwmail.com>; Rapha\u00eblle Lalo <raphaelle.lalo@ubisoft.com>\nCc\u00a0:\n Tamara Thorpe <t.thorpe@lcwmail.com>; Conner Williams <c.williams@lcwmail.com>\nObjet\u00a0:\n RE: Advancing Inclusion for Leaders FACILITATORS\n\u00a0\nThank you for this context, dear Raphaelle.
