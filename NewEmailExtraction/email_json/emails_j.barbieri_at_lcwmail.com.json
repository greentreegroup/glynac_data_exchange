    "body": "Hi,\nReconciliation runs are part of a payroll provider's normal quarter's-end reconciliation process. Zenefits Payroll is running those corrections to ensure you pay the correct amount to each tax jurisdiction where you're liable for payroll taxes.\nWhen we do reconciliations, we look for variances between what we collected in taxes from your pay runs in the quarter and what the tax agencies expect you to pay. In some cases, we'll find variances between these two amounts. Variances are normal, and can be the result of a number of things.\nHere's a snapshot of where you stand, and what will happen next:\nFor your Full-Service jurisdictions, we will automatically create pay runs in your account and you'll see the following net amount \ncredited to \nyour bank account ending in ******6303 by April 07, 2023 for $0.04 for Unemployment Tax.\nFor additional details, please feel free to review your \nAll In One report\n from your Payroll app.\nThanks, \nZenefits \nQuestions or concerns?

No matter if an employee has had too much - or not enough - deducted on their paystub, you can decide how to correct the discrepancy on your Deductions Dashboard.\nWhenever Zenefits sees a discrepancy between what should have been deducted and what was actually deducted, we'll highlight it and recommend an \nadjustment plan\n. You can approve the plan to enact the adjustments, or decline the plan and your deductions will remain as they are.\nYou can review proposed adjustments by clicking on the \"Pending Adjustments\" button on your Deductions Dashboard. \nStart exploring your employees' deductions now\n.\nThanks,\nZenefits\nFor more information or assistance, please visit \nhelp.zenefits.com\n.",

    "body": "Hi,\nReconciliation runs are part of a payroll provider's normal quarter's-end reconciliation process. Zenefits Payroll is running those corrections to ensure you pay the correct amount to each tax jurisdiction where you're liable for payroll taxes.\nWhen we do reconciliations, we look for variances between what we collected in taxes from your pay runs in the quarter and what the tax agencies expect you to pay. In some cases, we'll find variances between these two amounts. Variances are normal, and can be the result of a number of things.\nHere's a snapshot of where you stand, and what will happen next:\nFor your Full-Service jurisdictions, we will automatically create pay runs in your account and you'll see the following net amount \ndebited from \nyour bank account ending in ******6303 by October 09, 2023 for $0.03 for Unemployment Tax.\nFor additional details, please feel free to review your \nAll In One report\n from your Payroll app.\nThanks, \nTriNet Zenefits \nQuestions or concerns?

That said, I\u2019m not a fan of changing the rules in the middle of the game. In this instance we pay out this past quarter\u2019s commissions as the expectation was set with the folks involved. Then we can adjust for the subsequent periods.\n\u00a0\nWe certainly need to be cognizant of what actions we are incentivizing and rewarding. For background, I believe as we ramped up formalizing the department, Alisa\u2019s goal was to first incentivize outreach activity and to reward the BizDev department for the actions that they can control. They do not control if the consultant actually closes the deal they marshalled forward.\n\u00a0\nI am very much open to developing a new commission structure that takes those variables into account.\n\u00a0\nChuck\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\nChuck Adams \n(He/Him)\nCo-CEO and Managing Principal\nLCW\nWebsite\n\u00a0\n|\n\u00a0\nTwitter\n \n|\n\u00a0\nFacebook\n\u00a0\n|\n\u00a0\nLinkedIn\nView our upcoming events\n | \nSign-up for our newsletter\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\nFrom:\n Alan Samsky <asamsky@sutkermoran.com> \nSent:\n Wednesday, July 26, 2023 11:58 AM\nTo:\n Alisa Kolodizner <a.kolodizner@lcwmail.com>; Jennifer Barbieri <j.barbieri@lcwmail.com>; Antonio Jones <a.jones@lcwmail.com>; Chuck Adams <c.adams@lcwmail.com>\nSubject:\n RE: Bonus Payout - BD Team\n\u00a0\nI recommend that the policy be changed based on my outline below.\n\u00a0\nHappy to discuss it next week.\n\u00a0\nRegards,\n\u00a0\nAlan\n\u00a0\nAlan R.

In Hubspot when you click on a deal, there \nshould\n be a Quote saved in the portal. The Quote is the proposal and you can open the file to see when the date was sent. Please work with Pedro and Rebecca to get this field in Hubspot and populated so you do not have to dig through the data every quarter. There are a lot of missing Quotes in Hubspot. Please also work with Pedro and Rebecca to have a full system of accounting for the proposals sent.\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n2. I understand and appreciate your prospective here. The reasoning behind this bonus was to get the BD team to act quickly in getting proposals answered and out the door. This historically was an issue where proposals would take longer than necessary to respond to.\n\u00a0\n3. The proposal bonus is only paid in the quarter the proposal is sent out and not the stage it sits in Hubspot. So as long as the proposal was sent in Q2, the bonus should be paid and whether it stays \u00a0or moves up the pipeline, is irrelevant. \n\u00a0\n4 and 5 \u2013 \n@Alisa Kolodizner\n and \n@Chuck Adams\n Please weigh in.\n\u00a0\nThank you,\nJennifer\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\nFrom:\n Antonio Jones <\na.jones@lcwmail.com\n> \nSent:\n Tuesday, July 25, 2023 5:06 PM\nTo:\n Jennifer Barbieri <\nj.barbieri@lcwmail.com\n>\nCc:\n Alan Samsky <\nasamsky@sutkermoran.com\n>; Chuck Adams <\nc.adams@lcwmail.com\n>; Alisa Kolodizner <\na.kolodizner@lcwmail.com\n>\nSubject:\n RE: Bonus Payout - BD Team\n\u00a0\nHi Jennifer \u2013 thanks for including me. The calculation makes sense. I have some questions around the process. \u00a0My file is attached. The lines without a controller note I still need to review.\nVerification of proposals sent and signed SOW\u2019s \u2013 as proof of proposals sent, I would expect to see a proposal file sent out on the day listed in the spreadsheet in HubSpot ONLY. Outlook has a function that allows you . For example, Berd LLC lists a proposal sent on 4/7/2023 but I can\u2019t find evidence in HubSpot. this is critical for accounting. Reviewing each bonus line to be paid and proof that we should pay it out.\nIt would be prudent to only pay out bonuses to BD if a proposal is sent and a SOW is signed. Paying out bonuses for proposals sent and jobs not won sends the wrong signal to associates. It incentivizes channel stuffing for bonuses. Sending out proposals that aren\u2019t likely to be won.\nWe should not pay bonuses for these stages: negotiation, passed to consultant, proposal in progress, and closed lost. These all represent steps in the sales process and do not indicate that we will receive any money to pay for said bonus paid out. It\u2019ll also cause multiple payments for the same proposal if the proposal extends over more than one quarter. Accounting would also have to compare previous bonus payments to the current period to see if we\u2019re double paying.\nIf we\u2019re in agreement to pay for proposal sent and jobs did not award it would help if we lowered the commission for those, since we aren\u2019t getting any money and the associate is already on salary. They don\u2019t carry the same weight as jobs won.\nClear definition of proposal needed. Does this include a quote, catalog, and or recommendation PowerPoint?\nAntonio Jones\nHe/Him\nController\nLCW\nWebsite\n\u00a0\n|\n\u00a0\nTwitter\n \n|\n\u00a0\nFacebook\n\u00a0\n|\n\u00a0\nLinkedIn\nView our upcoming events\n | \nSign-up for our newsletter\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\nFrom:\n Jennifer Barbieri <\nj.barbieri@lcwmail.com\n> \nSent:\n Monday, July 24, 2023 3:36 PM\nTo:\n Antonio Jones <\na.jones@lcwmail.com\n>\nSubject:\n FW: Bonus Payout -BD Team\n\u00a0\nHi Toni \u2013 can you help me with these commission/proposal bonus payments?

There are a few questions I have here for the team \u2013\n\u00a0\nThe Ad Council proposal date was in 2022, the SOW issue date was in March, and the signed SOW date was 6/8. Should this be eligible for the commission since the proposal and SOW issue date was pre-BD Bonus Structure which started in Q2? It doesn\u2019t qualify for the proposal bonus.\u00a0 \n\u00a0\nIf this commission structure remains, this will need to be clarified and put in writing for Pedro. We were told SOW signature (not for counting towards a proposal creation, but for the percentage of the sale). An SOW is just a proposal until signed, and Hannah is responsible for this sale. We sent the attached, and then it was transitioned to Tamara, who received the signed SOW in June. \nUlteig is closed won. I don\u2019t see this quote in Compas. \n@Melissa Neu\n, can you confirm? \nThere was confusion with the consultant about whether the attached signed proposal is the same as a SOW. I\u2019ve confirmed with Andrea and discussed with Chuck that she will still need to create an SOW; it doesn\u2019t look like she has done so yet. However, per the attached, the client has committed and signed. \nShould Hannah be paid for the proposals sent after her departure date? (UL LLC, Bright Horizons, nVent, Hopechicago) If not, then the number of proposals for her is 33 (also excluding The Ad Council), which is one short of qualifying for the bonus of 34 total proposals sent for the QTR to qualify. \nHannah worked on Bright Horizons and HopeChicago.\u00a0 Hannah helped build the HopeChicago proposal, but I presented it to the client after she left. Also, the date isn\u2019t accurate for UL, LLC.in HubSpot. The deal was created well after the original proposal was sent on 5/9. I\u2019ll get HubSpot fixed, and I\u2019m attaching the proposal for your records.\n\u00a0\nThank you,\nJennifer\n\u00a0\nFrom:\n Melissa Neu <\nm.neu@lcwmail.com\n> \nSent:\n Thursday, July 6, 2023 7:25 PM\nTo:\n Alisa Kolodizner <\na.kolodizner@lcwmail.com\n>; Jennifer Barbieri <\nj.barbieri@lcwmail.com\n>; Chuck Adams <\nc.adams@lcwmail.com\n>\nCc:\n Maria Mercado <\nm.mercado@lcwmail.com\n>; Briza Cardenas <\nb.cardenas@lcwmail.com\n>\nSubject:\n RE: Bonus Payout -BD Team\n\u00a0\nHi Everyone,\n\u00a0\nPlease see the attached report with updates.

Your efforts helped me to review the accuracy of the data as it is being pulled from HubSpot. The report feature I used was not entirely accurate, so I\u2019ve updated the attached report for you today and worked on troubleshooting the issue. The attached has removed any proposals in progress and Deb\u2019s pursuits that we were not involved in. Moog is The only existing client I have record of building a proposal for this quarter.\n\u00a0\nTracking proposals sent by the date is tricky for a few reasons, including that there is no HubSpot reporting feature to pull a deal status change date. Since we don\u2019t only create proposals only in HubSpot and often make proposals that other individual emails to the prospect, this information is typically tracked via email correspondence and notes, I will need to work with Pedro to create a new process that makes the data that you can pull more accurate. \n\u00a0\nOne immediate change is that I\u2019ve created multiple workflows to log the date a deal status is changed to Proposal Sent, Negotiation, and Passed to Consultant. This change will allow folks to quickly look at the left sidebar to see the dates and allow the team to pull a report with the data going forward. Keep in mind it can\u2019t work retroactively; however, it will help Pedro to report progress to you in Q3.\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\nI will work with Pedro to ensure that any changes to the attached are captured in HubSpot by EOB Friday, and I will provide you with a final report at that time.\n\u00a0\nPlease let me know if you have any questions or need additional information.\n\u00a0\nKind regards,\n\u00a0\nMelissa\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\nC.

In Hubspot when you click on a deal, there \nshould\n be a Quote saved in the portal. The Quote is the proposal and you can open the file to see when the date was sent. Please work with Pedro and Rebecca to get this field in Hubspot and populated so you do not have to dig through the data every quarter. There are a lot of missing Quotes in Hubspot. Please also work with Pedro and Rebecca to have a full system of accounting for the proposals sent.\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n2. I understand and appreciate your prospective here. The reasoning behind this bonus was to get the BD team to act quickly in getting proposals answered and out the door. This historically was an issue where proposals would take longer than necessary to respond to.\n\u00a0\n3. The proposal bonus is only paid in the quarter the proposal is sent out and not the stage it sits in Hubspot. So as long as the proposal was sent in Q2, the bonus should be paid and whether it stays \u00a0or moves up the pipeline, is irrelevant. \n\u00a0\n4 and 5 \u2013 \n@Alisa Kolodizner\n and \n@Chuck Adams\n Please weigh in.\n\u00a0\nThank you,\nJennifer\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\nFrom:\n Antonio Jones <\na.jones@lcwmail.com\n> \nSent:\n Tuesday, July 25, 2023 5:06 PM\nTo:\n Jennifer Barbieri <\nj.barbieri@lcwmail.com\n>\nCc:\n Alan Samsky <\nasamsky@sutkermoran.com\n>; Chuck Adams <\nc.adams@lcwmail.com\n>; Alisa Kolodizner <\na.kolodizner@lcwmail.com\n>\nSubject:\n RE: Bonus Payout - BD Team\n\u00a0\nHi Jennifer \u2013 thanks for including me. The calculation makes sense. I have some questions around the process. \u00a0My file is attached. The lines without a controller note I still need to review.\nVerification of proposals sent and signed SOW\u2019s \u2013 as proof of proposals sent, I would expect to see a proposal file sent out on the day listed in the spreadsheet in HubSpot ONLY. Outlook has a function that allows you . For example, Berd LLC lists a proposal sent on 4/7/2023 but I can\u2019t find evidence in HubSpot. this is critical for accounting. Reviewing each bonus line to be paid and proof that we should pay it out.\nIt would be prudent to only pay out bonuses to BD if a proposal is sent and a SOW is signed. Paying out bonuses for proposals sent and jobs not won sends the wrong signal to associates. It incentivizes channel stuffing for bonuses. Sending out proposals that aren\u2019t likely to be won.\nWe should not pay bonuses for these stages: negotiation, passed to consultant, proposal in progress, and closed lost. These all represent steps in the sales process and do not indicate that we will receive any money to pay for said bonus paid out. It\u2019ll also cause multiple payments for the same proposal if the proposal extends over more than one quarter. Accounting would also have to compare previous bonus payments to the current period to see if we\u2019re double paying.\nIf we\u2019re in agreement to pay for proposal sent and jobs did not award it would help if we lowered the commission for those, since we aren\u2019t getting any money and the associate is already on salary. They don\u2019t carry the same weight as jobs won.\nClear definition of proposal needed. Does this include a quote, catalog, and or recommendation PowerPoint?\nAntonio Jones\nHe/Him\nController\nLCW\nWebsite\n\u00a0\n|\n\u00a0\nTwitter\n \n|\n\u00a0\nFacebook\n\u00a0\n|\n\u00a0\nLinkedIn\nView our upcoming events\n | \nSign-up for our newsletter\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\nFrom:\n Jennifer Barbieri <\nj.barbieri@lcwmail.com\n> \nSent:\n Monday, July 24, 2023 3:36 PM\nTo:\n Antonio Jones <\na.jones@lcwmail.com\n>\nSubject:\n FW: Bonus Payout -BD Team\n\u00a0\nHi Toni \u2013 can you help me with these commission/proposal bonus payments?

There are a few questions I have here for the team \u2013\n\u00a0\nThe Ad Council proposal date was in 2022, the SOW issue date was in March, and the signed SOW date was 6/8. Should this be eligible for the commission since the proposal and SOW issue date was pre-BD Bonus Structure which started in Q2? It doesn\u2019t qualify for the proposal bonus.\u00a0 \n\u00a0\nIf this commission structure remains, this will need to be clarified and put in writing for Pedro. We were told SOW signature (not for counting towards a proposal creation, but for the percentage of the sale). An SOW is just a proposal until signed, and Hannah is responsible for this sale. We sent the attached, and then it was transitioned to Tamara, who received the signed SOW in June. \nUlteig is closed won. I don\u2019t see this quote in Compas. \n@Melissa Neu\n, can you confirm? \nThere was confusion with the consultant about whether the attached signed proposal is the same as a SOW. I\u2019ve confirmed with Andrea and discussed with Chuck that she will still need to create an SOW; it doesn\u2019t look like she has done so yet. However, per the attached, the client has committed and signed. \nShould Hannah be paid for the proposals sent after her departure date? (UL LLC, Bright Horizons, nVent, Hopechicago) If not, then the number of proposals for her is 33 (also excluding The Ad Council), which is one short of qualifying for the bonus of 34 total proposals sent for the QTR to qualify. \nHannah worked on Bright Horizons and HopeChicago.\u00a0 Hannah helped build the HopeChicago proposal, but I presented it to the client after she left. Also, the date isn\u2019t accurate for UL, LLC.in HubSpot. The deal was created well after the original proposal was sent on 5/9. I\u2019ll get HubSpot fixed, and I\u2019m attaching the proposal for your records.\n\u00a0\nThank you,\nJennifer\n\u00a0\nFrom:\n Melissa Neu <\nm.neu@lcwmail.com\n> \nSent:\n Thursday, July 6, 2023 7:25 PM\nTo:\n Alisa Kolodizner <\na.kolodizner@lcwmail.com\n>; Jennifer Barbieri <\nj.barbieri@lcwmail.com\n>; Chuck Adams <\nc.adams@lcwmail.com\n>\nCc:\n Maria Mercado <\nm.mercado@lcwmail.com\n>; Briza Cardenas <\nb.cardenas@lcwmail.com\n>\nSubject:\n RE: Bonus Payout -BD Team\n\u00a0\nHi Everyone,\n\u00a0\nPlease see the attached report with updates.

Your efforts helped me to review the accuracy of the data as it is being pulled from HubSpot. The report feature I used was not entirely accurate, so I\u2019ve updated the attached report for you today and worked on troubleshooting the issue. The attached has removed any proposals in progress and Deb\u2019s pursuits that we were not involved in. Moog is The only existing client I have record of building a proposal for this quarter.\n\u00a0\nTracking proposals sent by the date is tricky for a few reasons, including that there is no HubSpot reporting feature to pull a deal status change date. Since we don\u2019t only create proposals only in HubSpot and often make proposals that other individual emails to the prospect, this information is typically tracked via email correspondence and notes, I will need to work with Pedro to create a new process that makes the data that you can pull more accurate. \n\u00a0\nOne immediate change is that I\u2019ve created multiple workflows to log the date a deal status is changed to Proposal Sent, Negotiation, and Passed to Consultant. This change will allow folks to quickly look at the left sidebar to see the dates and allow the team to pull a report with the data going forward. Keep in mind it can\u2019t work retroactively; however, it will help Pedro to report progress to you in Q3.\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\nI will work with Pedro to ensure that any changes to the attached are captured in HubSpot by EOB Friday, and I will provide you with a final report at that time.\n\u00a0\nPlease let me know if you have any questions or need additional information.\n\u00a0\nKind regards,\n\u00a0\nMelissa\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\nC.

Please work with Pedro and Rebecca to get this field in Hubspot and populated so you do not have to dig through the data every quarter. There are a lot of missing Quotes in Hubspot. Please also work with Pedro and Rebecca to have a full system of accounting for the proposals sent.\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n2. I understand and appreciate your prospective here. The reasoning behind this bonus was to get the BD team to act quickly in getting proposals answered and out the door. This historically was an issue where proposals would take longer than necessary to respond to.\n\u00a0\n3. The proposal bonus is only paid in the quarter the proposal is sent out and not the stage it sits in Hubspot. So as long as the proposal was sent in Q2, the bonus should be paid and whether it stays \u00a0or moves up the pipeline, is irrelevant. \n\u00a0\n4 and 5 \u2013 \n@Alisa Kolodizner\n and \n@Chuck Adams\n Please weigh in.\n\u00a0\nThank you,\nJennifer\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\nFrom:\n Antonio Jones <\na.jones@lcwmail.com\n> \nSent:\n Tuesday, July 25, 2023 5:06 PM\nTo:\n Jennifer Barbieri <\nj.barbieri@lcwmail.com\n>\nCc:\n Alan Samsky <\nasamsky@sutkermoran.com\n>; Chuck Adams <\nc.adams@lcwmail.com\n>; Alisa Kolodizner <\na.kolodizner@lcwmail.com\n>\nSubject:\n RE: Bonus Payout - BD Team\n\u00a0\nHi Jennifer \u2013 thanks for including me. The calculation makes sense. I have some questions around the process. \u00a0My file is attached. The lines without a controller note I still need to review.\nVerification of proposals sent and signed SOW\u2019s \u2013 as proof of proposals sent, I would expect to see a proposal file sent out on the day listed in the spreadsheet in HubSpot ONLY. Outlook has a function that allows you . For example, Berd LLC lists a proposal sent on 4/7/2023 but I can\u2019t find evidence in HubSpot. this is critical for accounting. Reviewing each bonus line to be paid and proof that we should pay it out.\nIt would be prudent to only pay out bonuses to BD if a proposal is sent and a SOW is signed. Paying out bonuses for proposals sent and jobs not won sends the wrong signal to associates. It incentivizes channel stuffing for bonuses. Sending out proposals that aren\u2019t likely to be won.\nWe should not pay bonuses for these stages: negotiation, passed to consultant, proposal in progress, and closed lost. These all represent steps in the sales process and do not indicate that we will receive any money to pay for said bonus paid out. It\u2019ll also cause multiple payments for the same proposal if the proposal extends over more than one quarter. Accounting would also have to compare previous bonus payments to the current period to see if we\u2019re double paying.\nIf we\u2019re in agreement to pay for proposal sent and jobs did not award it would help if we lowered the commission for those, since we aren\u2019t getting any money and the associate is already on salary. They don\u2019t carry the same weight as jobs won.\nClear definition of proposal needed. Does this include a quote, catalog, and or recommendation PowerPoint?\nAntonio Jones\nHe/Him\nController\nLCW\nWebsite\n\u00a0\n|\n\u00a0\nTwitter\n \n|\n\u00a0\nFacebook\n\u00a0\n|\n\u00a0\nLinkedIn\nView our upcoming events\n | \nSign-up for our newsletter\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\nFrom:\n Jennifer Barbieri <\nj.barbieri@lcwmail.com\n> \nSent:\n Monday, July 24, 2023 3:36 PM\nTo:\n Antonio Jones <\na.jones@lcwmail.com\n>\nSubject:\n FW: Bonus Payout -BD Team\n\u00a0\nHi Toni \u2013 can you help me with these commission/proposal bonus payments?

There are a few questions I have here for the team \u2013\n\u00a0\nThe Ad Council proposal date was in 2022, the SOW issue date was in March, and the signed SOW date was 6/8. Should this be eligible for the commission since the proposal and SOW issue date was pre-BD Bonus Structure which started in Q2? It doesn\u2019t qualify for the proposal bonus.\u00a0 \n\u00a0\nIf this commission structure remains, this will need to be clarified and put in writing for Pedro. We were told SOW signature (not for counting towards a proposal creation, but for the percentage of the sale). An SOW is just a proposal until signed, and Hannah is responsible for this sale. We sent the attached, and then it was transitioned to Tamara, who received the signed SOW in June. \nUlteig is closed won. I don\u2019t see this quote in Compas. \n@Melissa Neu\n, can you confirm? \nThere was confusion with the consultant about whether the attached signed proposal is the same as a SOW. I\u2019ve confirmed with Andrea and discussed with Chuck that she will still need to create an SOW; it doesn\u2019t look like she has done so yet. However, per the attached, the client has committed and signed. \nShould Hannah be paid for the proposals sent after her departure date? (UL LLC, Bright Horizons, nVent, Hopechicago) If not, then the number of proposals for her is 33 (also excluding The Ad Council), which is one short of qualifying for the bonus of 34 total proposals sent for the QTR to qualify. \nHannah worked on Bright Horizons and HopeChicago.\u00a0 Hannah helped build the HopeChicago proposal, but I presented it to the client after she left. Also, the date isn\u2019t accurate for UL, LLC.in HubSpot. The deal was created well after the original proposal was sent on 5/9. I\u2019ll get HubSpot fixed, and I\u2019m attaching the proposal for your records.\n\u00a0\nThank you,\nJennifer\n\u00a0\nFrom:\n Melissa Neu <\nm.neu@lcwmail.com\n> \nSent:\n Thursday, July 6, 2023 7:25 PM\nTo:\n Alisa Kolodizner <\na.kolodizner@lcwmail.com\n>; Jennifer Barbieri <\nj.barbieri@lcwmail.com\n>; Chuck Adams <\nc.adams@lcwmail.com\n>\nCc:\n Maria Mercado <\nm.mercado@lcwmail.com\n>; Briza Cardenas <\nb.cardenas@lcwmail.com\n>\nSubject:\n RE: Bonus Payout -BD Team\n\u00a0\nHi Everyone,\n\u00a0\nPlease see the attached report with updates.

Your efforts helped me to review the accuracy of the data as it is being pulled from HubSpot. The report feature I used was not entirely accurate, so I\u2019ve updated the attached report for you today and worked on troubleshooting the issue. The attached has removed any proposals in progress and Deb\u2019s pursuits that we were not involved in. Moog is The only existing client I have record of building a proposal for this quarter.\n\u00a0\nTracking proposals sent by the date is tricky for a few reasons, including that there is no HubSpot reporting feature to pull a deal status change date. Since we don\u2019t only create proposals only in HubSpot and often make proposals that other individual emails to the prospect, this information is typically tracked via email correspondence and notes, I will need to work with Pedro to create a new process that makes the data that you can pull more accurate. \n\u00a0\nOne immediate change is that I\u2019ve created multiple workflows to log the date a deal status is changed to Proposal Sent, Negotiation, and Passed to Consultant. This change will allow folks to quickly look at the left sidebar to see the dates and allow the team to pull a report with the data going forward. Keep in mind it can\u2019t work retroactively; however, it will help Pedro to report progress to you in Q3.\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\nI will work with Pedro to ensure that any changes to the attached are captured in HubSpot by EOB Friday, and I will provide you with a final report at that time.\n\u00a0\nPlease let me know if you have any questions or need additional information.\n\u00a0\nKind regards,\n\u00a0\nMelissa\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\nC.

The reasoning behind this bonus was to get the BD team to act quickly in getting proposals answered and out the door. This historically was an issue where proposals would take longer than necessary to respond to.\n\u00a0\n3. The proposal bonus is only paid in the quarter the proposal is sent out and not the stage it sits in Hubspot.

The calculation makes sense. I have some questions around the process. \u00a0My file is attached. The lines without a controller note I still need to review.\nVerification of proposals sent and signed SOW\u2019s \u2013 as proof of proposals sent, I would expect to see a proposal file sent out on the day listed in the spreadsheet in HubSpot ONLY. Outlook has a function that allows you . For example, Berd LLC lists a proposal sent on 4/7/2023 but I can\u2019t find evidence in HubSpot. this is critical for accounting. Reviewing each bonus line to be paid and proof that we should pay it out.\nIt would be prudent to only pay out bonuses to BD if a proposal is sent and a SOW is signed. Paying out bonuses for proposals sent and jobs not won sends the wrong signal to associates. It incentivizes channel stuffing for bonuses. Sending out proposals that aren\u2019t likely to be won.\nWe should not pay bonuses for these stages: negotiation, passed to consultant, proposal in progress, and closed lost. These all represent steps in the sales process and do not indicate that we will receive any money to pay for said bonus paid out. It\u2019ll also cause multiple payments for the same proposal if the proposal extends over more than one quarter. Accounting would also have to compare previous bonus payments to the current period to see if we\u2019re double paying.\nIf we\u2019re in agreement to pay for proposal sent and jobs did not award it would help if we lowered the commission for those, since we aren\u2019t getting any money and the associate is already on salary. They don\u2019t carry the same weight as jobs won.\nClear definition of proposal needed. Does this include a quote, catalog, and or recommendation PowerPoint?\nAntonio Jones\nHe/Him\nController\nLCW\nWebsite\n\u00a0\n|\n\u00a0\nTwitter\n \n|\n\u00a0\nFacebook\n\u00a0\n|\n\u00a0\nLinkedIn\nView our upcoming events\n | \nSign-up for our newsletter\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\nFrom:\n Jennifer Barbieri <\nj.barbieri@lcwmail.com\n> \nSent:\n Monday, July 24, 2023 3:36 PM\nTo:\n Antonio Jones <\na.jones@lcwmail.com\n>\nSubject:\n FW: Bonus Payout -BD Team\n\u00a0\nHi Toni \u2013 can you help me with these commission/proposal bonus payments?

There are a few questions I have here for the team \u2013\n\u00a0\nThe Ad Council proposal date was in 2022, the SOW issue date was in March, and the signed SOW date was 6/8. Should this be eligible for the commission since the proposal and SOW issue date was pre-BD Bonus Structure which started in Q2? It doesn\u2019t qualify for the proposal bonus.\u00a0 \n\u00a0\nIf this commission structure remains, this will need to be clarified and put in writing for Pedro. We were told SOW signature (not for counting towards a proposal creation, but for the percentage of the sale). An SOW is just a proposal until signed, and Hannah is responsible for this sale. We sent the attached, and then it was transitioned to Tamara, who received the signed SOW in June. \nUlteig is closed won. I don\u2019t see this quote in Compas. \n@Melissa Neu\n, can you confirm? \nThere was confusion with the consultant about whether the attached signed proposal is the same as a SOW. I\u2019ve confirmed with Andrea and discussed with Chuck that she will still need to create an SOW; it doesn\u2019t look like she has done so yet. However, per the attached, the client has committed and signed. \nShould Hannah be paid for the proposals sent after her departure date? (UL LLC, Bright Horizons, nVent, Hopechicago) If not, then the number of proposals for her is 33 (also excluding The Ad Council), which is one short of qualifying for the bonus of 34 total proposals sent for the QTR to qualify. \nHannah worked on Bright Horizons and HopeChicago.\u00a0 Hannah helped build the HopeChicago proposal, but I presented it to the client after she left. Also, the date isn\u2019t accurate for UL, LLC.in HubSpot. The deal was created well after the original proposal was sent on 5/9. I\u2019ll get HubSpot fixed, and I\u2019m attaching the proposal for your records.\n\u00a0\nThank you,\nJennifer\n\u00a0\nFrom:\n Melissa Neu <\nm.neu@lcwmail.com\n> \nSent:\n Thursday, July 6, 2023 7:25 PM\nTo:\n Alisa Kolodizner <\na.kolodizner@lcwmail.com\n>; Jennifer Barbieri <\nj.barbieri@lcwmail.com\n>; Chuck Adams <\nc.adams@lcwmail.com\n>\nCc:\n Maria Mercado <\nm.mercado@lcwmail.com\n>; Briza Cardenas <\nb.cardenas@lcwmail.com\n>\nSubject:\n RE: Bonus Payout -BD Team\n\u00a0\nHi Everyone,\n\u00a0\nPlease see the attached report with updates.

Your efforts helped me to review the accuracy of the data as it is being pulled from HubSpot. The report feature I used was not entirely accurate, so I\u2019ve updated the attached report for you today and worked on troubleshooting the issue. The attached has removed any proposals in progress and Deb\u2019s pursuits that we were not involved in. Moog is The only existing client I have record of building a proposal for this quarter.\n\u00a0\nTracking proposals sent by the date is tricky for a few reasons, including that there is no HubSpot reporting feature to pull a deal status change date. Since we don\u2019t only create proposals only in HubSpot and often make proposals that other individual emails to the prospect, this information is typically tracked via email correspondence and notes, I will need to work with Pedro to create a new process that makes the data that you can pull more accurate. \n\u00a0\nOne immediate change is that I\u2019ve created multiple workflows to log the date a deal status is changed to Proposal Sent, Negotiation, and Passed to Consultant. This change will allow folks to quickly look at the left sidebar to see the dates and allow the team to pull a report with the data going forward. Keep in mind it can\u2019t work retroactively; however, it will help Pedro to report progress to you in Q3.\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\nI will work with Pedro to ensure that any changes to the attached are captured in HubSpot by EOB Friday, and I will provide you with a final report at that time.\n\u00a0\nPlease let me know if you have any questions or need additional information.\n\u00a0\nKind regards,\n\u00a0\nMelissa\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\nC.

Let\u2019s discuss the following:\n\u00a0\nAccording to Hubspot, I see 2 more accounts that Deb is handling (Women Lift Health and Upwardly Global) to make a total of 4. If we exclude all of Deb\u2019s accounts with the exception of Pfizer per your note, the total number of accounts are now 32 which is less than the 34 minimum to qualify for the bonus\nI added in a column for Date Proposal Sent. There are some accounts which do not have a proposal attachment in Hubspot and I don\u2019t know when the proposal was actually sent. Please fill in the missing information so we can evaluate these accounts\nThe bonus specifically states proposals sent. I don\u2019t think we should be including the proposal in progress stage. There are 3 here on the list \n@Alisa Kolodizner\n and \n@Chuck Adams\n please weigh in here\nCommissions are based on executed SOWs so the only account eligible to be paid out commissions on is Insight.

There are a few questions I have here for the team \u2013\n\u00a0\nThe Ad Council proposal date was in 2022, the SOW issue date was in March, and the signed SOW date was 6/8. Should this be eligible for the commission since the proposal and SOW issue date was pre-BD Bonus Structure which started in Q2? It doesn\u2019t qualify for the proposal bonus.\u00a0 \n\u00a0\nIf this commission structure remains, this will need to be clarified and put in writing for Pedro. We were told SOW signature (not for counting towards a proposal creation, but for the percentage of the sale). An SOW is just a proposal until signed, and Hannah is responsible for this sale. We sent the attached, and then it was transitioned to Tamara, who received the signed SOW in June. \nWhat are we paying them for? If it is for proposal then this one seems to exist outside of the agreed timeframe. If it is for SOW signature then it seems to fall well within the timeframe for counting it. Am I missing something else here?\nUlteig is closed won. I don\u2019t see this quote in Compas. \n@Melissa Neu\n, can you confirm? \nThere was confusion with the consultant about whether the attached signed proposal is the same as a SOW. I\u2019ve confirmed with Andrea and discussed with Chuck that she will still need to create an SOW; it doesn\u2019t look like she has done so yet. However, per the attached, the client has committed and signed. \nShould Hannah be paid for the proposals sent after her departure date? (UL LLC, Bright Horizons, nVent, Hopechicago) If not, then the number of proposals for her is 33 (also excluding The Ad Council), which is one short of qualifying for the bonus of 34 total proposals sent for the QTR to qualify. \nHannah worked on Bright Horizons and HopeChicago.\u00a0 Hannah helped build the HopeChicago proposal, but I presented it to the client after she left. Also, the date isn\u2019t accurate for UL, LLC.in HubSpot. The deal was created well after the original proposal was sent on 5/9. I\u2019ll get HubSpot fixed, and I\u2019m attaching the proposal for your records.\n \nIf she was instrumental in getting these in front of the prospect I would reward them to her. It sounds like she was, but the proposals weren\u2019t sent until after she left. As long as we aren\u2019t double paying for these we were going to pay someone, correct?\n\u00a0\nThank you,\nJennifer\n\u00a0\nFrom:\n Melissa Neu <\nm.neu@lcwmail.com\n> \nSent:\n Thursday, July 6, 2023 7:25 PM\nTo:\n Alisa Kolodizner <\na.kolodizner@lcwmail.com\n>; Jennifer Barbieri <\nj.barbieri@lcwmail.com\n>; Chuck Adams <\nc.adams@lcwmail.com\n>\nCc:\n Maria Mercado <\nm.mercado@lcwmail.com\n>; Briza Cardenas <\nb.cardenas@lcwmail.com\n>\nSubject:\n RE: Bonus Payout -BD Team\n\u00a0\nHi Everyone,\n\u00a0\nPlease see the attached report with updates.

Your efforts helped me to review the accuracy of the data as it is being pulled from HubSpot. The report feature I used was not entirely accurate, so I\u2019ve updated the attached report for you today and worked on troubleshooting the issue. The attached has removed any proposals in progress and Deb\u2019s pursuits that we were not involved in. Moog is The only existing client I have record of building a proposal for this quarter.\n\u00a0\nTracking proposals sent by the date is tricky for a few reasons, including that there is no HubSpot reporting feature to pull a deal status change date. Since we don\u2019t only create proposals only in HubSpot and often make proposals that other individual emails to the prospect, this information is typically tracked via email correspondence and notes, I will need to work with Pedro to create a new process that makes the data that you can pull more accurate. \n\u00a0\nOne immediate change is that I\u2019ve created multiple workflows to log the date a deal status is changed to Proposal Sent, Negotiation, and Passed to Consultant. This change will allow folks to quickly look at the left sidebar to see the dates and allow the team to pull a report with the data going forward. Keep in mind it can\u2019t work retroactively; however, it will help Pedro to report progress to you in Q3.\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\nI will work with Pedro to ensure that any changes to the attached are captured in HubSpot by EOB Friday, and I will provide you with a final report at that time.\n\u00a0\nPlease let me know if you have any questions or need additional information.\n\u00a0\nKind regards,\n\u00a0\nMelissa\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\nC.

The calculation makes sense. I have some questions around the process. \u00a0My file is attached. The lines without a controller note I still need to review.\nVerification of proposals sent and signed SOW\u2019s \u2013 as proof of proposals sent, I would expect to see a proposal file sent out on the day listed in the spreadsheet in HubSpot ONLY. Outlook has a function that allows you . For example, Berd LLC lists a proposal sent on 4/7/2023 but I can\u2019t find evidence in HubSpot. this is critical for accounting. Reviewing each bonus line to be paid and proof that we should pay it out.\nIt would be prudent to only pay out bonuses to BD if a proposal is sent and a SOW is signed. Paying out bonuses for proposals sent and jobs not won sends the wrong signal to associates. It incentivizes channel stuffing for bonuses. Sending out proposals that aren\u2019t likely to be won.\nWe should not pay bonuses for these stages: negotiation, passed to consultant, proposal in progress, and closed lost. These all represent steps in the sales process and do not indicate that we will receive any money to pay for said bonus paid out. It\u2019ll also cause multiple payments for the same proposal if the proposal extends over more than one quarter. Accounting would also have to compare previous bonus payments to the current period to see if we\u2019re double paying.\nIf we\u2019re in agreement to pay for proposal sent and jobs did not award it would help if we lowered the commission for those, since we aren\u2019t getting any money and the associate is already on salary. They don\u2019t carry the same weight as jobs won.\nClear definition of proposal needed. Does this include a quote, catalog, and or recommendation PowerPoint?\nAntonio Jones\nHe/Him\nController\nLCW\nWebsite\n\u00a0\n|\n\u00a0\nTwitter\n \n|\n\u00a0\nFacebook\n\u00a0\n|\n\u00a0\nLinkedIn\nView our upcoming events\n | \nSign-up for our newsletter\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\nFrom:\n Jennifer Barbieri <\nj.barbieri@lcwmail.com\n> \nSent:\n Monday, July 24, 2023 3:36 PM\nTo:\n Antonio Jones <\na.jones@lcwmail.com\n>\nSubject:\n FW: Bonus Payout -BD Team\n\u00a0\nHi Toni \u2013 can you help me with these commission/proposal bonus payments?

There are a few questions I have here for the team \u2013\n\u00a0\nThe Ad Council proposal date was in 2022, the SOW issue date was in March, and the signed SOW date was 6/8. Should this be eligible for the commission since the proposal and SOW issue date was pre-BD Bonus Structure which started in Q2? It doesn\u2019t qualify for the proposal bonus.\u00a0 \n\u00a0\nIf this commission structure remains, this will need to be clarified and put in writing for Pedro. We were told SOW signature (not for counting towards a proposal creation, but for the percentage of the sale). An SOW is just a proposal until signed, and Hannah is responsible for this sale. We sent the attached, and then it was transitioned to Tamara, who received the signed SOW in June. \nUlteig is closed won. I don\u2019t see this quote in Compas. \n@Melissa Neu\n, can you confirm? \nThere was confusion with the consultant about whether the attached signed proposal is the same as a SOW. I\u2019ve confirmed with Andrea and discussed with Chuck that she will still need to create an SOW; it doesn\u2019t look like she has done so yet. However, per the attached, the client has committed and signed. \nShould Hannah be paid for the proposals sent after her departure date? (UL LLC, Bright Horizons, nVent, Hopechicago) If not, then the number of proposals for her is 33 (also excluding The Ad Council), which is one short of qualifying for the bonus of 34 total proposals sent for the QTR to qualify. \nHannah worked on Bright Horizons and HopeChicago.\u00a0 Hannah helped build the HopeChicago proposal, but I presented it to the client after she left. Also, the date isn\u2019t accurate for UL, LLC.in HubSpot. The deal was created well after the original proposal was sent on 5/9. I\u2019ll get HubSpot fixed, and I\u2019m attaching the proposal for your records.\n\u00a0\nThank you,\nJennifer\n\u00a0\nFrom:\n Melissa Neu <\nm.neu@lcwmail.com\n> \nSent:\n Thursday, July 6, 2023 7:25 PM\nTo:\n Alisa Kolodizner <\na.kolodizner@lcwmail.com\n>; Jennifer Barbieri <\nj.barbieri@lcwmail.com\n>; Chuck Adams <\nc.adams@lcwmail.com\n>\nCc:\n Maria Mercado <\nm.mercado@lcwmail.com\n>; Briza Cardenas <\nb.cardenas@lcwmail.com\n>\nSubject:\n RE: Bonus Payout -BD Team\n\u00a0\nHi Everyone,\n\u00a0\nPlease see the attached report with updates.

Your efforts helped me to review the accuracy of the data as it is being pulled from HubSpot. The report feature I used was not entirely accurate, so I\u2019ve updated the attached report for you today and worked on troubleshooting the issue. The attached has removed any proposals in progress and Deb\u2019s pursuits that we were not involved in. Moog is The only existing client I have record of building a proposal for this quarter.\n\u00a0\nTracking proposals sent by the date is tricky for a few reasons, including that there is no HubSpot reporting feature to pull a deal status change date. Since we don\u2019t only create proposals only in HubSpot and often make proposals that other individual emails to the prospect, this information is typically tracked via email correspondence and notes, I will need to work with Pedro to create a new process that makes the data that you can pull more accurate. \n\u00a0\nOne immediate change is that I\u2019ve created multiple workflows to log the date a deal status is changed to Proposal Sent, Negotiation, and Passed to Consultant. This change will allow folks to quickly look at the left sidebar to see the dates and allow the team to pull a report with the data going forward. Keep in mind it can\u2019t work retroactively; however, it will help Pedro to report progress to you in Q3.\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\nI will work with Pedro to ensure that any changes to the attached are captured in HubSpot by EOB Friday, and I will provide you with a final report at that time.\n\u00a0\nPlease let me know if you have any questions or need additional information.\n\u00a0\nKind regards,\n\u00a0\nMelissa\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\nC.

    "body": "Hi Jennifer \u2013 thanks for including me. The calculation makes sense. I have some questions around the process. \u00a0My file is attached. The lines without a controller note I still need to review.\nVerification of proposals sent and signed SOW\u2019s \u2013 as proof of proposals sent, I would expect to see a proposal file sent out on the day listed in the spreadsheet in HubSpot ONLY. Outlook has a function that allows you . For example, Berd LLC lists a proposal sent on 4/7/2023 but I can\u2019t find evidence in HubSpot. this is critical for accounting. Reviewing each bonus line to be paid and proof that we should pay it out.\nIt would be prudent to only pay out bonuses to BD if a proposal is sent and a SOW is signed. Paying out bonuses for proposals sent and jobs not won sends the wrong signal to associates. It incentivizes channel stuffing for bonuses. Sending out proposals that aren\u2019t likely to be won.\nWe should not pay bonuses for these stages: negotiation, passed to consultant, proposal in progress, and closed lost. These all represent steps in the sales process and do not indicate that we will receive any money to pay for said bonus paid out. It\u2019ll also cause multiple payments for the same proposal if the proposal extends over more than one quarter. Accounting would also have to compare previous bonus payments to the current period to see if we\u2019re double paying.\nIf we\u2019re in agreement to pay for proposal sent and jobs did not award it would help if we lowered the commission for those, since we aren\u2019t getting any money and the associate is already on salary. They don\u2019t carry the same weight as jobs won.\nClear definition of proposal needed.

There are a few questions I have here for the team \u2013\n\u00a0\nThe Ad Council proposal date was in 2022, the SOW issue date was in March, and the signed SOW date was 6/8. Should this be eligible for the commission since the proposal and SOW issue date was pre-BD Bonus Structure which started in Q2? It doesn\u2019t qualify for the proposal bonus.\u00a0 \n\u00a0\nIf this commission structure remains, this will need to be clarified and put in writing for Pedro. We were told SOW signature (not for counting towards a proposal creation, but for the percentage of the sale). An SOW is just a proposal until signed, and Hannah is responsible for this sale.

There are a few questions I have here for the team \u2013\n\u00a0\nThe Ad Council proposal date was in 2022, the SOW issue date was in March, and the signed SOW date was 6/8. Should this be eligible for the commission since the proposal and SOW issue date was pre-BD Bonus Structure which started in Q2? It doesn\u2019t qualify for the proposal bonus.\u00a0 \n\u00a0\nIf this commission structure remains, this will need to be clarified and put in writing for Pedro. We were told SOW signature (not for counting towards a proposal creation, but for the percentage of the sale). An SOW is just a proposal until signed, and Hannah is responsible for this sale. We sent the attached, and then it was transitioned to Tamara, who received the signed SOW in June. \nWhat are we paying them for? If it is for proposal then this one seems to exist outside of the agreed timeframe. If it is for SOW signature then it seems to fall well within the timeframe for counting it. Am I missing something else here?\nUlteig is closed won. I don\u2019t see this quote in Compas. \n@Melissa Neu\n, can you confirm? \nThere was confusion with the consultant about whether the attached signed proposal is the same as a SOW. I\u2019ve confirmed with Andrea and discussed with Chuck that she will still need to create an SOW; it doesn\u2019t look like she has done so yet. However, per the attached, the client has committed and signed. \nShould Hannah be paid for the proposals sent after her departure date? (UL LLC, Bright Horizons, nVent, Hopechicago) If not, then the number of proposals for her is 33 (also excluding The Ad Council), which is one short of qualifying for the bonus of 34 total proposals sent for the QTR to qualify. \nHannah worked on Bright Horizons and HopeChicago.\u00a0 Hannah helped build the HopeChicago proposal, but I presented it to the client after she left. Also, the date isn\u2019t accurate for UL, LLC.in HubSpot. The deal was created well after the original proposal was sent on 5/9. I\u2019ll get HubSpot fixed, and I\u2019m attaching the proposal for your records.\n \nIf she was instrumental in getting these in front of the prospect I would reward them to her. It sounds like she was, but the proposals weren\u2019t sent until after she left. As long as we aren\u2019t double paying for these we were going to pay someone, correct?\n\u00a0\nThank you,\nJennifer\n\u00a0\nFrom:\n Melissa Neu <\nm.neu@lcwmail.com\n> \nSent:\n Thursday, July 6, 2023 7:25 PM\nTo:\n Alisa Kolodizner <\na.kolodizner@lcwmail.com\n>; Jennifer Barbieri <\nj.barbieri@lcwmail.com\n>; Chuck Adams <\nc.adams@lcwmail.com\n>\nCc:\n Maria Mercado <\nm.mercado@lcwmail.com\n>; Briza Cardenas <\nb.cardenas@lcwmail.com\n>\nSubject:\n RE: Bonus Payout -BD Team\n\u00a0\nHi Everyone,\n\u00a0\nPlease see the attached report with updates.

Keep in mind it can\u2019t work retroactively; however, it will help Pedro to report progress to you in Q3.\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\nI will work with Pedro to ensure that any changes to the attached are captured in HubSpot by EOB Friday, and I will provide you with a final report at that time.\n\u00a0\nPlease let me know if you have any questions or need additional information.\n\u00a0\nKind regards,\n\u00a0\nMelissa\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\nC.

Let\u2019s discuss the following:\n\u00a0\nAccording to Hubspot, I see 2 more accounts that Deb is handling (Women Lift Health and Upwardly Global) to make a total of 4. If we exclude all of Deb\u2019s accounts with the exception of Pfizer per your note, the total number of accounts are now 32 which is less than the 34 minimum to qualify for the bonus\nI added in a column for Date Proposal Sent. There are some accounts which do not have a proposal attachment in Hubspot and I don\u2019t know when the proposal was actually sent. Please fill in the missing information so we can evaluate these accounts\nThe bonus specifically states proposals sent. I don\u2019t think we should be including the proposal in progress stage. There are 3 here on the list \n@Alisa Kolodizner\n and \n@Chuck Adams\n please weigh in here\nCommissions are based on executed SOWs so the only account eligible to be paid out commissions on is Insight.

It doesn\u2019t qualify for the proposal bonus.\u00a0 \n\u00a0\nIf this commission structure remains, this will need to be clarified and put in writing for Pedro. We were told SOW signature (not for counting towards a proposal creation, but for the percentage of the sale). An SOW is just a proposal until signed, and Hannah is responsible for this sale. We sent the attached, and then it was transitioned to Tamara, who received the signed SOW in June. \nUlteig is closed won. I don\u2019t see this quote in Compas. \n@Melissa Neu\n, can you confirm? \nThere was confusion with the consultant about whether the attached signed proposal is the same as a SOW. I\u2019ve confirmed with Andrea and discussed with Chuck that she will still need to create an SOW; it doesn\u2019t look like she has done so yet. However, per the attached, the client has committed and signed. \nShould Hannah be paid for the proposals sent after her departure date? (UL LLC, Bright Horizons, nVent, Hopechicago) If not, then the number of proposals for her is 33 (also excluding The Ad Council), which is one short of qualifying for the bonus of 34 total proposals sent for the QTR to qualify. \nHannah worked on Bright Horizons and HopeChicago.\u00a0 Hannah helped build the HopeChicago proposal, but I presented it to the client after she left. Also, the date isn\u2019t accurate for UL, LLC.in HubSpot. The deal was created well after the original proposal was sent on 5/9. I\u2019ll get HubSpot fixed, and I\u2019m attaching the proposal for your records.\n\u00a0\nThank you,\nJennifer\n\u00a0\nFrom:\n Melissa Neu <\nm.neu@lcwmail.com\n> \nSent:\n Thursday, July 6, 2023 7:25 PM\nTo:\n Alisa Kolodizner <\na.kolodizner@lcwmail.com\n>; Jennifer Barbieri <\nj.barbieri@lcwmail.com\n>; Chuck Adams <\nc.adams@lcwmail.com\n>\nCc:\n Maria Mercado <\nm.mercado@lcwmail.com\n>; Briza Cardenas <\nb.cardenas@lcwmail.com\n>\nSubject:\n RE: Bonus Payout -BD Team\n\u00a0\nHi Everyone,\n\u00a0\nPlease see the attached report with updates.

Your efforts helped me to review the accuracy of the data as it is being pulled from HubSpot. The report feature I used was not entirely accurate, so I\u2019ve updated the attached report for you today and worked on troubleshooting the issue. The attached has removed any proposals in progress and Deb\u2019s pursuits that we were not involved in. Moog is The only existing client I have record of building a proposal for this quarter.\n\u00a0\nTracking proposals sent by the date is tricky for a few reasons, including that there is no HubSpot reporting feature to pull a deal status change date. Since we don\u2019t only create proposals only in HubSpot and often make proposals that other individual emails to the prospect, this information is typically tracked via email correspondence and notes, I will need to work with Pedro to create a new process that makes the data that you can pull more accurate. \n\u00a0\nOne immediate change is that I\u2019ve created multiple workflows to log the date a deal status is changed to Proposal Sent, Negotiation, and Passed to Consultant. This change will allow folks to quickly look at the left sidebar to see the dates and allow the team to pull a report with the data going forward. Keep in mind it can\u2019t work retroactively; however, it will help Pedro to report progress to you in Q3.\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\nI will work with Pedro to ensure that any changes to the attached are captured in HubSpot by EOB Friday, and I will provide you with a final report at that time.\n\u00a0\nPlease let me know if you have any questions or need additional information.\n\u00a0\nKind regards,\n\u00a0\nMelissa\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\nC.

If we exclude all of Deb\u2019s accounts with the exception of Pfizer per your note, the total number of accounts are now 32 which is less than the 34 minimum to qualify for the bonus\nI added in a column for Date Proposal Sent. There are some accounts which do not have a proposal attachment in Hubspot and I don\u2019t know when the proposal was actually sent. Please fill in the missing information so we can evaluate these accounts\nThe bonus specifically states proposals sent. I don\u2019t think we should be including the proposal in progress stage. There are 3 here on the list \n@Alisa Kolodizner\n and \n@Chuck Adams\n please weigh in here\nCommissions are based on executed SOWs so the only account eligible to be paid out commissions on is Insight.

There are a few questions I have here for the team \u2013\n\u00a0\nThe Ad Council proposal date was in 2022, the SOW issue date was in March, and the signed SOW date was 6/8. Should this be eligible for the commission since the proposal and SOW issue date was pre-BD Bonus Structure which started in Q2? It doesn\u2019t qualify for the proposal bonus.\u00a0 \n\u00a0\nIf this commission structure remains, this will need to be clarified and put in writing for Pedro. We were told SOW signature (not for counting towards a proposal creation, but for the percentage of the sale). An SOW is just a proposal until signed, and Hannah is responsible for this sale. We sent the attached, and then it was transitioned to Tamara, who received the signed SOW in June. \nUlteig is closed won. I don\u2019t see this quote in Compas. \n@Melissa Neu\n, can you confirm? \nThere was confusion with the consultant about whether the attached signed proposal is the same as a SOW. I\u2019ve confirmed with Andrea and discussed with Chuck that she will still need to create an SOW; it doesn\u2019t look like she has done so yet. However, per the attached, the client has committed and signed. \nShould Hannah be paid for the proposals sent after her departure date? (UL LLC, Bright Horizons, nVent, Hopechicago) If not, then the number of proposals for her is 33 (also excluding The Ad Council), which is one short of qualifying for the bonus of 34 total proposals sent for the QTR to qualify. \nHannah worked on Bright Horizons and HopeChicago.\u00a0 Hannah helped build the HopeChicago proposal, but I presented it to the client after she left. Also, the date isn\u2019t accurate for UL, LLC.in HubSpot. The deal was created well after the original proposal was sent on 5/9.

Your efforts helped me to review the accuracy of the data as it is being pulled from HubSpot. The report feature I used was not entirely accurate, so I\u2019ve updated the attached report for you today and worked on troubleshooting the issue. The attached has removed any proposals in progress and Deb\u2019s pursuits that we were not involved in. Moog is The only existing client I have record of building a proposal for this quarter.\n\u00a0\nTracking proposals sent by the date is tricky for a few reasons, including that there is no HubSpot reporting feature to pull a deal status change date. Since we don\u2019t only create proposals only in HubSpot and often make proposals that other individual emails to the prospect, this information is typically tracked via email correspondence and notes, I will need to work with Pedro to create a new process that makes the data that you can pull more accurate. \n\u00a0\nOne immediate change is that I\u2019ve created multiple workflows to log the date a deal status is changed to Proposal Sent, Negotiation, and Passed to Consultant. This change will allow folks to quickly look at the left sidebar to see the dates and allow the team to pull a report with the data going forward. Keep in mind it can\u2019t work retroactively; however, it will help Pedro to report progress to you in Q3.\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\nI will work with Pedro to ensure that any changes to the attached are captured in HubSpot by EOB Friday, and I will provide you with a final report at that time.\n\u00a0\nPlease let me know if you have any questions or need additional information.\n\u00a0\nKind regards,\n\u00a0\nMelissa\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\nC.

Your efforts helped me to review the accuracy of the data as it is being pulled from HubSpot. The report feature I used was not entirely accurate, so I\u2019ve updated the attached report for you today and worked on troubleshooting the issue. The attached has removed any proposals in progress and Deb\u2019s pursuits that we were not involved in. Moog is The only existing client I have record of building a proposal for this quarter.\n\u00a0\nTracking proposals sent by the date is tricky for a few reasons, including that there is no HubSpot reporting feature to pull a deal status change date. Since we don\u2019t only create proposals only in HubSpot and often make proposals that other individual emails to the prospect, this information is typically tracked via email correspondence and notes, I will need to work with Pedro to create a new process that makes the data that you can pull more accurate. \n\u00a0\nOne immediate change is that I\u2019ve created multiple workflows to log the date a deal status is changed to Proposal Sent, Negotiation, and Passed to Consultant. This change will allow folks to quickly look at the left sidebar to see the dates and allow the team to pull a report with the data going forward. Keep in mind it can\u2019t work retroactively; however, it will help Pedro to report progress to you in Q3.\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\nI will work with Pedro to ensure that any changes to the attached are captured in HubSpot by EOB Friday, and I will provide you with a final report at that time.\n\u00a0\nPlease let me know if you have any questions or need additional information.\n\u00a0\nKind regards,\n\u00a0\nMelissa\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\nC.

If we exclude all of Deb\u2019s accounts with the exception of Pfizer per your note, the total number of accounts are now 32 which is less than the 34 minimum to qualify for the bonus\nI added in a column for Date Proposal Sent. There are some accounts which do not have a proposal attachment in Hubspot and I don\u2019t know when the proposal was actually sent. Please fill in the missing information so we can evaluate these accounts\nThe bonus specifically states proposals sent. I don\u2019t think we should be including the proposal in progress stage. There are 3 here on the list \n@Alisa Kolodizner\n and \n@Chuck Adams\n please weigh in here\nCommissions are based on executed SOWs so the only account eligible to be paid out commissions on is Insight.

Your efforts helped me to review the accuracy of the data as it is being pulled from HubSpot. The report feature I used was not entirely accurate, so I\u2019ve updated the attached report for you today and worked on troubleshooting the issue. The attached has removed any proposals in progress and Deb\u2019s pursuits that we were not involved in. Moog is The only existing client I have record of building a proposal for this quarter.\n\u00a0\nTracking proposals sent by the date is tricky for a few reasons, including that there is no HubSpot reporting feature to pull a deal status change date. Since we don\u2019t only create proposals only in HubSpot and often make proposals that other individual emails to the prospect, this information is typically tracked via email correspondence and notes, I will need to work with Pedro to create a new process that makes the data that you can pull more accurate. \n\u00a0\nOne immediate change is that I\u2019ve created multiple workflows to log the date a deal status is changed to Proposal Sent, Negotiation, and Passed to Consultant. This change will allow folks to quickly look at the left sidebar to see the dates and allow the team to pull a report with the data going forward. Keep in mind it can\u2019t work retroactively; however, it will help Pedro to report progress to you in Q3.\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\nI will work with Pedro to ensure that any changes to the attached are captured in HubSpot by EOB Friday, and I will provide you with a final report at that time.\n\u00a0\nPlease let me know if you have any questions or need additional information.\n\u00a0\nKind regards,\n\u00a0\nMelissa\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\nC.

There are a few questions I have here for the team \u2013\n\u00a0\nThe Ad Council proposal date was in 2022, the SOW issue date was in March, and the signed SOW date was 6/8. Should this be eligible for the commission since the proposal and SOW issue date was pre-BD Bonus Structure which started in Q2? It doesn\u2019t qualify for the proposal bonus.\u00a0 \n\u00a0\nIf this commission structure remains, this will need to be clarified and put in writing for Pedro. We were told SOW signature (not for counting towards a proposal creation, but for the percentage of the sale). An SOW is just a proposal until signed, and Hannah is responsible for this sale. We sent the attached, and then it was transitioned to Tamara, who received the signed SOW in June. \nUlteig is closed won. I don\u2019t see this quote in Compas. \n@Melissa Neu\n, can you confirm? \nThere was confusion with the consultant about whether the attached signed proposal is the same as a SOW. I\u2019ve confirmed with Andrea and discussed with Chuck that she will still need to create an SOW; it doesn\u2019t look like she has done so yet. However, per the attached, the client has committed and signed. \nShould Hannah be paid for the proposals sent after her departure date? (UL LLC, Bright Horizons, nVent, Hopechicago) If not, then the number of proposals for her is 33 (also excluding The Ad Council), which is one short of qualifying for the bonus of 34 total proposals sent for the QTR to qualify. \nHannah worked on Bright Horizons and HopeChicago.\u00a0 Hannah helped build the HopeChicago proposal, but I presented it to the client after she left. Also, the date isn\u2019t accurate for UL, LLC.in HubSpot. The deal was created well after the original proposal was sent on 5/9. I\u2019ll get HubSpot fixed, and I\u2019m attaching the proposal for your records.\n\u00a0\nThank you,\nJennifer\n\u00a0\nFrom:\n Melissa Neu <\nm.neu@lcwmail.com\n> \nSent:\n Thursday, July 6, 2023 7:25 PM\nTo:\n Alisa Kolodizner <\na.kolodizner@lcwmail.com\n>; Jennifer Barbieri <\nj.barbieri@lcwmail.com\n>; Chuck Adams <\nc.adams@lcwmail.com\n>\nCc:\n Maria Mercado <\nm.mercado@lcwmail.com\n>; Briza Cardenas <\nb.cardenas@lcwmail.com\n>\nSubject:\n RE: Bonus Payout -BD Team\n\u00a0\nHi Everyone,\n\u00a0\nPlease see the attached report with updates.

Your efforts helped me to review the accuracy of the data as it is being pulled from HubSpot. The report feature I used was not entirely accurate, so I\u2019ve updated the attached report for you today and worked on troubleshooting the issue. The attached has removed any proposals in progress and Deb\u2019s pursuits that we were not involved in. Moog is The only existing client I have record of building a proposal for this quarter.\n\u00a0\nTracking proposals sent by the date is tricky for a few reasons, including that there is no HubSpot reporting feature to pull a deal status change date. Since we don\u2019t only create proposals only in HubSpot and often make proposals that other individual emails to the prospect, this information is typically tracked via email correspondence and notes, I will need to work with Pedro to create a new process that makes the data that you can pull more accurate. \n\u00a0\nOne immediate change is that I\u2019ve created multiple workflows to log the date a deal status is changed to Proposal Sent, Negotiation, and Passed to Consultant. This change will allow folks to quickly look at the left sidebar to see the dates and allow the team to pull a report with the data going forward. Keep in mind it can\u2019t work retroactively; however, it will help Pedro to report progress to you in Q3.\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\nI will work with Pedro to ensure that any changes to the attached are captured in HubSpot by EOB Friday, and I will provide you with a final report at that time.\n\u00a0\nPlease let me know if you have any questions or need additional information.\n\u00a0\nKind regards,\n\u00a0\nMelissa\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\nC.

If we exclude all of Deb\u2019s accounts with the exception of Pfizer per your note, the total number of accounts are now 32 which is less than the 34 minimum to qualify for the bonus\nI added in a column for Date Proposal Sent. There are some accounts which do not have a proposal attachment in Hubspot and I don\u2019t know when the proposal was actually sent. Please fill in the missing information so we can evaluate these accounts\nThe bonus specifically states proposals sent. I don\u2019t think we should be including the proposal in progress stage. There are 3 here on the list \n@Alisa Kolodizner\n and \n@Chuck Adams\n please weigh in here\nCommissions are based on executed SOWs so the only account eligible to be paid out commissions on is Insight.

    "body": "Hi,\nReconciliation runs are part of a payroll provider's normal quarter's-end reconciliation process. Zenefits Payroll is running those corrections to ensure you pay the correct amount to each tax jurisdiction where you're liable for payroll taxes.\nWhen we do reconciliations, we look for variances between what we collected in taxes from your pay runs in the quarter and what the tax agencies expect you to pay. In some cases, we'll find variances between these two amounts. Variances are normal, and can be the result of a number of things.\nHere's a snapshot of where you stand, and what will happen next:\nFor your Full-Service jurisdictions, we will automatically create pay runs in your account and you'll see the following net amount \ncredited to \nyour bank account ending in ******6303 by July 11, 2023 for $0.04 for Unemployment Tax.\nFor additional details, please feel free to review your \nAll In One report\n from your Payroll app.\nThanks, \nZenefits \nQuestions or concerns?

There are a few questions I have here for the team \u2013\n\u00a0\nThe Ad Council proposal date was in 2022, the SOW issue date was in March, and the signed SOW date was 6/8. Should this be eligible for the commission since the proposal and SOW issue date was pre-BD Bonus Structure which started in Q2? It doesn\u2019t qualify for the proposal bonus.\u00a0 \n\u00a0\nIf this commission structure remains, this will need to be clarified and put in writing for Pedro. We were told SOW signature (not for counting towards a proposal creation, but for the percentage of the sale). An SOW is just a proposal until signed, and Hannah is responsible for this sale. We sent the attached, and then it was transitioned to Tamara, who received the signed SOW in June. \nUlteig is closed won. I don\u2019t see this quote in Compas. \n@Melissa Neu\n, can you confirm? \nThere was confusion with the consultant about whether the attached signed proposal is the same as a SOW. I\u2019ve confirmed with Andrea and discussed with Chuck that she will still need to create an SOW; it doesn\u2019t look like she has done so yet. However, per the attached, the client has committed and signed. \nShould Hannah be paid for the proposals sent after her departure date? (UL LLC, Bright Horizons, nVent, Hopechicago) If not, then the number of proposals for her is 33 (also excluding The Ad Council), which is one short of qualifying for the bonus of 34 total proposals sent for the QTR to qualify. \nHannah worked on Bright Horizons and HopeChicago.\u00a0 Hannah helped build the HopeChicago proposal, but I presented it to the client after she left. Also, the date isn\u2019t accurate for UL, LLC.in HubSpot. The deal was created well after the original proposal was sent on 5/9. I\u2019ll get HubSpot fixed, and I\u2019m attaching the proposal for your records.\n\u00a0\nThank you,\nJennifer\n\u00a0\nFrom:\n Melissa Neu <\nm.neu@lcwmail.com\n> \nSent:\n Thursday, July 6, 2023 7:25 PM\nTo:\n Alisa Kolodizner <\na.kolodizner@lcwmail.com\n>; Jennifer Barbieri <\nj.barbieri@lcwmail.com\n>; Chuck Adams <\nc.adams@lcwmail.com\n>\nCc:\n Maria Mercado <\nm.mercado@lcwmail.com\n>; Briza Cardenas <\nb.cardenas@lcwmail.com\n>\nSubject:\n RE: Bonus Payout -BD Team\n\u00a0\nHi Everyone,\n\u00a0\nPlease see the attached report with updates.

Your efforts helped me to review the accuracy of the data as it is being pulled from HubSpot. The report feature I used was not entirely accurate, so I\u2019ve updated the attached report for you today and worked on troubleshooting the issue. The attached has removed any proposals in progress and Deb\u2019s pursuits that we were not involved in. Moog is The only existing client I have record of building a proposal for this quarter.\n\u00a0\nTracking proposals sent by the date is tricky for a few reasons, including that there is no HubSpot reporting feature to pull a deal status change date. Since we don\u2019t only create proposals only in HubSpot and often make proposals that other individual emails to the prospect, this information is typically tracked via email correspondence and notes, I will need to work with Pedro to create a new process that makes the data that you can pull more accurate. \n\u00a0\nOne immediate change is that I\u2019ve created multiple workflows to log the date a deal status is changed to Proposal Sent, Negotiation, and Passed to Consultant. This change will allow folks to quickly look at the left sidebar to see the dates and allow the team to pull a report with the data going forward. Keep in mind it can\u2019t work retroactively; however, it will help Pedro to report progress to you in Q3.\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\nI will work with Pedro to ensure that any changes to the attached are captured in HubSpot by EOB Friday, and I will provide you with a final report at that time.\n\u00a0\nPlease let me know if you have any questions or need additional information.\n\u00a0\nKind regards,\n\u00a0\nMelissa\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\nC.

Your efforts helped me to review the accuracy of the data as it is being pulled from HubSpot. The report feature I used was not entirely accurate, so I\u2019ve updated the attached report for you today and worked on troubleshooting the issue. The attached has removed any proposals in progress and Deb\u2019s pursuits that we were not involved in. Moog is The only existing client I have record of building a proposal for this quarter.\n\u00a0\nTracking proposals sent by the date is tricky for a few reasons, including that there is no HubSpot reporting feature to pull a deal status change date. Since we don\u2019t only create proposals only in HubSpot and often make proposals that other individual emails to the prospect, this information is typically tracked via email correspondence and notes, I will need to work with Pedro to create a new process that makes the data that you can pull more accurate. \n\u00a0\nOne immediate change is that I\u2019ve created multiple workflows to log the date a deal status is changed to Proposal Sent, Negotiation, and Passed to Consultant. This change will allow folks to quickly look at the left sidebar to see the dates and allow the team to pull a report with the data going forward. Keep in mind it can\u2019t work retroactively; however, it will help Pedro to report progress to you in Q3.\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\nI will work with Pedro to ensure that any changes to the attached are captured in HubSpot by EOB Friday, and I will provide you with a final report at that time.\n\u00a0\nPlease let me know if you have any questions or need additional information.\n\u00a0\nKind regards,\n\u00a0\nMelissa\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\nC.

Your efforts helped me to review the accuracy of the data as it is being pulled from HubSpot. The report feature I used was not entirely accurate, so I\u2019ve updated the attached report for you today and worked on troubleshooting the issue. The attached has removed any proposals in progress and Deb\u2019s pursuits that we were not involved in. Moog is The only existing client I have record of building a proposal for this quarter.\n\u00a0\nTracking proposals sent by the date is tricky for a few reasons, including that there is no HubSpot reporting feature to pull a deal status change date. Since we don\u2019t only create proposals only in HubSpot and often make proposals that other individual emails to the prospect, this information is typically tracked via email correspondence and notes, I will need to work with Pedro to create a new process that makes the data that you can pull more accurate. \n\u00a0\nOne immediate change is that I\u2019ve created multiple workflows to log the date a deal status is changed to Proposal Sent, Negotiation, and Passed to Consultant. This change will allow folks to quickly look at the left sidebar to see the dates and allow the team to pull a report with the data going forward. Keep in mind it can\u2019t work retroactively; however, it will help Pedro to report progress to you in Q3.\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\nI will work with Pedro to ensure that any changes to the attached are captured in HubSpot by EOB Friday, and I will provide you with a final report at that time.\n\u00a0\nPlease let me know if you have any questions or need additional information.\n\u00a0\nKind regards,\n\u00a0\nMelissa\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\nC.

Please fill in the missing information so we can evaluate these accounts\nThe bonus specifically states proposals sent. I don\u2019t think we should be including the proposal in progress stage.

Your efforts helped me to review the accuracy of the data as it is being pulled from HubSpot. The report feature I used was not entirely accurate, so I\u2019ve updated the attached report for you today and worked on troubleshooting the issue. The attached has removed any proposals in progress and Deb\u2019s pursuits that we were not involved in. Moog is The only existing client I have record of building a proposal for this quarter.\n\u00a0\nTracking proposals sent by the date is tricky for a few reasons, including that there is no HubSpot reporting feature to pull a deal status change date. Since we don\u2019t only create proposals only in HubSpot and often make proposals that other individual emails to the prospect, this information is typically tracked via email correspondence and notes, I will need to work with Pedro to create a new process that makes the data that you can pull more accurate. \n\u00a0\nOne immediate change is that I\u2019ve created multiple workflows to log the date a deal status is changed to Proposal Sent, Negotiation, and Passed to Consultant. This change will allow folks to quickly look at the left sidebar to see the dates and allow the team to pull a report with the data going forward. Keep in mind it can\u2019t work retroactively; however, it will help Pedro to report progress to you in Q3.\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\nI will work with Pedro to ensure that any changes to the attached are captured in HubSpot by EOB Friday, and I will provide you with a final report at that time.\n\u00a0\nPlease let me know if you have any questions or need additional information.\n\u00a0\nKind regards,\n\u00a0\nMelissa\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\nC.

    "body": "Hi Jennifer,\n\u00a0\nThank you for combing through the report and for your insights. Your efforts helped me to review the accuracy of the data as it is being pulled from HubSpot. The report feature I used was not entirely accurate, so I\u2019ve updated the attached report for you today and worked on troubleshooting the issue. The attached has removed any proposals in progress and Deb\u2019s pursuits that we were not involved in. Moog is The only existing client I have record of building a proposal for this quarter.\n\u00a0\nTracking proposals sent by the date is tricky for a few reasons, including that there is no HubSpot reporting feature to pull a deal status change date. Since we don\u2019t only create proposals only in HubSpot and often make proposals that other individual emails to the prospect, this information is typically tracked via email correspondence and notes, I will need to work with Pedro to create a new process that makes the data that you can pull more accurate. \n\u00a0\nOne immediate change is that I\u2019ve created multiple workflows to log the date a deal status is changed to Proposal Sent, Negotiation, and Passed to Consultant. This change will allow folks to quickly look at the left sidebar to see the dates and allow the team to pull a report with the data going forward. Keep in mind it can\u2019t work retroactively; however, it will help Pedro to report progress to you in Q3.\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\nI will work with Pedro to ensure that any changes to the attached are captured in HubSpot by EOB Friday, and I will provide you with a final report at that time.\n\u00a0\nPlease let me know if you have any questions or need additional information.\n\u00a0\nKind regards,\n\u00a0\nMelissa\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\nC.

If we exclude all of Deb\u2019s accounts with the exception of Pfizer per your note, the total number of accounts are now 32 which is less than the 34 minimum to qualify for the bonus\nI added in a column for Date Proposal Sent. There are some accounts which do not have a proposal attachment in Hubspot and I don\u2019t know when the proposal was actually sent. Please fill in the missing information so we can evaluate these accounts\nThe bonus specifically states proposals sent. I don\u2019t think we should be including the proposal in progress stage. There are 3 here on the list \n@Alisa Kolodizner\n and \n@Chuck Adams\n please weigh in here\nCommissions are based on executed SOWs so the only account eligible to be paid out commissions on is Insight.

It creates \na snapshot of the current state of the chart\n and generates a unique link which you can share with people outside your organization. This makes it easier to confirm timelines, align expectations and keep all interested parties up to date and on the same page. You can \nupdate the snapshot\n manually at any point to ensure it reflects the latest changes and developments. \nRead more\n \nReports Library\nPowerful reporting capabilities are one of the pillars of Scoro, helping you analyze various types of data so you wouldn\u2019t have to run your business on a hunch. To save you time and give you even quicker access to valuable insights, we\u2019ve now launched a \nReports Library\n. It includes shortcuts to almost 50 useful reports that help you measure and analyze the key aspects of your business \u2013 \nproductivity, utilization, revenue, cost, profitability\n and \nsales\n. Head on over to the Reports module to browse the library.

As a result of the update, you can now also assign dynamic roles, such as creator, responsible user or assignee, as notification recipients. This month we\u2019re adding another dynamic group into the mix \u2013 the \nAll users except me\n option makes it easier and faster to set up rules to notify you whenever anyone but you modifies some task, event, quote or any other relevant item. \nRead more\n \nThat's not all! \nSee our blog post for more details\n.\nWe do our very best to make Scoro better every day, so we really appreciate your feedback.

Instead a credit memo was created in 2022 which hit revenue with deposit posted to deferred revenue. \nSo overall AR balance was correct but deferred revenue and revenue was not. I corrected AR with\u00a01/1/23 JE by debiting Deferred revenue and crediting A/R.\u00a0\nHowever, this also required me to delete credit memo from Nov22 on 1/1/23 but couldn\u2019t since we couldn\u2019t change 2022 or Q1. To get things correct YTD I still need to cancel impact of credit memo but on 4/1/23.\n\u00a0\nTo cancel impact of Nov22 credit memo, \u00a0I created invoice\u00a0\n17240330 rev\n\u00a0\ndated 4/1/23 and applied Nov22 vendor credit 17240330 against this new invoice. AR aging now just shows credit of $12885 for Diligent from JE which represents credit on customer\u2019s account from duplicate payment. Nothing in deferred revenue, cash is correct and sales net zero between the two years. \n\u00a0\nIf you would prefer I can reverse the JE dated 1/1/2 on 4/1/23 but if so then deferred revenue and sales will still need corrected with another JE. Typically speaking, duplicate payments are not handled with credit memos but usually come though on deposit transactions. We can\u2019t alter the 11/1/22 deposit transaction however so a JE is the best we can do or else I have to create a fictitious deposit which I don\u2019t want to do since it involves cash. I have T accounts on this to prove my logic but unable to scan to send to you right now. \n\u00a0\nRosie\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\nFrom: \nRosie Herren <\nrosie@bookandstreet.com\n>\nDate: \nTuesday, June 20, 2023 at 2:48 PM\nTo: \nMichelle Murcia <\nm.murcia@lcwmail.com\n>, Pamela Coulter <\np.coulter@lcwmail.com\n>\nSubject: \nRe: [DKIM Failure] Diligent credit\nWe can chat when I get back from lunch on this.

I corrected AR with\u00a01/1/23 JE by debiting Deferred revenue and crediting A/R.\u00a0\nHowever, this also required me to delete credit memo from Nov22 on 1/1/23 but couldn\u2019t since we couldn\u2019t change 2022 or Q1. To get things correct YTD I still need to cancel impact of credit memo but on 4/1/23.\n\u00a0\nTo cancel impact of Nov22 credit memo, \u00a0I created invoice\u00a0\n17240330 rev\n\u00a0\ndated 4/1/23 and applied Nov22 vendor credit 17240330 against this new invoice. AR aging now just shows credit of $12885 for Diligent from JE which represents credit on customer\u2019s account from duplicate payment. Nothing in deferred revenue, cash is correct and sales net zero between the two years. \n\u00a0\nIf you would prefer I can reverse the JE dated 1/1/2 on 4/1/23 but if so then deferred revenue and sales will still need corrected with another JE. Typically speaking, duplicate payments are not handled with credit memos but usually come though on deposit transactions. We can\u2019t alter the 11/1/22 deposit transaction however so a JE is the best we can do or else I have to create a fictitious deposit which I don\u2019t want to do since it involves cash. I have T accounts on this to prove my logic but unable to scan to send to you right now. \n\u00a0\nRosie\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\nFrom: \nRosie Herren <rosie@bookandstreet.com>\nDate: \nTuesday, June 20, 2023 at 2:48 PM\nTo: \nMichelle Murcia <m.murcia@lcwmail.com>, Pamela Coulter <p.coulter@lcwmail.com>\nSubject: \nRe: [DKIM Failure] Diligent credit\nWe can chat when I get back from lunch on this.

He supported the management initiatives to develop debt restructuring options, looking initially at 20 financial company options, and honing to a more concentrated set of 6 with formal processes. This included detailed assessment of financial flow of funds using an intense spreadsheet model that included both historical results and then used a combination of predictive analytics, management judgement working with an expert executive team, and strategic plans the company had in place to chart the next few years of anticipated budget and results within the framework of optimized use of newly restructured debt models. \nHow well did Virtas meet your requirements and expectations? This was very timely and important step for the company to move to the next level of funding at that time for the business. \nHow well did Virtas remain within the original budget and timeline?\u00a0Yes. Adjustments were discussed and agreed upon as our needs changed. We were happy with the results.\nHow satisfied were you with the skill level of the Virtas team on the engagement? We would recommend this service to others needing short term consultative assistance in times of a gap or need for new expertise.\nPlease share any additional information that you think is helpful to us as we continue to review other consulting firms. \u00a0Redd is a very capable and talented expert at ABL credit lines and debt restructuring. He has built excellent networks in those bank divisions and can assist companies nicely with similar situations. \n\u00a0\nRegards,\n.\nMichael Dorfman\nCEO\nAmerican Wire Group\nP\n\u00a0954-455-3050 ext. 201\u00a0| \nM\n\u00a0305-469-4544\nE\n \nmdorfman@buyawg.com\n\u00a0| \nwww.buyawg.com\n2980 NE 207th Street Suite PH\nMiami, FL 33180 United States\n\u00a0\nFrom:\n Jennifer Barbieri <j.barbieri@lcwmail.com> \nSent:\n Thursday, June 15, 2023 1:17 PM\nTo:\n Michael Dorfman <Mdorfman@buyawg.com>\nSubject:\n Reference for Redd\n\u00a0\nYou don't often get email from \nj.barbieri@lcwmail.com\n. \nLearn why this is important\nHi Michael - thank you so much for your quick response.

I\u2019ve also included all of Beth\u2019s notes below that.\n\u00a0\nHere are my consolidated thoughts and tentative first-impressions stack-rank:\nTim Czmiel & Redding (\"Redd\") Thomas (Virtas Partners Rate Card attached) --> Know their stuff; we would be super small for them; not sure who we would get (they have 43 employees); made some comments that they might be able to make some introductions \nScott Moran --> Good if considering CFO / CCO pieces as well; would be a well-oiled machine; could be more integrated; would need to look at pricing\nKevin Kelly --> Independent and would do 80% of the work himself; fit would really matter so Alisa should screen\nRecommended next steps:\nGet pricing schedule from each\nMeet with referrals of each (I am not able to do this timely; someone else will need to)\nAlisa to meet with Kevin to determine fit\nCompare pricing and benefits\nReferences\n\u00a0\nTim Czmiel References\nMartin Carroll, Chairman of Fox Swibel law firm in Chicago.\u00a0 His email is \nmcarroll@foxswibel.com\n and his phone number is 312-224-1230. \nAlex Parrish of Honigman.\u00a0 Alex is head corporate attorney for his law firm and has a national practice.\u00a0 His phone number is 313-465-7512 and his e-mail is \naparrish@honigman.com\n. \n\u00a0\nKevin Kelly References attached.\nReferences for Matthew Brash (Guy Alisa met with)\nLeslie H \u2013 414-241-7699\nTom T \u2013 224-330-7889\nTerrell \u2013 303-638-6413\n\u00a0\nFrom Beth:\nBelow are my notes and thoughts from today's \"\nWintrust Recommendation: Scott Moran & LCW\"\n meeting with Scott Moran.\u00a0 FYI, his contact information is as follows:\u00a0 (815) 404-3811; \nsmoran@sutkermoran.com\n; \nwww.sutkermoran.com\n.\n\u00a0\nOVERALL:\u00a0 Strong consider; price-dependent\n\u00a0\nIMPRESSION:\nReasonable; liked approach and philosophy.\u00a0 This is likely not the person that you would work with, so hard to say with who you would work with.\nNOTES / OBSERVATIONS:\nWork with profitable and distressed businesses; can be hands on or hands off.\u00a0 Commonality is needs more labor for their firm.\nCan play a permanent CFO or CCO role in a company as well (do this for over 50 companies)\n#1 is have discussions with leadership with goal to get to know the business and nuances of the business early.\u00a0 Seek to understand the culture.\n#2 is understanding the forecast that we have in place; focus on that first.\u00a0 Putting the projection together and verifying assumptions and mapping it out.\n#3 from there, we have articulated the plan, communicated with the bank, will need to monitor.\u00a0 What changes are we making, from there what does that projection tell us and what do you need and how can we help?\u00a0 Sometimes there is not additional resources needed, some just need help laying it out and that is it.\u00a0 Then they can help communicate with the bank.\u00a0 \nNote:\u00a0 \"we work for you guys, not the bank.\"\u00a0 They just introduced us. \nRevenue --> growing and diversifying their revenue.\u00a0 Most of those permanent engagement...can be CFO and / or CCO.\u00a0 As examples, in service and construction (50% of customers); project based environment with a fixed labor pool.\u00a0 Understanding the backlog and matching that up and right-sizing personnel is important. \nChallenging and working with the leadership to come up with ideas and working with them to come up with ideas.\u00a0 See what is working and not working and amplifying that.\u00a0 \nInterim or permanent CFO roles that they can fill --> \"roll up our sleeves type firm, not a PPT firm.\"\u00a0 Permanent or interim CFO and CCO options.\u00a0 Statardize close, forecast, projections, etc. Training firm members and deploying to the companies they work with.\u00a0 They can do that on a fixed-fee basis (agree on tasks and guaranteed for a fixed fee).\u00a0 \nRetention rates / ability to speak to current services customer --> Can speak to current customers.\u00a0 They will include fees and references in his follow-ups.\u00a0 Consider for multiple seats (at least in the interim).\nBelow are my notes and thoughts from today's \"\nWintrust Recommendation: Kevin Kelly & LCW\n\" meeting.\n\u00a0\nOVERALL:\u00a0 Could be good; more flexible and more willing to be piecemeal and willing to consider different scopes.\u00a0 The first between management and Kevin will be very important, so that should be sussed out before going further.\u00a0 Can help with CFO / CCO quality, but does not supplement those roles in the way the prior firm can.\n\u00a0\nIMPRESSION:\nOwns his own firm; does 80%+ of the work himself (have to really like him)\nWilling to cater to us and what we need\nAligned to the business\nCharge by the hour and can be efficient (can help with scope and good with estimation); can tell with a range on where we might end up\n$350 / hour\nNOTES / OBSERVATIONS\nBackground.\u00a0 Chicago native.\u00a0 Went into public accounting.\u00a0 Was a partner.\u00a0 [Went on tangents].\u00a0 Worked in management consulting.\u00a0 Been out on their own since 2019.\u00a0 Has two individuals, but 80%+ of the work he does himself.\u00a0 \nMiddle market focus; small to incredibly large.\u00a0 Lots of experience.\u00a0 Worked with 450+ closely held companies.\u00a0 Implement best practices and strategic planning.\u00a0 Operationalize, professionalize, streamline, etc.\u00a0 Accounting background drives him to focus on profitability.\u00a0 \n\"Always' creates more value than his fee.\u00a0 Work for the business, directed by the company.\u00a0 Fiduciary duty would be to the ownership of LCW.\u00a0 \nKeep liquidity.\u00a0 Have worked with every lending institution across everything (investment banking background).\u00a0 Have been lucky and good and tend to get referred (2/3 bank) and (1/3 board members / CEOs).\u00a0 If you have liquidity; first goal is to get to profitability.\u00a0 The covenants can be rest.\u00a0 Two different opposing forces.\u00a0 The originators vs the credit group that is paid to worry; helping them understand the plan so they can be placated.\nOn growing revenue.\u00a0 Been in consulting 37+ years of his life.\u00a0 Have worked with companies tangentially in this space (HR consulting, etc.).\u00a0 The spend in this area can be the first go go; there is a process by which I would understand and challenge the current business development and marketing goals (strategy, lead time, pipeline, are we measuring that performance, etc.)\u00a0 This is talking about process improvement for revenue, versus helping in business development (generally expected for this space).\u00a0 \nGetting to business development and how doing targeting marketing.\u00a0 Is there a finder's fee.\nSuperpowers --> business practices that they have implemented and successfully brought online at companies (100s of times and in growth and distressed); the experience on navigating the gamut is his secret superpower (aka, seen it all ; deep experience).\u00a0 There is a concern about our numbers.\u00a0 That skillset is easy for him to come in and understand.\nWork well with people.\u00a0 Understanding the environment and recommend things that are able to be implemented.\u00a0 Bank thinks highly of the business and Alisa.\u00a0 Hasn't been a good articulation of the plan or they have not believed it.\nNeeds:\u00a0 timely information; access to the right people in a timely way; opportunity to build consensus; candor; be thoughtful on how we explain their role to the rest of the team\nWilling to do piecemeal and take work that the team has done (and that he vets). \nBelow are my notes and thoughts from today's \"\nTony Wilkins Recommendation: Tim Czmiel & LCW\n\" meeting.\n\u00a0\nOVERALL:\u00a0 I liked them; very knowledgeable and had the relationships needed.\u00a0 Need to determine if we can actually afford them (we are small for them).\n\u00a0\nIMPRESSION:\nSeem to be very experienced.\u00a0 Seemed to be slightly condescending, but would ask you to stress test that yourself.\u00a0 Have experience in the area.\u00a0 Unclear on their alignment to business versus the bank.\nNOTES / OBSERVATIONS:\nThey know the bank and the people there\nTwo people\n(1) would need to request a waiver of the covenant and will want a tight look on cash flows and projections\nSuperpower:\u00a0 where we shine is they know us, we come in and everyone takes a deep breath and gives us a chance to take a look and give some reassurance that nothing is on fire and not hidden time bombs and then we shine in terms of running projections and cash flows (waivers; restructuring; taking them out and bringing someone else in)\n(2) help with decreasing expenses and increasing revenue; this is their \"bread and butter\"; everything mentioned is routine.\u00a0 A bit more difficult than realize to get the covenant waiver; need the cash flow model(rolling) and then a cadence with the loan officer with some company representative.\u00a0 Give them the overview of what time is needed to put together financial statements and rationalize the business (\"one of the biggest mistakes people make is to get out the hatchet too early\nLCW is on the very, very low side of what they do (as in super small compared to what they do).\u00a0 Banks require independent third parties to do this work.\u00a0 Lost confidence in the CFO; they would no longer be the point person with dealing with the bank (That would be Redd).\u00a0 Goal to get to real data and real information.\nWorked with over 100 operating companies.\u00a0 \nBuild trust between the company and the lending institution.\u00a0 Depending on the severity of the situation, they don't just give a covenant waiver...they will need to see a tactical plan (not a strategic plan)...accounting, finance, sales, and operations...what are you going to do in each?\nHelps that they know Wintrust.\u00a0 Get us a chance to get to know numbers and the management and then report back.\u00a0 Establish credibility.\u00a0 \nWill send a rate sheet (might have to revise a bit because we are so small).\u00a0 Will share referrals.\u00a0 \nTim --> can't tell you how many times over the years I have gotten a call \"small town USA\" there have been so many...why?\u00a0 To see these individuals; save jobs is Tim's motivation.\u00a0 Giving hope and saving jobs.\u00a0 \nRedd --. I have a hero complex.\u00a0 I love to come in a challenging situation that is rigorous and coming out on top.\u00a0 We have never not succeeded.\u00a0 \nCompany of 43 people; unclear who we would be working with.\u00a0 We know consulting and know how to build a business.\u00a0 Has no debt and designed that way.\u00a0 Question on if we are too small for them.\nFirst is stabilization and getting things calmed down.\u00a0 Lenders would love to see 3 years of projections.\u00a0 They want to see what you are going to do, sensitivity analysis, do they want to stick with you or not.\u00a0 Needs a growth plan.\u00a0 need to be in alignment with the financial projection.\nNeeds to be a meeting after a RIF (reduction in force) to have a script, this is what happened, why, etc.\nBankers will want a variance report with a rolling 13 week model.\u00a0 \n\u00a0\nBriza Cardenas\n(she/her/hers)\nChief of Staff, Office of the CEO\nEmail: \nb.cardenas@lcwmail.com\nPhone: 773-938-3767 (CST)\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\nwww\n\u00a0\n|\n\u00a0\nTwitter\n \n|\n\u00a0\nFacebook\n\u00a0\n|\n\u00a0\nLinkedIn\n\u00a0\nTo inspire kindness, deepen\u00a0understanding, and foster equity in\u00a0the communities\u00a0where people live\u00a0and at the organizations where they\u00a0work.\n\u00a0\nFrom:\n Beth Sabin <\nsabin.beth@gmail.com\n> \nSent:\n Monday, June 5, 2023 7:18 PM\nTo:\n Alisa Kolodizner <\na.kolodizner@lcwmail.com\n>; Briza Cardenas <\nb.cardenas@lcwmail.com\n>\nSubject:\n Fwd: Stack Ranking\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n---------- Forwarded message ---------\nFrom: \nBeth Sabin\n <\nsabin.beth@gmail.com\n>\nDate: Fri, Jun 2, 2023 at 6:51\u202fPM\nSubject: Stack Ranking\nTo: Alisa Kolodizner <\na.kolodizner@lcwmail.com\n>\n\u00a0\nHi Alisa,\n\u00a0\nHere are my consolidated thoughts and tentative first-impressions stack-rank:\nTim Czmiel & Redding (\"Redd\") Thomas --> Know their stuff; we would be super small for them; not sure who we would get (they have 43 employees); made some comments that they might be able to make some introductions \nScott Moran --> Good if considering CFO / CCO pieces as well; would be a well-oiled machine; could be more integrated; would need to look at pricing\nKevin Kelly --> Independent and would do 80% of the work himself; fit would really matter so Alisa should screen\nRecommended next steps:\nGet pricing schedule from each\nMeet with referrals of each (I am not able to do this timely; someone else will need to)\nAlisa to meet with Kevin to determine fit\nCompare pricing and benefits\nBest,\nBeth",

can be hands on or hands off.\u00a0 Commonality is needs more labor for their firm.\nCan play a permanent CFO or CCO role in a company as well (do this for over 50 companies)\n#1 is have discussions with leadership with goal to get to know the business and nuances of the business early.\u00a0 Seek to understand the culture.\n#2 is understanding the forecast that we have in place; focus on that first.\u00a0 Putting the projection together and verifying assumptions and mapping it out.\n#3 from there, we have articulated the plan, communicated with the bank, will need to monitor.\u00a0 What changes are we making, from there what does that projection tell us and what do you need and how can we help?\u00a0 Sometimes there is not additional resources needed, some just need help laying it out and that is it.\u00a0 Then they can help communicate with the bank.\u00a0 \nNote:\u00a0 \"we work for you guys, not the bank.\"\u00a0 They just introduced us. \nRevenue --> growing and diversifying their revenue.\u00a0 Most of those permanent engagement...can be CFO and / or CCO.\u00a0 As examples, in service and construction (50% of customers); project based environment with a fixed labor pool.\u00a0 Understanding the backlog and matching that up and right-sizing personnel is important. \nChallenging and working with the leadership to come up with ideas and working with them to come up with ideas.\u00a0 See what is working and not working and amplifying that.\u00a0 \nInterim or permanent CFO roles that they can fill --> \"roll up our sleeves type firm, not a PPT firm.\"\u00a0 Permanent or interim CFO and CCO options.\u00a0 Statardize close, forecast, projections, etc. Training firm members and deploying to the companies they work with.\u00a0 They can do that on a fixed-fee basis (agree on tasks and guaranteed for a fixed fee).\u00a0 \nRetention rates / ability to speak to current services customer --> Can speak to current customers.\u00a0 They will include fees and references in his follow-ups.\u00a0 Consider for multiple seats (at least in the interim).\nBelow are my notes and thoughts from today's \"\nWintrust Recommendation: Kevin Kelly & LCW\n\" meeting.\n\u00a0\nOVERALL:\u00a0 Could be good; more flexible and more willing to be piecemeal and willing to consider different scopes.\u00a0 The first between management and Kevin will be very important, so that should be sussed out before going further.\u00a0 Can help with CFO / CCO quality, but does not supplement those roles in the way the prior firm can.\n\u00a0\nIMPRESSION:\nOwns his own firm; does 80%+ of the work himself (have to really like him)\nWilling to cater to us and what we need\nAligned to the business\nCharge by the hour and can be efficient (can help with scope and good with estimation); can tell with a range on where we might end up\n$350 / hour\nNOTES / OBSERVATIONS\nBackground.\u00a0 Chicago native.\u00a0 Went into public accounting.\u00a0 Was a partner.\u00a0 [Went on tangents].\u00a0 Worked in management consulting.\u00a0 Been out on their own since 2019.\u00a0 Has two individuals, but 80%+ of the work he does himself.\u00a0 \nMiddle market focus; small to incredibly large.\u00a0 Lots of experience.\u00a0 Worked with 450+ closely held companies.\u00a0 Implement best practices and strategic planning.\u00a0 Operationalize, professionalize, streamline, etc.\u00a0 Accounting background drives him to focus on profitability.\u00a0 \n\"Always' creates more value than his fee.\u00a0 Work for the business, directed by the company.\u00a0 Fiduciary duty would be to the ownership of LCW.\u00a0 \nKeep liquidity.\u00a0 Have worked with every lending institution across everything (investment banking background).\u00a0 Have been lucky and good and tend to get referred (2/3 bank) and (1/3 board members / CEOs).\u00a0 If you have liquidity; first goal is to get to profitability.\u00a0 The covenants can be rest.\u00a0 Two different opposing forces.\u00a0 The originators vs the credit group that is paid to worry; helping them understand the plan so they can be placated.\nOn growing revenue.\u00a0 Been in consulting 37+ years of his life.\u00a0 Have worked with companies tangentially in this space (HR consulting, etc.).\u00a0 The spend in this area can be the first go go; there is a process by which I would understand and challenge the current business development and marketing goals (strategy, lead time, pipeline, are we measuring that performance, etc.)\u00a0 This is talking about process improvement for revenue, versus helping in business development (generally expected for this space).\u00a0 \nGetting to business development and how doing targeting marketing.\u00a0 Is there a finder's fee.\nSuperpowers --> business practices that they have implemented and successfully brought online at companies (100s of times and in growth and distressed); the experience on navigating the gamut is his secret superpower (aka, seen it all ; deep experience).\u00a0 There is a concern about our numbers.\u00a0 That skillset is easy for him to come in and understand.\nWork well with people.\u00a0 Understanding the environment and recommend things that are able to be implemented.\u00a0 Bank thinks highly of the business and Alisa.\u00a0 Hasn't been a good articulation of the plan or they have not believed it.\nNeeds:\u00a0 timely information; access to the right people in a timely way; opportunity to build consensus; candor; be thoughtful on how we explain their role to the rest of the team\nWilling to do piecemeal and take work that the team has done (and that he vets). \nBelow are my notes and thoughts from today's \"\nTony Wilkins Recommendation: Tim Czmiel & LCW\n\" meeting.\n\u00a0\nOVERALL:\u00a0 I liked them; very knowledgeable and had the relationships needed.\u00a0 Need to determine if we can actually afford them (we are small for them).\n\u00a0\nIMPRESSION:\nSeem to be very experienced.\u00a0 Seemed to be slightly condescending, but would ask you to stress test that yourself.\u00a0 Have experience in the area.\u00a0 Unclear on their alignment to business versus the bank.\nNOTES / OBSERVATIONS:\nThey know the bank and the people there\nTwo people\n(1) would need to request a waiver of the covenant and will want a tight look on cash flows and projections\nSuperpower:\u00a0 where we shine is they know us, we come in and everyone takes a deep breath and gives us a chance to take a look and give some reassurance that nothing is on fire and not hidden time bombs and then we shine in terms of running projections and cash flows (waivers; restructuring; taking them out and bringing someone else in)\n(2) help with decreasing expenses and increasing revenue; this is their \"bread and butter\"; everything mentioned is routine.\u00a0 A bit more difficult than realize to get the covenant waiver; need the cash flow model(rolling) and then a cadence with the loan officer with some company representative.\u00a0 Give them the overview of what time is needed to put together financial statements and rationalize the business (\"one of the biggest mistakes people make is to get out the hatchet too early\nLCW is on the very, very low side of what they do (as in super small compared to what they do).\u00a0 Banks require independent third parties to do this work.\u00a0 Lost confidence in the CFO; they would no longer be the point person with dealing with the bank (That would be Redd).\u00a0 Goal to get to real data and real information.\nWorked with over 100 operating companies.\u00a0 \nBuild trust between the company and the lending institution.\u00a0 Depending on the severity of the situation, they don't just give a covenant waiver...they will need to see a tactical plan (not a strategic plan)...accounting, finance, sales, and operations...what are you going to do in each?\nHelps that they know Wintrust.\u00a0 Get us a chance to get to know numbers and the management and then report back.\u00a0 Establish credibility.\u00a0 \nWill send a rate sheet (might have to revise a bit because we are so small).\u00a0 Will share referrals.\u00a0 \nTim --> can't tell you how many times over the years I have gotten a call \"small town USA\" there have been so many...why?\u00a0 To see these individuals; save jobs is Tim's motivation.\u00a0 Giving hope and saving jobs.\u00a0 \nRedd --. I have a hero complex.\u00a0 I love to come in a challenging situation that is rigorous and coming out on top.\u00a0 We have never not succeeded.\u00a0 \nCompany of 43 people; unclear who we would be working with.\u00a0 We know consulting and know how to build a business.\u00a0 Has no debt and designed that way.\u00a0 Question on if we are too small for them.\nFirst is stabilization and getting things calmed down.\u00a0 Lenders would love to see 3 years of projections.\u00a0 They want to see what you are going to do, sensitivity analysis, do they want to stick with you or not.\u00a0 Needs a growth plan.\u00a0 need to be in alignment with the financial projection.\nNeeds to be a meeting after a RIF (reduction in force) to have a script, this is what happened, why, etc.\nBankers will want a variance report with a rolling 13 week model.\u00a0 \n\u00a0\nBriza Cardenas\n(she/her/hers)\nChief of Staff, Office of the CEO\nEmail: \nb.cardenas@lcwmail.com\nPhone: 773-938-3767 (CST)\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\nwww\n\u00a0\n|\n\u00a0\nTwitter\n \n|\n\u00a0\nFacebook\n\u00a0\n|\n\u00a0\nLinkedIn\n\u00a0\nTo inspire kindness, deepen\u00a0understanding, and foster equity in\u00a0the communities\u00a0where people live\u00a0and at the organizations where they\u00a0work.\n\u00a0\nFrom:\n Beth Sabin <\nsabin.beth@gmail.com\n> \nSent:\n Monday, June 5, 2023 7:18 PM\nTo:\n Alisa Kolodizner <\na.kolodizner@lcwmail.com\n>; Briza Cardenas <\nb.cardenas@lcwmail.com\n>\nSubject:\n Fwd: Stack Ranking\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n---------- Forwarded message ---------\nFrom: \nBeth Sabin\n <\nsabin.beth@gmail.com\n>\nDate: Fri, Jun 2, 2023 at 6:51\u202fPM\nSubject: Stack Ranking\nTo: Alisa Kolodizner <\na.kolodizner@lcwmail.com\n>\n\u00a0\nHi Alisa,\n\u00a0\nHere are my consolidated thoughts and tentative first-impressions stack-rank:\nTim Czmiel & Redding (\"Redd\") Thomas --> Know their stuff; we would be super small for them; not sure who we would get (they have 43 employees); made some comments that they might be able to make some introductions \nScott Moran --> Good if considering CFO / CCO pieces as well; would be a well-oiled machine; could be more integrated; would need to look at pricing\nKevin Kelly --> Independent and would do 80% of the work himself; fit would really matter so Alisa should screen\nRecommended next steps:\nGet pricing schedule from each\nMeet with referrals of each (I am not able to do this timely; someone else will need to)\nAlisa to meet with Kevin to determine fit\nCompare pricing and benefits\nBest,\nBeth",

focus on that first.\u00a0 Putting the projection together and verifying assumptions and mapping it out.\n#3 from there, we have articulated the plan, communicated with the bank, will need to monitor.\u00a0 What changes are we making, from there what does that projection tell us and what do you need and how can we help?\u00a0 Sometimes there is not additional resources needed, some just need help laying it out and that is it.\u00a0 Then they can help communicate with the bank.\u00a0 \nNote:\u00a0 \"we work for you guys, not the bank.\"\u00a0 They just introduced us. \nRevenue --> growing and diversifying their revenue.\u00a0 Most of those permanent engagement...can be CFO and / or CCO.\u00a0 As examples, in service and construction (50% of customers); project based environment with a fixed labor pool.\u00a0 Understanding the backlog and matching that up and right-sizing personnel is important. \nChallenging and working with the leadership to come up with ideas and working with them to come up with ideas.\u00a0 See what is working and not working and amplifying that.\u00a0 \nInterim or permanent CFO roles that they can fill --> \"roll up our sleeves type firm, not a PPT firm.\"\u00a0 Permanent or interim CFO and CCO options.\u00a0 Statardize close, forecast, projections, etc. Training firm members and deploying to the companies they work with.\u00a0 They can do that on a fixed-fee basis (agree on tasks and guaranteed for a fixed fee).\u00a0 \nRetention rates / ability to speak to current services customer --> Can speak to current customers.\u00a0 They will include fees and references in his follow-ups.\u00a0 Consider for multiple seats (at least in the interim).\nBelow are my notes and thoughts from today's \"\nWintrust Recommendation: Kevin Kelly & LCW\n\" meeting.\n\u00a0\nOVERALL:\u00a0 Could be good; more flexible and more willing to be piecemeal and willing to consider different scopes.\u00a0 The first between management and Kevin will be very important, so that should be sussed out before going further.\u00a0 Can help with CFO / CCO quality, but does not supplement those roles in the way the prior firm can.\n\u00a0\nIMPRESSION:\nOwns his own firm; does 80%+ of the work himself (have to really like him)\nWilling to cater to us and what we need\nAligned to the business\nCharge by the hour and can be efficient (can help with scope and good with estimation); can tell with a range on where we might end up\n$350 / hour\nNOTES / OBSERVATIONS\nBackground.\u00a0 Chicago native.\u00a0 Went into public accounting.\u00a0 Was a partner.\u00a0 [Went on tangents].\u00a0 Worked in management consulting.\u00a0 Been out on their own since 2019.\u00a0 Has two individuals, but 80%+ of the work he does himself.\u00a0 \nMiddle market focus; small to incredibly large.\u00a0 Lots of experience.\u00a0 Worked with 450+ closely held companies.\u00a0 Implement best practices and strategic planning.\u00a0 Operationalize, professionalize, streamline, etc.\u00a0 Accounting background drives him to focus on profitability.\u00a0 \n\"Always' creates more value than his fee.\u00a0 Work for the business, directed by the company.\u00a0 Fiduciary duty would be to the ownership of LCW.\u00a0 \nKeep liquidity.\u00a0 Have worked with every lending institution across everything (investment banking background).\u00a0 Have been lucky and good and tend to get referred (2/3 bank) and (1/3 board members / CEOs).\u00a0 If you have liquidity; first goal is to get to profitability.\u00a0 The covenants can be rest.\u00a0 Two different opposing forces.\u00a0 The originators vs the credit group that is paid to worry; helping them understand the plan so they can be placated.\nOn growing revenue.\u00a0 Been in consulting 37+ years of his life.\u00a0 Have worked with companies tangentially in this space (HR consulting, etc.).\u00a0 The spend in this area can be the first go go; there is a process by which I would understand and challenge the current business development and marketing goals (strategy, lead time, pipeline, are we measuring that performance, etc.)\u00a0 This is talking about process improvement for revenue, versus helping in business development (generally expected for this space).\u00a0 \nGetting to business development and how doing targeting marketing.\u00a0 Is there a finder's fee.\nSuperpowers --> business practices that they have implemented and successfully brought online at companies (100s of times and in growth and distressed); the experience on navigating the gamut is his secret superpower (aka, seen it all ; deep experience).\u00a0 There is a concern about our numbers.\u00a0 That skillset is easy for him to come in and understand.\nWork well with people.\u00a0 Understanding the environment and recommend things that are able to be implemented.\u00a0 Bank thinks highly of the business and Alisa.\u00a0 Hasn't been a good articulation of the plan or they have not believed it.\nNeeds:\u00a0 timely information; access to the right people in a timely way; opportunity to build consensus; candor; be thoughtful on how we explain their role to the rest of the team\nWilling to do piecemeal and take work that the team has done (and that he vets). \nBelow are my notes and thoughts from today's \"\nTony Wilkins Recommendation: Tim Czmiel & LCW\n\" meeting.\n\u00a0\nOVERALL:\u00a0 I liked them; very knowledgeable and had the relationships needed.\u00a0 Need to determine if we can actually afford them (we are small for them).\n\u00a0\nIMPRESSION:\nSeem to be very experienced.\u00a0 Seemed to be slightly condescending, but would ask you to stress test that yourself.\u00a0 Have experience in the area.\u00a0 Unclear on their alignment to business versus the bank.\nNOTES / OBSERVATIONS:\nThey know the bank and the people there\nTwo people\n(1) would need to request a waiver of the covenant and will want a tight look on cash flows and projections\nSuperpower:\u00a0 where we shine is they know us, we come in and everyone takes a deep breath and gives us a chance to take a look and give some reassurance that nothing is on fire and not hidden time bombs and then we shine in terms of running projections and cash flows (waivers; restructuring; taking them out and bringing someone else in)\n(2) help with decreasing expenses and increasing revenue; this is their \"bread and butter\"; everything mentioned is routine.\u00a0 A bit more difficult than realize to get the covenant waiver; need the cash flow model(rolling) and then a cadence with the loan officer with some company representative.\u00a0 Give them the overview of what time is needed to put together financial statements and rationalize the business (\"one of the biggest mistakes people make is to get out the hatchet too early\nLCW is on the very, very low side of what they do (as in super small compared to what they do).\u00a0 Banks require independent third parties to do this work.\u00a0 Lost confidence in the CFO; they would no longer be the point person with dealing with the bank (That would be Redd).\u00a0 Goal to get to real data and real information.\nWorked with over 100 operating companies.\u00a0 \nBuild trust between the company and the lending institution.\u00a0 Depending on the severity of the situation, they don't just give a covenant waiver...they will need to see a tactical plan (not a strategic plan)...accounting, finance, sales, and operations...what are you going to do in each?\nHelps that they know Wintrust.\u00a0 Get us a chance to get to know numbers and the management and then report back.\u00a0 Establish credibility.\u00a0 \nWill send a rate sheet (might have to revise a bit because we are so small).\u00a0 Will share referrals.\u00a0 \nTim --> can't tell you how many times over the years I have gotten a call \"small town USA\" there have been so many...why?\u00a0 To see these individuals; save jobs is Tim's motivation.\u00a0 Giving hope and saving jobs.\u00a0 \nRedd --. I have a hero complex.\u00a0 I love to come in a challenging situation that is rigorous and coming out on top.\u00a0 We have never not succeeded.\u00a0 \nCompany of 43 people; unclear who we would be working with.\u00a0 We know consulting and know how to build a business.\u00a0 Has no debt and designed that way.\u00a0 Question on if we are too small for them.\nFirst is stabilization and getting things calmed down.\u00a0 Lenders would love to see 3 years of projections.\u00a0 They want to see what you are going to do, sensitivity analysis, do they want to stick with you or not.\u00a0 Needs a growth plan.\u00a0 need to be in alignment with the financial projection.\nNeeds to be a meeting after a RIF (reduction in force) to have a script, this is what happened, why, etc.\nBankers will want a variance report with a rolling 13 week model.\u00a0 \n\u00a0\nBriza Cardenas\n(she/her/hers)\nChief of Staff, Office of the CEO\nEmail: \nb.cardenas@lcwmail.com\nPhone: 773-938-3767 (CST)\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\nwww\n\u00a0\n|\n\u00a0\nTwitter\n \n|\n\u00a0\nFacebook\n\u00a0\n|\n\u00a0\nLinkedIn\n\u00a0\nTo inspire kindness, deepen\u00a0understanding, and foster equity in\u00a0the communities\u00a0where people live\u00a0and at the organizations where they\u00a0work.\n\u00a0\nFrom:\n Beth Sabin <\nsabin.beth@gmail.com\n> \nSent:\n Monday, June 5, 2023 7:18 PM\nTo:\n Alisa Kolodizner <\na.kolodizner@lcwmail.com\n>; Briza Cardenas <\nb.cardenas@lcwmail.com\n>\nSubject:\n Fwd: Stack Ranking\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n---------- Forwarded message ---------\nFrom: \nBeth Sabin\n <\nsabin.beth@gmail.com\n>\nDate: Fri, Jun 2, 2023 at 6:51\u202fPM\nSubject: Stack Ranking\nTo: Alisa Kolodizner <\na.kolodizner@lcwmail.com\n>\n\u00a0\nHi Alisa,\n\u00a0\nHere are my consolidated thoughts and tentative first-impressions stack-rank:\nTim Czmiel & Redding (\"Redd\") Thomas --> Know their stuff; we would be super small for them; not sure who we would get (they have 43 employees); made some comments that they might be able to make some introductions \nScott Moran --> Good if considering CFO / CCO pieces as well; would be a well-oiled machine; could be more integrated; would need to look at pricing\nKevin Kelly --> Independent and would do 80% of the work himself; fit would really matter so Alisa should screen\nRecommended next steps:\nGet pricing schedule from each\nMeet with referrals of each (I am not able to do this timely; someone else will need to)\nAlisa to meet with Kevin to determine fit\nCompare pricing and benefits\nBest,\nBeth",
