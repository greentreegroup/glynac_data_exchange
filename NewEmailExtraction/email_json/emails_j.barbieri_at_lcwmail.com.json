    "body": "Hi,\nReconciliation runs are part of a payroll provider's normal quarter's-end reconciliation process. Zenefits Payroll is running those corrections to ensure you pay the correct amount to each tax jurisdiction where you're liable for payroll taxes.\nWhen we do reconciliations, we look for variances between what we collected in taxes from your pay runs in the quarter and what the tax agencies expect you to pay. In some cases, we'll find variances between these two amounts. Variances are normal, and can be the result of a number of things.\nHere's a snapshot of where you stand, and what will happen next:\nFor your Full-Service jurisdictions, we will automatically create pay runs in your account and you'll see the following net amount \ncredited to \nyour bank account ending in ******6303 by April 07, 2023 for $0.04 for Unemployment Tax.\nFor additional details, please feel free to review your \nAll In One report\n from your Payroll app.\nThanks, \nZenefits \nQuestions or concerns?
