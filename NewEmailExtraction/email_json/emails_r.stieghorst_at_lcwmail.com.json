Bensley Distinguished Service Professor of Organismal Biology and Anatomy, \nTiktaalik\n remains key to understanding the evolutionary transition between aquatic and terrestrial life. \n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\nNatural selections\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n1\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\nArmed and dangerous: New research found that octopus arms are controlled by a \nsegmented nervous system\n, allowing independent movement of each individual sucker and extremely fine motor control for grasping, exploring, and hunting. \n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n2\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\nHotter, drier, spongier: A fungus that curbs invasive spongy moth populations is \npredicted to decline\n\u2014leading to more and more tree damage\u2014due to the hotter, drier conditions brought on by climate change, according to computer models of species interaction.\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n3\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\nSink or swim: The \ndebate over \nSpinosaurus\n\u2019s hunting style continues\n as new studies clash on whether the sail-backed dinosaur\u2019s dense bones enabled it to dive deep for its food or if the species was too buoyant to fully submerge.\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\nSpotlight\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\nBless the rains\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n \n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\nA new study suggests rainwater could have helped protocells develop their cell walls 3.8 billion years ago, a critical step in the evolutionary transition from RNA molecules to living organisms.

Scientists have long believed these droplets were the starting point for early cellular life, but the theory had a vexing problem: Under evolutionary conditions, the droplets exchange RNA so quickly that the process would have resulted in identical clones\u2014not in the genetic mutations needed for evolutionary change. A new study from the University of Chicago and the University of Houston exposed these naturally occurring droplets to rainwater, which helped form a protective \u201cbarrier\u201d around the molecules and slowed RNA exchange. This breakthrough addresses a major challenge in origin-of-life research by demonstrating how early protocells could have maintained genetic differences, fostering natural selection. \n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\nIn case you missed it\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n \n\u00a0\nAt the heart of it:\n \nAmerican Heart Month observed\u2014a look at the latest in cardiovascular research.\n \n\u00a0\n \n\u00a0\nOn the map:\n \nMolecular \u201cmapping\u201d uses powerful next-generation microscopes to create diagrams of cells, genes, and even entire organs to better understand how they work within the body.\n \n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\nSupport biological sciences at UChicago.\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\nSign up\n to receive \n\u00b5Chicago\n monthly.\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\nBiological Sciences Division\nPritzker School of Molecular Engineering\nMore science at UChicago News\nMore science at UChicago Magazine\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n \n\u00a0\nThe University of Chicago \n5801 South Ellis Avenue, Chicago, IL 60637 \n1.800.955.0065\n\u00a0\n \nThis \u03bcChicago email was sent to randall@lcwmail.com.\nIf you no longer wish to receive these emails, you may \nupdate your communication preferences\n at any time.",

    "body": "Musings and Meditations on Mindfulness\n \n \nMarch 2025\nWelcome to Issue No. 13 of MindTaming!\n\u200a\n \n \nOn My Mind:\n \nStaying Calm in the Turmoil\n \n\u201cWe don\u2019t have the luxury of despair.\u201d \u2013 U.S. Senator Jon Ossoff\nDear Friends,\nThis issue of \u201cMindTaming\u201d marks the beginning of year 4 of this blog focused on mindfulness practices, tools and resources. It seems that this type of practice is helpful to more and more people all around me. The mailing list for my Wednesday meditation group is growing every week. (For more information about this group and how to join, see the Community section below.)\nMeditation and mindfulness practices are one way to keep ourselves centered and grounded amid the chaos, uncertainty and constant change all around us, no matter where we stand politically. There are many other ways. We just can\u2019t give up \u2013 or in.\u00a0\nMaintaining a positive inner state, growing our resiliency, staying calm, getting rest and relying on our resources are all things we must do right now. Why? So that we can be our best selves, offer calm and peace to others and take action that aligns with our values and circumstances. As a white, well-educated, middle-class female, I can do a lot of things IF I take care of myself and my loved ones.\u00a0\u00a0\nWhen so many things around me seem out of my control, it\u2019s useful to focus on what I CAN control. My inner state and my physical well-being are things I do have control over. And they impact the way I show up in the world and the kind of behaviors I display.\u00a0\u00a0\nHere are a few things I have found helpful in these trying times:\nKeep things simple and don\u2019t aim for perfection\n. \nNot meeting every single deadline is ok \u2013 just let people know you\u2019re going to be late.\u00a0\n \nRealize that things take time\n. \nDon\u2019t expect immediate results and settle in for the long haul.\n \nDon\u2019t give up hope\n. \n\u201cHope is a discipline, a practice and a commitment,\u201d says American educator and activist Mariame Kaba. Follow her advice.\n \nPractice the 4 Cs\n. \nCommunity, Compassion, Curiosity and Courage.\u00a0\n \nHave fun and do joyful things\n. \n\u201cJoy is an act of resistance,\u201d declares poet Toy Derricotte in her poem \u201cThe Telly Cycle.\u201d\n \nFinally, be gentle with yourself. Try things out and experiment. Reverse course if something is not working. Most of all, remember what really matters to you \u2013 and trust your inner voice.\u00a0\nHow are you going to bring joy into your life in the coming months? I am exploring the heel of the Italian peninsula (Puglia) on a bicycle in April before participating in the final AIDS Vaccine charity bike ride near Atlanta in May. I hope both activities will help me stay centered and strong for the challenges ahead of us.\nWishing you a beautiful spring,\nRita\n \n \nTaming:\n \nCultivating Your Practice\n \nGet physical. Do something new with your hands.\nWhen I get nervous or worried or when I am looking for distraction, I find it helpful to do something with my hands. By using my body in this way and engaging a different part of my brain, I tend to feel more grounded and centered. There are many ways to \u201cget physical\u201d (in addition to exercising, cleaning, cooking, gardening, etc.).\u00a0\u00a0For instance:\nKnitting, crocheting, needlepoint or other kinds of crafts\n. I recently found a great \u201ccrocheting starter kit\u201d at an outfitters store. BTW, men knit, too. :-)\n \nWorking on art projects\n. We did a lot of that during the pandemic. Why not resurrect some of the activities from a few years ago? I mentioned taking up water-color painting in my last blog (finally scheduled for May \u2013 some things take a while to come to fruition).\n \nDoing\n\u00a0\njigsaw puzzles\n. \nThis is a still one of my favorite activities during colder weather. I currently have a very challenging 1000-piece jigsaw puzzle set up in my living room on a nifty new\u00a0\n\u201c\npuzzle board\n\u201d\n\u00a0that rotates.\n \nAnother \u201cphysical\u201d practice that many of us have lost touch with and that almost seems ancient and somewhat quaint now is\u00a0\nletter-writing\n. Yes, I mean a REAL letter, not a greeting card or a postcard (although those arrive at my house less and less frequently, too). I wrote about four or five letters this past year, and it was hard. My fingers were not used to holding a pen for so long, and my handwriting looked like that of a toddler towards the end of the letter. Still, I enjoyed this type of focused activity, and I felt good about the amount of physical and mental effort I had put into it once I was done. I also sometimes cut out newspaper articles and send them to friends \u2013 and they always comment on how touched they are to have received my letter. Why not surprise one of your loved ones with a special handwritten gift sometime?\n \n \nCommunity: Offerings for Practicing in Community\nAre you drawn to meditation?
