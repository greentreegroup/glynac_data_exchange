    "body": "Hello again,\nSorry to send another email today! But, I wanted to update you all about our plan for tomorrow. Tomorrow morning from 6:00am - 7:00am, we will practice before school at Bradley Fieldhouse. We are hoping that the field will be playable for tomorrow's game. If it is playable, the boys will go over to Horner Park after school. If it is not playable, we will not practice or meet after school since we're going to be practicing in the morning. I will send updates if things change.\nBest,\nCoach Hinkamp\nOn Wed, Apr 2, 2025 at 11:12\u202fAM Zachary Hinkamp <\nzhinkamp@depaulprep.org\n> wrote:\nHello all,\nI hope you're doing well! I'm reaching out to let you know that our game today against Riverside-Brookfield at Horner Park has been canceled due to weather. We will NOT be practicing today, so the boys have the day off! We are hoping to get this game rescheduled for this Friday (location to be determined). When this is finalized, I will circle back to let you all know. Tomorrow's game is also questionable based on the amount of rain we've gotten/will get throughout the day today, so I will let you and the boys know about that tomorrow when we know more.

We will now be playing on their Lower Level field, located behind their Varsity field. Their Varsity field is still underwater, but the Lower Level field is playable! The Frosh/Soph game against Deerfield has been moved to another location so we can play there. Also, the bus will be leaving from DCP at 3:00pm today. My apologies for not relaying this information earlier.\nLooking ahead to the remaining games on our schedule this week:\nTomorrow's game at Riverside Brookfield isn't looking great, as the weather is supposed to get a bit rough with a lot of rain. I will communicate to you and the boys when I get information about this.\u00a0\nFor Thursday, we play at home against Amundsen, but based on the amount of rain we get tomorrow, Hoerner might be unplayable so I will let you all know about that when I hear.\u00a0\nFriday the boys will have the day off of practice.\u00a0\nFinally, Saturday we have a 10:00am game at Niles North. There will not be a bus to take us to this game, so we ask that you/the boys get themselves to the field (I will let them know when to get there when we get closer to that day). Niles North is a turf field, so even with the projected rain in the forecast, I'm hoping we can still get this game in!\u00a0\nAgain, I will make sure to communicate with you and the boys when I get word on these games.\nBest,\nCoach Hinkamp\nBest,\nCoach Hinkamp\nOn Sun, Mar 30, 2025 at 2:36\u202fPM Zachary Hinkamp <\nzhinkamp@depaulprep.org\n> wrote:\nHello all,\nI hope you\u2019ve had a great weekend!

    "body": "Hello all,\nI hope you're doing well! I'm reaching out to let you know that our game today against Riverside-Brookfield at Horner Park has been canceled due to weather. We will NOT be practicing today, so the boys have the day off! We are hoping to get this game rescheduled for this Friday (location to be determined). When this is finalized, I will circle back to let you all know. Tomorrow's game is also questionable based on the amount of rain we've gotten/will get throughout the day today, so I will let you and the boys know about that tomorrow when we know more.

We will now be playing on their Lower Level field, located behind their Varsity field. Their Varsity field is still underwater, but the Lower Level field is playable! The Frosh/Soph game against Deerfield has been moved to another location so we can play there. Also, the bus will be leaving from DCP at 3:00pm today. My apologies for not relaying this information earlier.\nLooking ahead to the remaining games on our schedule this week:\nTomorrow's game at Riverside Brookfield isn't looking great, as the weather is supposed to get a bit rough with a lot of rain. I will communicate to you and the boys when I get information about this.\u00a0\nFor Thursday, we play at home against Amundsen, but based on the amount of rain we get tomorrow, Hoerner might be unplayable so I will let you all know about that when I hear.\u00a0\nFriday the boys will have the day off of practice.\u00a0\nFinally, Saturday we have a 10:00am game at Niles North. There will not be a bus to take us to this game, so we ask that you/the boys get themselves to the field (I will let them know when to get there when we get closer to that day). Niles North is a turf field, so even with the projected rain in the forecast, I'm hoping we can still get this game in!\u00a0\nAgain, I will make sure to communicate with you and the boys when I get word on these games.\nBest,\nCoach Hinkamp\nBest,\nCoach Hinkamp\nOn Sun, Mar 30, 2025 at 2:36\u202fPM Zachary Hinkamp <\nzhinkamp@depaulprep.org\n> wrote:\nHello all,\nI hope you\u2019ve had a great weekend!

How to Sell to the Government\nLearn More >>>\nHow to Sell to the Government\nSelling to the Federal Government seems daunting and for most people, knowing where to be is a massive challenge. Once you get in and develop a marketing plan, piece by piece things start to come together and the federal government then becomes like working with any large corporation.\nThe reality is that people want to do business with people they know. Federal employees must follow FAR (Federal Acquisitions Regulations) in their purchasing however they also need confidence that the services they are acquiring will meet their mission goals. This gives federal employees the ability to weigh past performance enough to go with firms they have a track record with.\nStep 1 \u2013 Getting Ready and Prospecting for Federal Business\nBuilding Lists of Key Decision Makers\nThere are sources such as sam.gov where you can look at awarded contracts and back into the contracting officers that awarded those contracts. This is a good way to build relationships and increase their confidence that you will be able to perform future work for their agency. Additionally, these contractors will sometimes have smaller projects they can award to you to \u201ctry you out\u201d. Only a small percentage of available contracts are posted on sam.gov, often sam.gov as a procurement avenue is reserved for needs that the federal government does not already have a vendor in mind for the procurement.\nSBA Certifications\nSBA Certifications also can help you by gaining introductions through letters of introduction by SBA Business Development Specialists. Federal procurement officers are more likely to respond to other federal employees than to outside businesses seeking to solicit them. Through meetings obtained in this manner often a procurement officer will tell you about the potential for a sole source or direct award contract or a set-aside contract that applies to your specific certification.\nSubcontracting\nMany firms start with subcontracting before they become prime contractors. Generally, this is advisable to all SBA certification holders except for 8(a) firms who should focus on prime contracts because 8(a) firms are only permitted to be in the 8(a) program for 9 years while the other certifications can be maintained and therefore are evergreen.\nOnce a firm makes contacts within an agency, they can then network within that agency, learn the lingo, and unique needs of that agency, and better position themselves for making the jump into federal contracting.\nGSA Schedules\nA GSA Schedule can be an effective way of breaking into the federal government. There are some business requirements such as years in business and being able to provide several references to obtain a contract. The GSA pre-vets your firm and this adds confidence to federal buyers, it also adds visibility, and the ability to bid on contracts only GSA contract holders can bid on through GSA-eBuy. A GSA Schedule also provides your firm with a government-wide contract so when you find an interested federal buyer you don\u2019t get the \u201cI would love to buy from you but... I have no FAR compliant way of doing so\u2026\u201d\nSam.gov formerly Fbo.gov\nEvery day firms find procurements that are a good match for their firm through sam.gov. Monitoring sam.gov for opportunities for your firm to bid on should be an important part of any federal sales break-in strategy.\nStep 2 \u2013 Target your Agencies\nYour firm needs to begin by getting the targets down to approximately three agencies. From there once you begin getting to know those agencies ideally you get it down to one. Your geographical service area and capabilities should match the needs of this agency. By focusing on this one agency, you will learn who the key decision makers are for your goods and services, what things matter most to an agency to tailor your offerings as well as key terminology and what role you can play in carving out a niche for your firm.\n\ufeff\nStep 3 \u2013 Take Advantage of Your Opportunity\nFederal Contact Performance Evaluation\nBeing vigilant in your communication with contracting officers about your performance on a contract is critical to achieving an \u201cexcellent\u201d performance evaluation. Below is a scale as to how your performance will be graded by federal agencies. A \u201cgood\u201d performance evaluation is the minimum level a firm should achieve if it hopes to continue working with the government. \u201cExcellent\u201d is how you build your business.\nFrom conversations we have had with contracting officers, all things being equal a firm with an \u201cexcellent\u201d rating can charge as much as 7% more and still be awarded the contract over a firm with a \u201cgood\u201d rating. Therefore, know that the extra effort you put in today to ensure the \u201cexcellent\u201d rating will come back as increased profits down the road.\nStep 4 \u2013 Leveraging Your Past Performance\nNow it is time to grow your firm into other areas. It is time to focus on GWACs (Government-wide Acquisition Contracts), IDIQs (Indefinite Delivery Indefinite Quantity Contracts), and BPAs (Blanket Purchase Agreements). These contracting vehicles gain your firm access to large buckets of money and a finite number of vendors. These contracts also help your firm to break into other federal agencies that will order from these contracting vehicles and grow your business.\u00a0\nFirms with SBA Certification at this point should be moving from Sole Source Contracts to Set-aside Contracts. Sole Source Contacts are indeed non-competitive; however, Set-aside contracts are generally much larger and still have modest competition. So, firms that are trying to increase their sales will make this shift.\nIf your firm can execute this marketing plan you should be able to become a large federal contractor in approximately 4 years.\nEmily Hatchel\n\ufeff859-360-1320\nwww.fedvital.com\n\ufeff\nQuestions?\n Contact us today 1-859-360-1320\nFedvital\n10500 Norbotten Dr\nFlorence Kentucky 41042\nUnited States \nYou are subscribed to this email as monica@lcwmail.com.\nClick here to modify your \npreferences\n or \nunsubscribe\n.",

It facilitates woman-owned businesses' acquisition of their first government contract and helps them maintain their business relationships with federal agencies.\nPoint 2: Impressive 2024 WOSB Statistics\nIn 2024, around 14,606 WOSB firms worked with the federal government, making a combined $27.6 billion in sales. On average, each of these firms got about $2.2 million in federal contracts. These numbers show the real value of having WOSB certification, proving it's a smart move for woman-owned small businesses.\nPoint 3: Enhancing Sales through GSA Schedule Contracts\nObtaining a GSA Schedule Contract will enable WOSB businesses to increase sales even further. Direct sales from GSA Schedules to 3,663 WOSB companies totaled $8.3 billion in 2024. That works up to roughly $2.3 million in sales for each company. Thus, WOSB companies can boost their government sales and fortify their market position by utilizing a GSA Schedule, which is an effective strategy.\nPoint 4: Seven Advantages of GSA Schedule for WOSB Firms\nContracting Vehicle:\n Provides a FAR-compliant method for federal buyers to make purchases, addressing a common struggle for small businesses.\nMarket Research Visibility:\n Increases visibility through GSA Advantage, the preferred site for federal buyers' market research.\nAccess to GSA e-buy:\n Offers a specialized bulletin board for solicitation, facilitating initial sales to target agencies and subsequent opportunities.\nGateway to GWACs:\n Positions WOSB firms to enter Governmentwide Acquisition Contracts, reducing administrative burdens and demonstrating competency.\nSubcontracting Opportunities:\n Expand opportunities as prime contractors using a GSA Schedule are not subject to audit, saving compliance efforts.\nFlexibility with Products and Services:\n Enables quick addition of new products and services to the repertoire through GSA MAS Contract modifications.\nNon-Schedule Items Inclusion:\n Permits the addition of non-schedule items for completing contracts, provided over fifty percent are purchased from the firm's GSA Schedule.\nCombining WOSB Certification with a GSA Schedule is a smart strategy for woman-owned small businesses in federal contracting. The 2024 statistics and the advantages of the GSA Schedule clearly show that this approach not only helps in getting initial contracts but also sets the stage for ongoing growth and success in the federal market. It's strongly recommended for eligible businesses to go for both certifications, leading to a significant threefold increase in sales opportunities.\nGive us a call for an in-depth discussion and get you started now.\nEmily Hatchel\n859-360-1320\nwww.ezwosb.com\nQuestions?\n Contact us today 1-859-360-1320\nEZWOSB\n10500 Norbotten Dr\nFlorence Kentucky 41042\nUnited States \nYou are subscribed to this email as monica@lcwmail.com.\nClick here to modify your \npreferences\n or \nunsubscribe\n.",

    "body": "Plus, concerts to put on your calendar this month. Here\u2019s what you need to know today.\n \n.\nTo view this email as a web page, click \nhere.\nTuesday - April 1, 2025\nToday's \nRundown\n is brought to you by WBEZ members and\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\nby Bianca Cseke\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\nGood afternoon! It\u2019s Tuesday and the first day of April, which means \ntulips\n will soon start blooming in the Chicago area. Here\u2019s what you need to know today.\n\u00a0 \n1.\nTrump\u2019s promised \u2018Liberation Day\u2019 of tariffs is coming. Here\u2019s what it could mean for you.\n\u00a0\nPresident Donald Trump says tomorrow will be \u201cLiberation Day\u201d \u2014 a moment when he plans to roll out a set of tariffs that he promises will free the United States from foreign goods. It is also possible the tariffs are short-lived if Trump feels he can cut a deal after imposing them.\nAt stake are family budgets, America\u2019s prominence as the world\u2019s leading financial power and the structure of the global economy, The Associated Press reports.\nMost economists say the tariffs would get passed along to consumers in the form of higher prices for automobiles, groceries, housing and other goods. Corporate profits could be lower and growth more sluggish. Trump maintains more companies would open factories to avoid the taxes, though that process could take three years or more.\nTreasury Secretary Scott Bessent has suggested tariffs would be a one-time price adjustment, rather than the start of an inflationary spiral. But Bessent\u2019s conclusion rests on tariffs being brief or contained, rather than leading other countries to retaliate with their own tariffs or bleeding into other sectors of the economy such as services. [\nAP\n]\n2.\nCTU bargainers approved a tentative contract deal. Here\u2019s what you need to know.\n\u00a0\nA key Chicago Teachers Union committee spent hours yesterday going through a hefty package of proposals before finally approving a tentative agreement with Chicago Public Schools. It\u2019s a significant step toward finalizing a deal on a new four-year contract, my colleagues Sarah Karp and Nader Issa report.\nCTU members will get 4% raises in the first year, then up to 5% in the next three. CPS also gave elementary school teachers an additional 10 minutes of planning time per day.\nThe proposed settlement cleared the hurdle of the union\u2019s \u201cbig bargaining team,\u201d a group of 65 educators that has negotiated with the school district for almost a year. The CTU\u2019s 730-member House of Delegates meets tomorrow, with a ratification vote by all 30,000 members expected in the next week or two.\nOnce CTU members ratify the contract, the school board will have to approve it. Because the previous contract expired last June, the board also will have to amend its current budget to provide retroactive pay increases. A vote on that budget amendment and the unsuccessful efforts by the mayor\u2019s office to convince CPS to make a city pension payment that covers CPS workers have been a major source of conflict at the board.

[\nChicago Sun-Times\n]\n4.\nNorthwestern faces another congressional investigation\n\u00a0\nThis time, the Committee on Education and the Workforce argues legal clinics at the law school are using tax dollars to \u201cengage in progressive-left political advocacy,\u201d Patrick Smith reports for WBEZ.\nThe committee, which last year called Northwestern President Michael Schill and other university presidents to testify about antisemitism on campus, is asking for the budgets and funders for all of the school\u2019s 20-plus legal clinics. It\u2019s also asking for the personnel file of professor Sheila Bedi, director of Northwestern\u2019s Community Justice and Civil Rights Clinic, which works on \u201credressing over-policing and mass imprisonment.\u201d\nGeorgetown University Law professor Deborah Epstein told WBEZ she believes the letter will, on its own, have an immediate negative impact on legal advocacy throughout the country. [\nWBEZ\n]\n5.\n10 concerts that showcase the best of Chicago\u2019s small and midsize club scene\n\u00a0\nBesides the new buds popping up in gardens and parks throughout the Chicago area, another sign of spring is an active music calendar.\u00a0\nWBEZ music contributor Mark Guarino compiled a list of shows to see this month.\nThis Friday, Canadian-born producer, songwriter and musician Daniel Lanois, who has worked on albums as enduring as U2\u2019s \nThe Joshua Tree\n and Peter Gabriel\u2019s \nSo\n, takes the stage at the Epiphany Center for the Arts.\nLater this month, bluegrass songwriter and mandolinist Sierra Hull plays at Thalia Hall in support of her latest record, \nA Tip Toe High Wire\n.\nYou can see the full list in the link. [\nWBEZ\n]\n\u00a0\nHere's what else is happening\n\u00a0\nThe White House said it\u2019s \u201ccase closed\u201d on the Signal group chat review. [\nNPR\n]\nProsecutors have been directed to seek the death penalty against UnitedHealthcare CEO killing suspect Luigi Mangione. [\nAP\n]\nNASCAR Chicago Street Race announced upcoming closures for its July 5\u20136 event. [\nChicago Sun-Times\n]\nChicago Public Media announced leadership changes atop the Sun-Times and WBEZ. [\nChicago Sun-Times\n]\n\u00a0\nOh, and one more thing...\n\u00a0\nJamie Gustafson draws dinosaurs, sharks and pretty much anything else from the natural world.\u00a0\nSome of his clients have included National Geographic, DK Smithsonian and scientists at Chicago\u2019s Field Museum, my colleague Stefano Esposito reports for the Chicago Sun-Times.\nGustafson said he makes artistic choices based on science.\n\u201cWhen I take too many liberties, you get the paleontology police after you,\u201d he said. \u201cMy least favorite thing is when someone ... says, \u2018That\u2019s not what it looked like.\u2019 \u201d [\nChicago Sun-Times\n]\n\u00a0\nTell me something good\n\u00a0\nWhat\u2019s the best book you\u2019ve read recently? I finally have some room on my library hold list, and I always feel like staying in for weeks after getting back from long trips.\nSam writes:\n\u201cI just finished reading John Green\u2019s newest book, \nEverything is Tuberculosis\n. It\u2019s a sobering tale of how TB still kills over a million people worldwide every year, but it also has uplifting stories of things that are being done globally to improve access to diagnostic tools and treatments. Highly recommended!\u201d\nJerry writes:\n\u201c\ufeffI love historical fiction, but I was skeptical that a book about an orphan in Venice during the early 18th century who learns to play the violin would hold my attention. I\u2019m not particularly partial to classical music, but I was intrigued when I learned the teacher was Vivaldi, famous for \nThe Four Seasons\n symphony, and the orphan was an abandoned baby girl left at a famous institution in Venice managed by nuns. That said, \nThe Instrumentalist\n by Harriet Constable, is one of the best books I\u2019ve read this year. I was engaged from the start and the story has layers of interesting characters and social commentary. Good read even if historical fiction is not your first choice.\u201d\nSue writes:\n\u201cI really enjoyed \nThe Husbands\n, by Holly Gramazio. I hate saying too much because I wouldn't want to spoil it. It really made me think and laugh and was so unexpected.

We will now be playing on their Lower Level field, located behind their Varsity field. Their Varsity field is still underwater, but the Lower Level field is playable! The Frosh/Soph game against Deerfield has been moved to another location so we can play there. Also, the bus will be leaving from DCP at 3:00pm today. My apologies for not relaying this information earlier.\nLooking ahead to the remaining games on our schedule this week:\nTomorrow's game at Riverside Brookfield isn't looking great, as the weather is supposed to get a bit rough with a lot of rain. I will communicate to you and the boys when I get information about this.\u00a0\nFor Thursday, we play at home against Amundsen, but based on the amount of rain we get tomorrow, Hoerner might be unplayable so I will let you all know about that when I hear.\u00a0\nFriday the boys will have the day off of practice.\u00a0\nFinally, Saturday we have a 10:00am game at Niles North. There will not be a bus to take us to this game, so we ask that you/the boys get themselves to the field (I will let them know when to get there when we get closer to that day). Niles North is a turf field, so even with the projected rain in the forecast, I'm hoping we can still get this game in!\u00a0\nAgain, I will make sure to communicate with you and the boys when I get word on these games.\nBest,\nCoach Hinkamp\nBest,\nCoach Hinkamp\nOn Sun, Mar 30, 2025 at 2:36\u202fPM Zachary Hinkamp <\nzhinkamp@depaulprep.org\n> wrote:\nHello all,\nI hope you\u2019ve had a great weekend!

    "body": "Plus: Wall Street Bonuses Surge | The New Ivies Employers Love To Hire From | Federal Workers Hit The Job Market\nBECOME A MEMBER\n\u00a0\u2022\u00a0\nNewsletters\n\u00a0\u2022\u00a0\nMyForbes\nHappy Billionaires Day! It\u2019s a busy one here at \nForbes,\n as we just released our annual list of the world\u2019s billionaires, highlighting the richest\u2013\u2013and arguably most powerful\u2013\u2013people and families across the globe.\u00a0\nIn total, \nForbes \ntracked and documented the wealth of more than \n3,000 people worth a collective $16.1 trillion\n. The average fortune on the list now stands at $5.3 billion, a $200 million increase from 2024.\u00a0\nWhile many of the world\u2019s billionaires inherited their wealth, nearly 70% of the newest names on this year\u2019s list are \nself-made\n, meaning they founded or cofounded the company that made them their billions. The newcomers include 73-year-old Sulaiman Al Habib, founder and chairman of Saudi Arabia hospital group HMG, as well as Scale AI cofounder and CEO Alexandr Wang, the list\u2019s youngest self-made billionaire at just 28 years old.\nWang is one of just 21 individuals this year to reach billionaire status \nunder the age of 30\n. Of those, only Wang and 29-year-old Ed Craven are self-made, with Craven being the cofounder of Stake.com, thought to be the world\u2019s biggest crypto-backed online casino.\nSo what\u2019s the secret to their riches? For newcomer billionaire Steve Ells, it was \nChipotle\u2019s compensation plan.\n Though Ells sold most of his stock throughout his time as CEO and then chairman of the board at the fast-casual chain, the company\u2019s compensation plan continued to award him Chipotle stock as it kept rising.\u00a0\nAnd while it was the ultimate sale of \nfried chicken chain Zaxby\n that netted its cofounders their billions, it\u2019s the hard work they put into growing the business that allowed it to grow. Cofounder Tony Townley kept his day job running a mortgaging and loan business while running the first Zaxby location, sometimes mixing sometimes until 5 a.m.\nIt goes to show that while entrepreneurship can be a struggle, it can certainly pay off.\u00a0\nYou can read more about the world\u2019s richest \nhere\n.\u00a0\nMaria Gracia Santillana Linares\u00a0\nCareers Reporter\nFollow me on\u00a0\nForbes.com\nWORK SMARTER\nPractical insights and advice from Forbes staff and contributors to help you succeed in your job, accelerate your career and lead smarter.\nSimply growing your network\n online won\u2019t cut it\u2013\u2013there is no substitute for \nin-person connections\n.\u00a0\nWhat you need to know about \ntariffs\n \nif you\u2019re in the job market.\u00a0\nIf you\u2019re preparing to answer\n behavioral questions \nin your next job interview, consider \nthe CARL method.\u00a0\nWhy you should consider a \ngig job \nin \nthis labor market.\u00a0\nDeep Dive\nThe total estimated bonus pool for Wall Street bankers reached a high not seen in nearly 40 years.\n\u00a0 \nPhoto by STAN HONDA/AFP via Getty Images\nWall Street Banker Bonuses Surge\nRead Article\nAfter a profitable year for Wall Street in 2024, its \nbankers are cashing-in on generous bonuses\n. The New York State Comptroller said last week that bankers\u2019 bonuses rose 31.5% from the previous year, contributing to a total estimated bonus pool of $47.5 billion.\u00a0\nThe increase in performance incentives is largely due to one of the best years in history for the stock market and dealmaking. The S&P 500 and Nasdaq Composite each had record years in 2024, and Wall Street\u2019s profits rose 90%.\u00a0\n\u201cMost of the time bonuses are based off of two things: What is your personal performance and what is the company\u2019s performance,\u201d says Nich Tremper, economist at payroll provider Gusto. \u201cIt\u2019s discretionary compensation based on those two things.\u201d\nAdd a securities employment increase\u2013\u2013coming in at 201,500 employees, the highest annual level in at least 30 years, according to New York Comptroller Thomas DiNapoli\u2013\u2013and you\u2019ve got more employees earning six-figure salaries that qualified for the bonuses. Indeed, average salaries for analysts range from $160,000 to $210,000 per year after bonuses. That number can rise up to $475,000 for associates.\u00a0\nBut Wall Street wasn\u2019t the only place to see bonuses increase, albeit at a much lower rate. Average end-of-year bonuses for 2024 were up 2% compared to 2023 payouts for small businesses, according to a January report from \nGusto\n, though the total share of workers who received bonuses decreased.\u00a0\nApart from Wall Street, those in the communications, technology and professional services industries saw the greatest bonus growth.\nRetail, for example, saw an 8% increase in bonuses from 2023 to 2024. But one major retailer held back from them altogether, citing fiscal year performance results. Salaried employees at Target who were eligible for bonuses will only receive 87% of their potential bonus for fiscal year 2024,\n\u00a0\nHR Dive reported\n, down from the 100% they received the previous year.\u00a0\nThe state of the economy has a large part to play in how much employers are distributing to their workers. \u201cA bonus is backwards-looking,\u201d says Tremper. \u201cBut it\u2019s also forwards-looking. It\u2019s a business owner deciding that they don\u2019t need to keep that cash in the bank account and can actually invest that into their employees.\u201d \nTOUCH BASE\n \nIt\u2019s impossible to ignore the mounting criticisms of America\u2019s most exclusive colleges. These 20 schools\u201410 public and 10 private\u2014are stepping up to educate the country\u2019s brightest students and graduating the talent employers seek.\n \nForbes\n \nNews from the world of work\nAs the Ivy Leagues continue to amass criticism from wealthy alumni, parents of students and even the federal government,\n \nForbes\n released its second iteration of the New Ivies\n list. Employers are increasingly looking at graduates from these 20 public and private universities, including newcomers Washington University in St. Louis, the University of Pittsburgh and the United States Military Academy at West Point, Emma Whitford \nreports\n.\u00a0\nTop vaccine official \nPeter Marks quit his position at the Federal Drug Administration (FDA)\n on Friday, criticizing Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F. Kennedy\u2019s views on vaccines and his \u201cmisinformation and lies.\u201d He\u2019s not the first\u2014and certainly not the last\u2014federal employee to \nclash with his new boss.\n\u00a0\nJust days later, cuts at HHS \nreportedly\n began. \nKennedy is expected to cut about a quarter of the department\u2019s workforce,\n \nabout 10,000 employees\n, across regional offices, the CDC, FDA, NIH, and the Centers for Medicaid and Medicare.\nJob applications from federal workers are surging\n, \nIndeed reports\n. USDA workers and those working in DEI roles are likely hitting the job market the most, as searches for horticulture and employee relations roles increased by more than 10 times compared to this time last year. While most federal employees looking for work are still in the Washington, D.C. and Virginia area, \nTexas, California and Georgia\n are not far behind.\u00a0\u00a0\nAre you worried about a potential recession and how it could impact your job? \nForbes\u2019\n Derek Saul has been \ntracking economists\u2019 recession warnings\n as \u201cLiberation Day\u201d tariffs loom. \nHere\u2019s why it\u2019s not time to worry yet.\u00a0\nGen X creatives are in a career meltdown\n, the \nNew York Times\n \nreports\n.

Ignoring federal and academic research showing the success of hybrid and remote models, these policies risk damaging public service efficiency and triggering costly turnover\u2014just as seen under Biden\u2019s more moderate RTO approach.\nTo learn more, check out this \nblog\n.\nRead Blog\n \nPrefer video to text?

After you leave this meeting, you're going to find out better ways of making decisions and the choices you make and the impact that it has on your business, your personal life, and your spiritual life.\"\n-\u200c \nChet Tart\n, Vistage Chair\nSchedule a Free Consultation\n \nWhat's Up With Me\nIt\u2019s a puzzle to me why so many things that appear to be solely data-informed become so politicized.\n Why did WFH grow so politicized, for example? It\u2019s not obvious at all that Republicans should favor government employees working in the office: after all, you can save a lot of money on real estate, as well as on hiring and retention costs, since people are willing to work for less and have better retention when they work remotely at least some of the time. Furthermore, productivity metrics and morale are higher when people can work remotely at least some of the time. But clearly, this issue did become politicized. Is it because of a lack of trust in public workers? Well, you can simply institute more clear accountability and tracking mechanisms, rather than forcing people back to the office, and losing all the benefits. It\u2019s a clear example where culture wars win out over good, common business sense.\u00a0\nWould love to get your feedback on what you found most useful about this edition of the \u201cWise Decision Maker Guide\u201d - simply reply to this email.\nDecisively Yours,\nDr. Gleb\nDr. Gleb Tsipursky\nCEO of Disaster Avoidance Experts\nPS: Are we connected on LinkedIn?
