    "body": "Plus: Wall Street Bonuses Surge | The New Ivies Employers Love To Hire From | Federal Workers Hit The Job Market\nBECOME A MEMBER\n\u00a0\u2022\u00a0\nNewsletters\n\u00a0\u2022\u00a0\nMyForbes\nHappy Billionaires Day! It\u2019s a busy one here at \nForbes,\n as we just released our annual list of the world\u2019s billionaires, highlighting the richest\u2013\u2013and arguably most powerful\u2013\u2013people and families across the globe.\u00a0\nIn total, \nForbes \ntracked and documented the wealth of more than \n3,000 people worth a collective $16.1 trillion\n. The average fortune on the list now stands at $5.3 billion, a $200 million increase from 2024.\u00a0\nWhile many of the world\u2019s billionaires inherited their wealth, nearly 70% of the newest names on this year\u2019s list are \nself-made\n, meaning they founded or cofounded the company that made them their billions. The newcomers include 73-year-old Sulaiman Al Habib, founder and chairman of Saudi Arabia hospital group HMG, as well as Scale AI cofounder and CEO Alexandr Wang, the list\u2019s youngest self-made billionaire at just 28 years old.\nWang is one of just 21 individuals this year to reach billionaire status \nunder the age of 30\n. Of those, only Wang and 29-year-old Ed Craven are self-made, with Craven being the cofounder of Stake.com, thought to be the world\u2019s biggest crypto-backed online casino.\nSo what\u2019s the secret to their riches? For newcomer billionaire Steve Ells, it was \nChipotle\u2019s compensation plan.\n Though Ells sold most of his stock throughout his time as CEO and then chairman of the board at the fast-casual chain, the company\u2019s compensation plan continued to award him Chipotle stock as it kept rising.\u00a0\nAnd while it was the ultimate sale of \nfried chicken chain Zaxby\n that netted its cofounders their billions, it\u2019s the hard work they put into growing the business that allowed it to grow. Cofounder Tony Townley kept his day job running a mortgaging and loan business while running the first Zaxby location, sometimes mixing sometimes until 5 a.m.\nIt goes to show that while entrepreneurship can be a struggle, it can certainly pay off.\u00a0\nYou can read more about the world\u2019s richest \nhere\n.\u00a0\nMaria Gracia Santillana Linares\u00a0\nCareers Reporter\nFollow me on\u00a0\nForbes.com\nWORK SMARTER\nPractical insights and advice from Forbes staff and contributors to help you succeed in your job, accelerate your career and lead smarter.\nSimply growing your network\n online won\u2019t cut it\u2013\u2013there is no substitute for \nin-person connections\n.\u00a0\nWhat you need to know about \ntariffs\n \nif you\u2019re in the job market.\u00a0\nIf you\u2019re preparing to answer\n behavioral questions \nin your next job interview, consider \nthe CARL method.\u00a0\nWhy you should consider a \ngig job \nin \nthis labor market.\u00a0\nDeep Dive\nThe total estimated bonus pool for Wall Street bankers reached a high not seen in nearly 40 years.\n\u00a0 \nPhoto by STAN HONDA/AFP via Getty Images\nWall Street Banker Bonuses Surge\nRead Article\nAfter a profitable year for Wall Street in 2024, its \nbankers are cashing-in on generous bonuses\n. The New York State Comptroller said last week that bankers\u2019 bonuses rose 31.5% from the previous year, contributing to a total estimated bonus pool of $47.5 billion.\u00a0\nThe increase in performance incentives is largely due to one of the best years in history for the stock market and dealmaking. The S&P 500 and Nasdaq Composite each had record years in 2024, and Wall Street\u2019s profits rose 90%.\u00a0\n\u201cMost of the time bonuses are based off of two things: What is your personal performance and what is the company\u2019s performance,\u201d says Nich Tremper, economist at payroll provider Gusto. \u201cIt\u2019s discretionary compensation based on those two things.\u201d\nAdd a securities employment increase\u2013\u2013coming in at 201,500 employees, the highest annual level in at least 30 years, according to New York Comptroller Thomas DiNapoli\u2013\u2013and you\u2019ve got more employees earning six-figure salaries that qualified for the bonuses. Indeed, average salaries for analysts range from $160,000 to $210,000 per year after bonuses. That number can rise up to $475,000 for associates.\u00a0\nBut Wall Street wasn\u2019t the only place to see bonuses increase, albeit at a much lower rate. Average end-of-year bonuses for 2024 were up 2% compared to 2023 payouts for small businesses, according to a January report from \nGusto\n, though the total share of workers who received bonuses decreased.\u00a0\nApart from Wall Street, those in the communications, technology and professional services industries saw the greatest bonus growth.\nRetail, for example, saw an 8% increase in bonuses from 2023 to 2024. But one major retailer held back from them altogether, citing fiscal year performance results. Salaried employees at Target who were eligible for bonuses will only receive 87% of their potential bonus for fiscal year 2024,\n\u00a0\nHR Dive reported\n, down from the 100% they received the previous year.\u00a0\nThe state of the economy has a large part to play in how much employers are distributing to their workers. \u201cA bonus is backwards-looking,\u201d says Tremper. \u201cBut it\u2019s also forwards-looking. It\u2019s a business owner deciding that they don\u2019t need to keep that cash in the bank account and can actually invest that into their employees.\u201d \nTOUCH BASE\n \nIt\u2019s impossible to ignore the mounting criticisms of America\u2019s most exclusive colleges. These 20 schools\u201410 public and 10 private\u2014are stepping up to educate the country\u2019s brightest students and graduating the talent employers seek.\n \nForbes\n \nNews from the world of work\nAs the Ivy Leagues continue to amass criticism from wealthy alumni, parents of students and even the federal government,\n \nForbes\n released its second iteration of the New Ivies\n list. Employers are increasingly looking at graduates from these 20 public and private universities, including newcomers Washington University in St. Louis, the University of Pittsburgh and the United States Military Academy at West Point, Emma Whitford \nreports\n.\u00a0\nTop vaccine official \nPeter Marks quit his position at the Federal Drug Administration (FDA)\n on Friday, criticizing Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F. Kennedy\u2019s views on vaccines and his \u201cmisinformation and lies.\u201d He\u2019s not the first\u2014and certainly not the last\u2014federal employee to \nclash with his new boss.\n\u00a0\nJust days later, cuts at HHS \nreportedly\n began. \nKennedy is expected to cut about a quarter of the department\u2019s workforce,\n \nabout 10,000 employees\n, across regional offices, the CDC, FDA, NIH, and the Centers for Medicaid and Medicare.\nJob applications from federal workers are surging\n, \nIndeed reports\n. USDA workers and those working in DEI roles are likely hitting the job market the most, as searches for horticulture and employee relations roles increased by more than 10 times compared to this time last year. While most federal employees looking for work are still in the Washington, D.C. and Virginia area, \nTexas, California and Georgia\n are not far behind.\u00a0\u00a0\nAre you worried about a potential recession and how it could impact your job? \nForbes\u2019\n Derek Saul has been \ntracking economists\u2019 recession warnings\n as \u201cLiberation Day\u201d tariffs loom. \nHere\u2019s why it\u2019s not time to worry yet.\u00a0\nGen X creatives are in a career meltdown\n, the \nNew York Times\n \nreports\n. Right when they should be at the peak of their career, advertising and media workers in their late 40s and 50s are trying to play catch-up in an industry now dominated by cheap, fast social media content, influencers and generative AI.\nNUMBER TO NOTE\n$293 million\nThat\u2019s how much movies that had gender balanced cast and crew made at the worldwide box office, on average, in 2024\u2014more than double those that didn\u2019t, according to \na new study.\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\nVIDEO\nHow DOGE Cuts Are Impacting U.S. Businesses\nWatch Video\nQUIZ\nThe Federal Communications Commission said it will investigate which major entertainment studio over its DEI practices among both its employees and its content?\nA.\nUniversal Studios\nB.\nDisney\nC.\nWarner Bros.\nD.\nNetflix\nCheck if you got it \nright here.\nMORE FROM FORBES\nThe Founders Of This Lululemon Rival Are Worth Nearly $5 Billion Each\nRead Article\n \nThese Childhood Best Friends Made Billion-Dollar Fortunes From Chicken Fingers\nRead Article\n \nGwynne Shotwell Rides SpaceX To Billion-Dollar Fortune\nRead Article\n \nExclusive Membership Offer\n \n \nFor a limited time only, unlock the best of Forbes\u2014including the articles featured in today\u2019s newsletter\u2014for just $49.99/year.

Ignoring federal and academic research showing the success of hybrid and remote models, these policies risk damaging public service efficiency and triggering costly turnover\u2014just as seen under Biden\u2019s more moderate RTO approach.\nTo learn more, check out this \nblog\n.\nRead Blog\n \nPrefer video to text?

It\u2019s not obvious at all that Republicans should favor government employees working in the office: after all, you can save a lot of money on real estate, as well as on hiring and retention costs, since people are willing to work for less and have better retention when they work remotely at least some of the time. Furthermore, productivity metrics and morale are higher when people can work remotely at least some of the time. But clearly, this issue did become politicized. Is it because of a lack of trust in public workers? Well, you can simply institute more clear accountability and tracking mechanisms, rather than forcing people back to the office, and losing all the benefits. It\u2019s a clear example where culture wars win out over good, common business sense.\u00a0\nWould love to get your feedback on what you found most useful about this edition of the \u201cWise Decision Maker Guide\u201d - simply reply to this email.\nDecisively Yours,\nDr. Gleb\nDr. Gleb Tsipursky\nCEO of Disaster Avoidance Experts\nPS: Are we connected on LinkedIn?

    "body": "Hello all,\nI'm reaching out to let you know that there is a slight change for our game at Deerfield High School this afternoon at 4:30pm. We will now be playing on their Lower Level field, located behind their Varsity field. Their Varsity field is still underwater, but the Lower Level field is playable! The Frosh/Soph game against Deerfield has been moved to another location so we can play there. Also, the bus will be leaving from DCP at 3:00pm today. My apologies for not relaying this information earlier.\nLooking ahead to the remaining games on our schedule this week:\nTomorrow's game at Riverside Brookfield isn't looking great, as the weather is supposed to get a bit rough with a lot of rain. I will communicate to you and the boys when I get information about this.\u00a0\nFor Thursday, we play at home against Amundsen, but based on the amount of rain we get tomorrow, Hoerner might be unplayable so I will let you all know about that when I hear.\u00a0\nFriday the boys will have the day off of practice.\u00a0\nFinally, Saturday we have a 10:00am game at Niles North. There will not be a bus to take us to this game, so we ask that you/the boys get themselves to the field (I will let them know when to get there when we get closer to that day). Niles North is a turf field, so even with the projected rain in the forecast, I'm hoping we can still get this game in!\u00a0\nAgain, I will make sure to communicate with you and the boys when I get word on these games.\nBest,\nCoach Hinkamp\nBest,\nCoach Hinkamp\nOn Sun, Mar 30, 2025 at 2:36\u202fPM Zachary Hinkamp <\nzhinkamp@depaulprep.org\n> wrote:\nHello all,\nI hope you\u2019ve had a great weekend!

    "body": "As March comes to a close, we look to Transgender Day of Visibility (TDOV) on March 31\u2014a time to celebrate the resilience, brilliance, and achievements of transgender and nonbinary people everywhere. TDOV is not just about visibility itself, but about what visibility makes possible: greater understanding, stronger communities, and a world where transgender youth can thrive as their authentic selves.\nWe invite you to reflect on the powerful stories shared this month. Visibility matters, and so does action. From Champion Lily\u2019s panel at the NLGJA Student Conference to Champion Shailen\u2019s feature on Germany\u2019s ZDF, our work continues to spark meaningful conversations and change perspectives.\nBy supporting GenderCool\n, you help ensure that more people around the world see transgender and nonbinary youth for who they truly are: leaders, innovators, and changemakers shaping the future.\nRead on to see how GenderCool is celebrating Women\u2019s History Month and amplifying transgender voices in the media.\n \n \nMarch marks Women\u2019s History Month, a time to honor and celebrate the countless contributions of women who have shaped history and continue to inspire future generations. From pioneers in science and the arts to trailblazers in business and advocacy, women have long driven progress and forged paths toward a more inclusive world.\nAt GenderCool, we take this opportunity to uplift the voices of all women\u2014including transgender women\u2014whose brilliance and resilience have helped create the world we know today. Women\u2019s History is trans history, and the impact of transgender women across industries and movements is undeniable. Their courage, creativity, and leadership have paved the way for future generations to dream bigger and achieve more.\nAs an organization rooted in storytelling, we remain committed to amplifying the voices of women who are shaping a more inclusive future. The intersectionality of social justice reminds us that true progress means recognizing and celebrating all women.\nThroughout March, we\u2019ve highlighted trailblazing women whose contributions continue to inspire and empower. If you missed any of our spotlights, you can still check out our social channels to celebrate their impact and learn more about the leaders shaping a more inclusive future\u2014because the journey toward equality doesn\u2019t end when the month does.\nTogether, we honor the legacy of women\u2019s history while forging a brighter future.\n \n \nOn March 8, GenderCool Champion Lily (she/her) joined the NLGJA Student Conference as a panelist for \u201cCovering Transgender, Nonbinary, and Gender-Non-Conforming Communities.\u201d Speaking alongside Joseph Jaafari, Editor-in-Chief of LookOut, and Tat Bellamy-Walker, Program Manager for Digital Safety Training and Resources, Lily shared her experiences working with the media and the importance of accurate, authentic representation of transgender people in journalism.\nThis opportunity directly aligns with GenderCool\u2019s mission through helping to educate the next generation of journalists on how to responsibly and respectfully cover transgender and nonbinary stories. By equipping media students with the knowledge and perspective needed to tell these stories with care, Lily is helping to shape a future where transgender and nonbinary people are represented appropriately.\n \n \nOn March 9, an interview featuring GenderCool Champion Shailen and his family aired on ZDF, a leading news program in Germany. Filmed at Shailen\u2019s home, this segment introduced audiences to Shailen\u2019s story, providing an opportunity for viewers\u2014many of whom may have never met a transgender person\u2014to learn more about who he is in an authentic and personal way.\nFor those in our newsletter audience not fluent in German, here is a loose translation. \u201cFifteen-year-old Shailen has always known who he is. At twelve, he discovered the term transgender and embraced it fully. With the support of his family and friends, he began living openly as himself.\nDespite challenges faced by the transgender community, Shailen remains determined to live his life like any other teenager. He dreams of becoming an engineer and finds joy in everyday moments, like going to the movies with friends and playing guitar. His family is part of a nationwide project that amplifies the voices of trans youth, showing the world that they are just like other kids\u2014with hopes, dreams, and a deep sense of belonging.\nAs Shailen says, \u201cWe all have to work together as a team.\u201d His story is a reminder of the power of community, resilience, and the importance of standing together for a more inclusive future.\u201d\nThis interview is a powerful example of how GenderCool connects with new audiences, fostering understanding through storytelling. By sharing lived experiences, we help reshape narratives and create a world where transgender and nonbinary young people are seen for who they truly are.\nWatch the Segment Here!\n \n \n \nThis Transgender Day of Visibility, Out Leadership and The GenderCool Project are proud to introduce \"Hear Us Out\"\u2014a groundbreaking video series amplifying the voices of transgender and nonbinary leaders. Featuring 19 compelling personal stories, this campaign cuts through the noise, offering an unfiltered look at the experiences, resilience, and impact of trans and nonbinary individuals across industries, generations, and backgrounds.\nAt a time when misinformation and harmful rhetoric are on the rise, \"Hear Us Out\" brings clarity and humanity to a critical conversation. With over 800 anti-trans bills introduced across 49 states, these stories replace fear with understanding\u2014showcasing the strength and determination of the trans and nonbinary community.\nThe campaign highlights an inspiring array of individuals whose stories redefine what\u2019s possible:\nMila Jam, a Black trans woman and corporate advisor, shares: \u201cThere was a time when corporate doors were closed to people like me. Now, I\u2019m helping to build inclusive workplaces.\u201d\nAshton, a Gen Z advocate and GenderCool Champion, declares: \u201cWe are everywhere.

This exclusive program, designed to help disadvantaged businesses compete in the federal marketplace, offers significant advantages that drive growth, profitability, and long-term success. Here are 10 compelling reasons to pursue 8(a) certification:\nBenefit 1: Sole Sourcing\n8(a) firms can receive sole-source contracts, bypassing the traditional competitive bidding process. This streamlines procurement and can secure contracts before competitors are even aware of the opportunity. Sole-sourcing limits are set at $4.5 million for goods and services and $7 million for manufacturing. Often, established 8(a) firms can rely solely on sole-source contracts, reducing the need to participate in competitive bids.\nBenefit 2: Limited Competition\n8(a) certification significantly reduces competition for federal contracts. Out of approximately 24 million U.S. businesses, only around 6,500 have obtained 8(a) certification. The federal government allocates 5% of its annual contracting budget\u2014over $34 billion\u2014to 8(a) firms, equating to over $4 million per firm annually.\nBenefit 3: Streamlined Federal Contracting\nThe SBA serves as a liaison, facilitating introductions to federal agencies and reducing the time needed to secure contracts. This support helps 8(a) firms quickly establish relationships and win contracts.\nBenefit 4: Access to Large Contracts\nThrough joint ventures or mentor-prot\u00e9g\u00e9 arrangements, 8(a) firms can partner with other businesses, including large federal prime contractors. This enables access to contracts that would otherwise be unattainable and helps build performance history.\nBenefit 5: Pricing Advantages\nWith fewer competitors, 8(a) firms often command better pricing than non-8(a) small businesses.\nBenefit 6: Accelerated Growth\n8(a) firms experience faster growth, often appearing in lists of top federal IT contractors. The certification enables rapid expansion within federal markets.\nBenefit 7: Enhanced GSA Schedule Effectiveness\n8(a) certification amplifies the value of a GSA Schedule. Federal buyers prioritize 8(a) firms on GSA Advantage, providing a significant competitive edge.\nBenefit 8: Construction Contractor Success\n8(a) firms excel in federal construction contracts, with over 40% of 8(a) firms in the construction sector. The Department of Defense accounts for a significant portion of federal construction spending.\nBenefit 9: Emergency Response Opportunities\n8(a) firms are uniquely positioned to respond to FEMA and disaster recovery contracts, capitalizing on rapid sole-source awards. Over $11.5 billion is spent annually on disaster response, with many contracts awarded to 8(a) firms.\nBenefit 10: Transition to Large Business\nApproximately 30% of 8(a) firms leverage their government experience to become major federal prime contractors after graduating from the program, often achieving over $100 million in annual revenue.\n8(a) certification is a powerful tool that can unlock substantial growth opportunities, enhance market positioning, and secure long-term success in the federal marketplace. If you\u2019re ready to explore the benefits of 8(a) certification for your business, give us a call today. We\u2019re here to help you navigate the process and achieve your federal contracting goals!\nMark Ryan & Todd Luttenegger\n859-442-3300\nwww.ez8a.com\nez8a\n10500 Norbotten Dr\nFlorence Kentucky 41042\nUnited States \nYou are subscribed to this email as monica@lcwmail.com.\nClick here to modify your \npreferences\n or \nunsubscribe\n.",

It was a tough hearing \u2014 one marked by accusations of bias and calls to defund the very institutions that so many rely on for trusted, independent journalism.\nAt Chicago Public Media, we watched closely. And I want to speak plainly.\nPublic media isn\u2019t partisan. It\u2019s public.\nOur journalism is guided by a clear and unwavering code of ethics rooted in \naccuracy, fairness, independence and truth\n. These principles are not just words on a wall \u2014 they shape every story we report, every question we ask and how we show up for the Chicago community we serve. We are here to inform, so that you can decide. To listen deeply, elevate community voices and to report facts.\nWe believe journalism is a public trust, one protected by the First Amendment because a healthy democracy depends on an informed citizenry. That\u2019s why we work every day to make news and information accessible to all, especially those who are often left out of the conversation.\nThis work has never been easy. But it has never felt more important.\nChicago Public Media has always stood for something bigger than any one headline in the paper or story for the broadcast. We are here to strengthen civic life, hold power to account and amplify the diverse voices that make this region what it is. We are human-centered, empathetic and deeply rooted in our communities because journalism should reflect the people it serves.\nThat\u2019s why we\u2019re pushing forward: Because we know that in a time of rising polarization and growing distrust, the answer is not to shrink back \u2014 it's to lean in. To be even more transparent. Even more inclusive. Even more committed to the truth.\nWe are proud to be a member station of NPR. We stand with our colleagues across the country who believe that facts and fairness are essential and that the public deserves journalism that provides information free from commercial influence.\nThank you for believing in this mission alongside us. \nYour support isn\u2019t just helping fund a newsroom\n \n\u2014 it\u2019s helping protect a cornerstone of our democracy.\nOnwards,\nMelissa Bell\nCEO, Chicago Public Media\nMatching Gifts\nCar Donation\nGift of Securities\nPlanned Giving\n\u00a9Chicago Public Media Inc 848 East Grand Ave, Navy Pier Chicago, IL 60611 \nUnsubscribe from WBEZ Membership emails\nPlease do not reply to this email.

Here\u2019s what you need to know today.\n \n.\nTo view this email as a web page, click \nhere.\nMonday - March 31, 2025\nToday's \nRundown\n is brought to you by WBEZ members and\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\nby Bianca Cseke\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\nGood afternoon! It\u2019s Monday, and meteorologists expect more springtime \nstorms\n this week. Here\u2019s what else you need to know today.\n\u00a0 \n1.\nWith Chicago\u2019s mass transit system on the fiscal precipice, what solutions are on the table?\n\u00a0\nThe clock is ticking for state lawmakers to find more than $700 million for the CTA, Metra, Pace and Regional Transportation Authority before they run out of federal COVID-19 grants next year and resort to drastic cuts in service.\nState lawmakers remain focused on reforming Chicago mass transit. Yet legislators have all but refused to talk about immediate funding solutions, David Struett and \u00a0George Wiebe report for the Chicago Sun-Times.\nOne of the quickest options may be to redirect the state\u2019s federal highway funds to public transit in a process called \u201cflexing,\u201d though this would require approval from the Illinois Department of Transportation.\nLawmakers are also considering several taxes, including a progressive income tax, expanding the sales tax to cover services and a \u201croad usage charge\u201d based on how many miles motorists drive.\nMeanwhile, the RTA has suggested raising fares 10% across the board, netting $50 million in annual funding. However, this would only cover part of the budget gap, and opponents argue this plan would hurt low-income riders who rely on public transit the most. [\nChicago Sun-Times\n]\n2.\nOut-of-state donors have made the Wisconsin Supreme Court race the most expensive judicial election in U.S. history\n\u00a0\nAbortion rights, voting rights and the powers of public employee unions could all be in the balance at the state level in the court\u2019s future rulings, NPR reports.\nNationally, the court could determine whether Wisconsin redraws its congressional districts along lines that end up narrowing or ending the majority Republicans hold in the U.S. House.\nThis race would replace one of the four liberal-leaning judges on the seven-judge court for a 10-year term.\nWith so much at stake, donors have poured their support into the race, including Illinois Gov. JB Pritzker and billionaire Trump adviser \nElon Musk\n. The latter handed out $1 million to two people over the weekend after a legal back-and-forth on whether the money amounted to bribing voters.\nTomorrow\u2019s vote could be the first measure of Trump\u2019s popularity and Democrats\u2019 energy after the presidential election five months ago. It could also be a referendum on Musk, who has been pushing for \ndrastic cuts in the federal government\n through the so-called Department of Government Efficiency. [\nNPR\n]\nSPONSOR MESSAGE FROM\nNORTHWESTERN MCCORMICK SCHOOL OF ENGINEERING\nNorthwestern\u2019s MS in IT\nNorthwestern Engineering's MS in Information Technology program prepares students for the fast-paced challenges of senior IT leadership roles through a 70% technical and 30% business and management curriculum.\nJoin our online information session on April 8 to discover our unique blend of courses, diverse student body, and coursework. \nRegister here.\n3.\nDCFS repeatedly failed to produce critical reports required after kids\u2019 deaths or injuries\n\u00a0\nThe state agency responsible for keeping Illinois\u2019 most vulnerable children safe has failed to produce legally required public reports on hundreds of child deaths and thousands of serious injuries, an Illinois Answers Project investigation reports.\nMore than 1,200 deaths and more than 3,000 other cases of serious injury have met the criteria for \u201cincident-specific\u201d reports since July 2018, according to data the state Department of Children and Family Services released in response to a public records request.\nThose reports are required when a child dies as a result of suspected abuse or neglect, or if a child dies or suffers a serious injury while in the state\u2019s care.\nThe failure spurred criticism from child welfare advocates and prompted the Cook County public guardian to call for an investigation. [\nIllinois Answers Project\n]\n4.\nMayor Johnson named a longtime police oversight investigator as interim COPA chief administrator\n\u00a0\nMayor Brandon Johnson has picked an experienced police accountability investigator to temporarily lead Chicago\u2019s police oversight agency while the city conducts a nationwide search for the agency\u2019s next permanent leader, my colleague Kade Heather reports.\nLaKenya White was tabbed interim chief administrator for the Civilian Office of Police Accountability. She brings 25 years of experience in various police oversight roles, including eight years with COPA since the agency was created.\nWhite replaces Andrea Kersten, who resigned last month amid allegations of presiding over investigations with anti-police bias. [\nChicago Sun-Times\n]\n5.\nMichael Shannon, movie director, sinks into the dark aftermath of an American school shooting\n\u00a0\nThe actor swore he\u2019d never direct a movie \u2014 until playwright Brett Neveu, Shannon\u2019s friend and fellow Red Orchid Theatre ensemble member, handed him a script on the closing night of a play they did together in 2018.\nThe script was a screen adaptation of \nEric LaRue\n, a searing stage production about the aftermath of a school shooting, my colleague Courtney Kueppers reports for WBEZ.\nWhen Neveu originally wrote the play in 1998, the Columbine High School massacre in Colorado had not yet happened. Neither had the 2012 shooting at Connecticut\u2019s Sandy Hook Elementary, which left 26 people dead, mostly first graders. Nor had the one at Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School in Parkland, Florida (2018) or Robb Elementary in Uvalde, Texas (2022).\nOver the years, Neveu\u2019s prescient story of anguish has remained startlingly relevant. Now, Neveu and Shannon are hoping the movie adaptation \u2014 which unflinchingly lingers in the suffering of the survivors \u2014 will renew a conversation.

    "subject": "DePaul JV Baseball: Update for Team Parents on Plans for the Season",
    "body": "Hello again JV Baseball Parents:\nWith a few games under our belts, it's time for a few updates.\u00a0\n1. We only heard from one parent about a food allergy for their player.\u00a0\nPlease let us know if your son has an allergy that we might have missed.\n2. Many of you wrote to say you prefer that we collect money up front and then have restaurant meals provided for the boys for as many games as possible. Given the large number of games on our schedule and\u00a0wanting to keep the\u00a0amount collected reasonable, we landed on $150 via Venmo or Zelle per family to cover our\u00a0\n18 school-night-away games\n;\u00a0\nthe thought being that for Horner Park and Saturday games, the boys can more easily manage food on their own. This\u00a0\nspreadsheet\n\u00a0lists all the game\u00a0times and locations. As Team Parents, we (Kelly, Andrea and Monica) will order the\u00a0meals for delivery to DCP 20 to 30 minutes before the bus takes off for the 18 school-night-away-games, and we'll supplement with bulk snacks. With that in mind:\nPlease send $150 to cover a meal to Kelly Fox via Venmo: @kelly-fox-38 or Zelle:\u00a0\nkellyfox99@gmail.com\n\u00a0 312-339-8697 -- \nOR IF YOU PREFER\nFeel free to\u00a0\nsign up\n\u00a0for a specific game, then drop off food to feed 24 (20 players + 4 staff)\u00a0\n20 minutes before bus is scheduled to depart DCP on the date you selected\n.\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\nIf you'd also like to contribute bulk purchased snacks (for example: a 50 bag box of chips, 5 lb bag of mandarin oranges, etc), you can drop them off this week with Andrea, Kelly or Monica at Horner Park games and we'll handle distribution at a future game.\u00a0\n3. Please also remind your son to use the free water fountains at school to refill their individual water bottles before games. This will not only help boys stay well-hydrated, but will also help avoid the trash (and cost) of dozens of plastic water/gatorade bottles per game.\n4. A big\u00a0thank you to\u00a0\nSuzanne Amaro,\u00a0\n\u00a0for producing laminated roster cards for each family (see attached). If you didn't get yours at last Saturday's game, please see her. It is awesome.\u00a0\n5.\u00a0\nJessica Castellanos\n\u00a0is setting up a group text chain for us. If you'd like to be included, please sign up here:\u00a0\nDePaul Parent JV Baseball Thread\n. It will be a great way to stay connected regarding any future last minute game location changes or weather delays, etc.\n6. Finally, a shout out to\u00a0\nRob Zumph and Nick Amaro\n\u00a0for the pop-up tailgate they planned last Saturday, when our game location switched to Kerry Wood Field. This was such a great idea, and we look forward to many more opportunities to gather over the season.\u00a0\nWe appreciate all of you who shared ideas for building on your past experiences as sports parents and making the season great.\u00a0\nPlease keep your ideas coming, and thanks in advance for just jumping in wherever and whenever your heart leads you this season.\u00a0\u00a0\n#GoRams\n2025 DCP JV Baseball Team Parents\u00a0\nKelly Fox 312 339 8697, Andre Gosz 312 731 2247, Monica Marcel 773 209 8447",

    "body": "Icebreaker, Member Spotlight, and Upcoming Events!\n\u200a\n \n\u200a\n \nHello!\nWelcome to PWCC\u2019s March newsletter! Explore this edition for details on upcoming events, ways to get involved, and special features highlighting you\u2014our valued PWCC members!\n \nIcebreaker\nEach month, we ask \nyou\n, our members, an icebreaker question and kick-off the newsletter by sharing a few selected answers from the previous month\u2019s question.\nLast month we asked:\nIs there a woman from history who has inspired you? Whether this historical figure made waves in the past or is making history now we\u2019d love to hear about it!\n\"Hetty Green was an incredible woman who became the wealthiest woman in America during the Gilded Age (1870s-1890s), even though women faced huge obstacles in business at the time. Laws often kept them from owning property or participating in financial markets. She had an incredible knack for investing and one of her most impressive moves was bailing out New York City in 1878 when it was on the brink of bankruptcy. Hetty\u2019s story shows that, despite the odds, women could and can achieve remarkable financial success through grit and smart decision-making.\u201d\nAlexia Jackson\n\u200b\u200bWealth Management Advisor, Merrill\n\u201cChoosing just one woman from history who has inspired me is a difficult task\u2014especially as someone with an MA in Public History who studied women who fought for agency in their time. There are countless stories that have moved and motivated me. But in honor of Women\u2019s History Month, I\u2019ll highlight a well-known figure who continues to inspire me: Eleanor Roosevelt.\nEleanor Roosevelt once said, 'Do what you feel in your heart to be right\u2014for you\u2019ll be criticized anyway.' She truly lived by those words. Born before women even had the right to vote, she emerged as a powerful political force in her own right. Long before it was common\u2014or accepted\u2014for women to hold office or speak publicly on major issues, Eleanor used her platform to champion civil rights, human rights, and women\u2019s equality. She wasn\u2019t afraid to speak her mind, even when it meant facing harsh criticism. In fact, she was often more popular\u2014and more controversial\u2014than her husband, President Franklin D. Roosevelt.\nWhat I admire most is her unwavering commitment to doing what she believed was right, no matter the opposition. That\u2019s a value I try to carry into my own life and work: to speak up, to stand firm, and to act with integrity, even when it\u2019s hard.\u201d\nMary DeMars\nDirector, Walk to End Alzheimer's\n\ufeff\u201cPrincess Diana was a true example of grace, elegance, and individuality. Princess Diana stood up for what she believed in and won the hearts of many - earning her the nickname 'The People's Princess.' Unafraid to break outdated Royal norms, she omitted the word 'obey' from her wedding vows, which was a long-standing Royal tradition. She had the biggest heart - not only for her two sons, but also for the hundreds of charities she supported. The world collectively mourned her passing in 1997 but her legacy truly lives on!\u201d\nJen Adams\nDirector of Development - Gratitude Generation\n\u201cI have been a nerd for women leaders since my dad gave me my first \nFortune's Most Powerful Women\n issue in high school, so it's hard to narrow it down! So, I could share a long list of women leaders who broke barriers.\nBut, the first one I remember is Amelia Bloomer. I wrote a paper on her and her 'bloomers' in 6th grade because I was fascinated by the fashion choice as much as how it was a bold statement of 'I will do what I want' for women to claim the freedom of moving easily in the world (unencumbered by heavy skirts).'\"\nCatherine Cassidy\nFounder & CEO\nThanks for sharing your responses!\u00a0\n \nTell us about yourself! Submit to the next newsletter\u2019s Icebreaker Question.\nNext month\u2019s icebreaker question: \nHow do you prepare for spring? Whether it\u2019s resetting your goals, spring cleaning, or getting out and enjoying the weather, we want to hear about it.\nTo submit your answers for the April newsletter, \nplease fill out this form\n by \nWednesday, April 23rd\n. We will select a few responses that we receive to feature in the next newsletter!\n \nEach month, we feature a member of PWCC! This month we\u2019re featuring PWCC member \nKaren Jones\n.\n \nMember Spotlight\nKaren Jones\u00a0\nRecently retired as a Senior Vice President, Private Client Advisor at Bank of America 4/1/25\nWhen did you join PWCC?\n\u00a0\n2005\nTell us about yourself. Your line of work? Your hobbies?\u00a0\nRetired after 40+ years of working with Fortune 100 firms, small businesses, individuals and families. Expertise in all areas of financial management, reporting, wealth preservation and planning, including investment strategies, trust services, custom credit solutions, philanthropy and private banking. Prior work experience included working with firms in Financial Management, Mergers and Acquisitions, Sales Management and Business Development. I have founded and developed two profitable start-up companies.\u00a0\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\nMy husband and I love to travel, spend time with family and friends, I enjoy a daily walk, bike vacations and hiking. Love contemporary art and meeting and supporting emerging artists!\n\u00a0\nAs a past president of PWCC,\u00a0what changes and goals did you work towards during your term? Were there any lessons learned during your time as president of PWCC?\nAs past president, I was very fortunate and grateful to work with an amazing board of professional women who are long time colleagues and dear friends. Bravo to the incredible leaders ahead of me that paved the road to success! We worked together to increase and retain membership by hard work, corporate sponsors, having an incredible lineup of speakers-kicked off year with Stephanie Izard, top chef and restaurant entrepreneur.\u00a0\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\nLessons learned: Working together as a team for a common goal in empowering women at every level or circumstance is incredibly rewarding both professionally and personally. Never underestimate the power of your network and lastly have fun!\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\n\u00a0\nHow do you stay motivated?\u00a0\nI am very fortunate to have a supportive husband, family and incredible coworkers and colleagues that support me. I stay motivated by living each day with purpose, faith, fun, laughter and helping each other.\u00a0\nSince time is a precious commodity, how do you make decisions about how to spend your time?\u00a0\nFamily first, prioritize your goals, make a daily list and if you don't finish move to the next day/week, etc. If you cannot commit to a task or endeavor it's OK to take a pass and move on.\u00a0\nIs there anything you are currently working on that you would like to share?\u00a0\nCurrently volunteering on three boards: 1: Endeavor (formerly NorthShore healthcare system) I am Chair of the Planned Giving Advisory Council, 2: Chicago Artists Coalition as Vice Chair and 3: St. Ignatius Business Society, Founding member and Membership Director.\u00a0I am currently seeking a paid board position with a few local Chicago based public and private firms.\nThanks to Karen for answering our questions.\n \n \nAre you interested in being featured in our newsletter?\n\ufeff\nIf you would like to be featured in the Member Spotlight section, please submit to our \nform\n \nfor consideration.\n \nDon't miss these upcoming events!\nWe have a ton of great events in April!

Miles will be credited to your account 8-12 weeks after you reach the Threshold Amount. Bonus Miles may appear on your account in more than one deposit. To receive the 110,000 bonus miles, your Card account must not be canceled or past due at the time of fulfillment. Eligible purchases can be made by the Basic Card Member and any Additional Card Members on a single Card account. Eligible purchases are purchases for goods and services minus returns and other credits. Eligible purchases to meet the spend requirement do NOT include fees or interest charges, cash advances, purchases of traveler's checks, purchases or reloading of prepaid cards, purchases of gift cards, person-to-person payments, or purchases of any cash equivalents. Additional Card Members on your account are not eligible for their own offer. In rare instances, your period to spend $12,000 may be shorter than 6 months if there is a delay in receiving your Card. Also, purchases may fall outside of the 6 month period in some cases, such as a delay in merchants submitting transactions to us or if the purchase date differs from the date you made the transaction. (For example, if you buy goods online, the purchase date may be the date the goods are shipped). This offer is not transferable. If your application is not received by 04/02/2025, we will not process your application even if we later receive your application. American Express reserves the right to modify or revoke offer at any time. \u00a0\u200b\nIf you have a history of cancelling or downgrading American Express Card accounts within your first year and you cancel or downgrade your new Card account within your first year, we may not credit, we may freeze, or we may take away the bonus miles from your account. If we determine that you have engaged in abuse, misuse, or gaming in connection with this offer in any way or that you intend to do so, including if you return purchases you made to meet the Threshold Amount, we may not credit, we may freeze, or we may take away the bonus miles from your account. We may also cancel any accounts you have with us.\u200b\n2\n. \nTakeOff 15\n:\nEligibility\n:\u200b\nBasic Delta SkyMiles Gold, Platinum and Reserve American Express Card Members, as well as Basic Delta SkyMiles Gold, Platinum and Reserve Business American Express Card Members (each, an \u201cEligible Card\u201d), can get at least a fifteen percent (15%) discount off the mileage portion of an Award Ticket (the \u201cTakeOff 15\u201d benefit). Additional Card Members are not eligible. \u200b\nAvailable only if entire itinerary is on Delta and Delta Connection\n\u00ae\n carrier-operated and ticketed flights booked at \ndelta.com \nor the FlyDelta app. Not available on flights operated by other carriers. Not available for Pay with Miles, Miles + Cash, seat upgrades purchased after the initial flight booking, or other Delta products or services. Discount only applies to the mileage portion of the Award Ticket fare and does not apply to applicable taxes and fees which must be paid using the Eligible Card. Card Member must be logged-in to a SkyMiles account linked to an Eligible Card to receive the TakeOff 15 benefit discount. Mileage discount will be greater than or equal to 15% of the overall miles portion for the Award Ticket. An Award Ticket is a ticket issued by Delta pursuant to the SkyMiles Program Rules, by which SkyMiles members may redeem miles and pay applicable government-imposed taxes and fees in exchange for air transportation. All Award Ticket rules apply, as set forth on \ndelta.com\n and in the specific terms incorporated into your Award Ticket. Award Travel is defined as travel using an Award Ticket. Award Travel seats are limited and may not be available on all flights or in all markets.\u200b\nSkyMiles account balance must have sufficient miles for the entire Award Ticket(s) being purchased. TakeOff 15 benefit is not combinable with certificates, Delta eCredits, Delta Gift Cards, vouchers, or with any other discounts or promotional offers.\u00a0\nAward Ticket Taxes/Fees\n:\u200b\nAward Ticket taxes and fees include only U.S. excise and departure/arrival taxes, airport charges, segment fees, the September 11th Security Fee, and international taxes and fees normally included in the Award Ticket. \u200b\nAward Ticket Cancellations and Changes\n:\u200b\nIn the event of a voluntary cancellation of the Award Ticket to which the TakeOff 15 benefit was applied, redeemed miles will be redeposited into the Card Member\u2019s SkyMiles account, except for Basic Economy tickets. Current Award Ticket redeposit fees apply. Basic Economy cancellations will result in cancellation charge assessed in miles, as outlined in fare rules. Remaining miles after deduction of the cancellation charge will be redeposited to Card Member\u2019s SkyMiles account. There is no discount applicable to the cancellation charge. \u00a0\u200b\nIf changing an Award Ticket after ticketing, discount is applied to the new Award Ticket (if eligible), and the difference in miles will be deducted from the Card Member\u2019s SkyMiles account (if the new Award Ticket mileage amount is higher) or redeposited into the Card Member\u2019s SkyMiles account (if the new Award Ticket mileage amount is lower). Basic Economy tickets are not eligible for voluntary changes. SkyMiles Member must be an active Basic Delta SkyMiles, Gold, Platinum or Reserve American Express Card Member or Basic Delta SkyMiles Gold, Platinum or Reserve Business American Express Card Member at time that the Award Ticket is changed to be eligible for the TakeOff 15 benefit on the changed Award Ticket.\u200b\nMiscellaneous\n:\u200b\nAll SkyMiles Program rules apply to SkyMiles Program membership, miles, offers, mile accrual, mile redemption, and travel benefits.

As such, we strive to adhere to the Web Content Accessibility Guidelines (\u201cWCAG\u201d) 2.0 Levels A and AA, a set of guidelines developed by the World Wide Web Consortium and used to ensure that digital content is accessible to everyone. We also work with advocacy groups, accessibility and usability consultants, and persons with disabilities to make sure that our website and mobile applications function properly. We are always learning and looking for ways to improve accessibility. Here are some steps we\u2019ve taken to improve access to our website and mobile applications: Text Equivalents: We provide alternative text detail for appropriate images and other non-text elements. Full Keyboard Access: Our website is built so that it can be accessed using a keyboard. Site Consistency: We are consistent in the way we build our website and mobile applications so that they function the same way every time you interact with them. Site Structure: We use appropriate headings, lists, paragraphs, style sheets and other formatting features so that guests can easily use the website with assistive technology. Links: Many links have title attributes which describe the link in greater detail, unless the text of the link already fully describes the target.If you have any feedback or questions regarding our website....Mixtiles Terms of Service Here\u2019s an overview of our terms. We highly recommend that you read our complete legal information below, because that's the one that really counts. (Plus, who doesn't enjoy reading a good, long Terms of Service now and again?) If you just want the highlights \u2013 or spoilers, as the legal team likes to think of them \u2013 here are a few of the most important bits, in plain English. You still own all the pictures you order from us. You keep the copyright to all of your images. We won\u2019t sell them, share them, or use them for anything other than getting your tiles printed and delivered to you. We need access to your photo gallery to show you your pictures in the Mixtiles app. When you open our app for the first time, it\u2019ll ask you for permission to access your photos. We need that so we can let you select, crop, and order your pics in our app. If you want, you can turn that permission off in your settings later or delete the app to remove the permission. If you want, we\u2019ll delete all your pictures and personal data from our systems. All you need to do is send us an email to from the email address you entered when you made your order. You agree not to order any pictures you don\u2019t own, or any pornography or discriminatory content. There are lots of people involved in the printing process, so we can\u2019t print any images with nudity or offensive content. We also can\u2019t print pictures that you don\u2019t have the right to use. If you do send us a picture that doesn't belong to you and we are sued by the rightful owner, you'll be responsible for all related costs. If there\u2019s a problem with your tiles or if there are any other issues, just send us an email to... or a chat through the app. We\u2019ll do our best to get it all sorted out.In connection with your purchase of a Tile through the Services, you will be asked to provide customary billing information such as name, billing address and credit card information either to Mixtiles or its third-party payment processor(s).

    "subject": "Real Estate Commission Lawsuits \u2013 New Settlements Reached",
    "body": "If you sold a home and paid a commission to a real estate agent, you \nmay\n be a part of class action Settlements \n \nPROPOSED SETTLEMENTS WITH ALL DEFENDANTS TOTAL OVER\n \n$1 BILLION\n \nA federal court authorized this Notice. \nPara una notificaci\u00f3n en espa\u00f1ol, visite \nwww.RealEstateCommissionLitigation.com\n. \nWhat is this lawsuit about? \nThis Notice is to inform you that proposed Settlements have been reached with Keyes, Illustrated, NextHome, John L. Scott, LoKation, Real Estate One, and Baird & Warner in a lawsuit known as \nGibson, et al. v. The National Association of Realtors, et al.\n, Case No. 23-CV-788-SRB (W.D. Mo.) (\"\nGibson\n\") and with Side, Seven Gables, WFP, JPAR, Signature, First Team, Sibcy Cline, Brooklyn MLS, and CNYIS in a lawsuit known as \nKeel, et al. v. Washington Fine Properties LLC, et al.,\n (W.D. Mo. Case No. 4:25-CV-00055-SRB) (\"\nKeel\n\"). The lawsuits allege the existence of an anticompetitive agreement that resulted in home sellers paying inflated commissions to real estate brokers or agents in violation of antitrust law. Proposed Settlements have also been reached with other Defendants in related lawsuits. \nAll Defendants in the lawsuits are listed at \nwww.RealEstateCommissionLitigation.com\n. \nHow do I know if I am a part of the Settlements?\n \nYou are a Settlement Class Member and eligible for payment if you: (1) sold a home during the Eligible Date Range; (2) listed the home that was sold on a multiple listing service (\"MLS\") anywhere in the United States; and (3) paid a commission to any real estate brokerage in connection with the sale of the home. The term \"MLS\" encompasses all NAR and non-NAR MLSs. The Eligible Date Range depends on which state or MLS you listed your home for sale on. Go to \nwww.RealEstateCommissionLitigation.com\n to see the Eligible Date Range and to learn more. \nWhat do the Settlements provide? \nThe \nGibson\n Settling Defendants named here have agreed to pay, collectively, over \n$8 million\n into a Settlement Fund and the \nKeel\n Settling Defendants named here over \n$11.4 million\n. The current value of \nall\n proposed Settlements with these and other Defendants is over \n$1 billion\n. The Fund will be distributed to qualifying Settlement Class Members who submit an approved Claim Form, after any awarded attorneys\u2019 fees, expenses, Settlement Administration costs, and service awards have been deducted. Settling Defendants have also agreed to implement Practice Changes and provide Cooperation. \nYou can learn more about the Practice Changes and Cooperation in the Settlement Agreements, available at \nwww.RealEstateCommissionLitigation.com\n. \nHow do I get a payment? \nNote: If you have already submitted a Claim Form in this case for a prior Settlement with other Defendants, you do not need to submit another Claim. \nYou must submit a Claim Form with information pertaining to and/or evidence of your home sale and commissions paid, by \nMay 9, 2025\n. Claim Forms can be submitted online at \nwww.RealEstateCommissionLitigation.com\n. \nYou can also print a Claim Form at the website and mail it to Real Estate Commission Litigation Settlements, c/o JND Legal Administration, PO Box 91479, Seattle, WA 98111, or email it to \ninfo@RealEstateCommissionLitigation.com\n. \nWhat are my other options? \nYou may object to or exclude yourself (opt-out) from the Settlements by \nMay 9, 2025\n, or do nothing. If you \nexclude yourself\n, you will \nnot\n receive a Settlement Payment, but this is the only option that allows you to sue the Settling Defendants named here, and their Released Parties, relating to commission prices. If you wish to \nobject\n, the Court will consider your views in deciding whether to approve or reject the proposed Settlements. If the Court does not approve the Settlements, no Settlement Payments will be sent, and the lawsuit will continue. You cannot object if you opt-out. By \ndoing nothing\n, you will get no payment, and you will not be able to sue the Settling Defendants relating to commission prices. \nFor more information, including how to object or exclude yourself and to read the full terms of the release, visit \nwww.RealEstateCommissionLitigation.com\n. \nWhat happens next? \nThe Court will hold a hearing on \nJune 24, 2025\n to consider whether to grant Final Approval of the Settlements and award fees and costs to the attorneys representing the class (\u201cClass Counsel\u201d). The Court has appointed the law firms of Ketchmark and McCreight; Williams Dirks Dameron; Boulware Law; Hagens Berman Sobol Shapiro; Cohen Milstein Sellers & Toll; and Susman Godfrey as Class Counsel. Class Counsel will ask the Court to award an amount not to exceed one-third (33.3%) of the Settlement Funds, plus out-of-pocket expenses incurred during the case. The Court may award less. Class Counsel will also seek compensation for each current and/or former Class Representative. You will be represented by Class Counsel at the hearing unless you choose to enter an appearance in person or through your own lawyer, at your own cost, or unless you choose to object or opt-out of the Settlements. The appearance of your own attorney is not necessary to participate in the hearing. \nQuestions? \nThis Notice is only a summary. To learn more, visit \nwww.RealEstateCommissionLitigation.com\n, call toll-free \n888-995-0207\n, email \ninfo@RealEstateCommissionLitigation.com\n, or write Real Estate Commission Litigation Settlements, c/o JND Legal Administration, PO Box 91479, Seattle, WA 98111. \nTo unsubscribe from this list, please click on the following link: \nunsubscribe",

When icy missions called, Bond relied on Q's genius modifications to his classic cars, like his winterized Aston Martin V8 with ski-like outriggers and studded tires used in 1987\u2019s \nThe Living Daylights\n. These studs act like cleats for snow, breaking through packed ice to provide better control. The V8's outriggers, replicating ice skates, are perfect for sliding and leaping over frozen terrain.\nScientists believe that the pressure of skates pushing into ice is constantly creating a liquid-solid mix, which reduces the friction and allows the skater to slide, turn and stop. This principle inspired Bond's epic frozen lake escape in his V8. \u00a0\nDon\u2019t miss your chance to see the V8 up close and explore more science behind the gadgets and stunts in the Bond franchise in \n007 Science: Inventing the World of James Bond\n \u2013 closing April 6.\nLearn More About 007 Science\n \n\u00a0 \n\u00a0 \n \n\u00a0 \n\u00a0 \n\u00a0 \n\u00a0 \n\u00a0\n\u00a0 \n \n \n \n \n \n\u00a0 \nGriffin Museum of Science and Industry \n5700 S.

As such, we strive to adhere to the Web Content Accessibility Guidelines (\u201cWCAG\u201d) 2.0 Levels A and AA, a set of guidelines developed by the World Wide Web Consortium and used to ensure that digital content is accessible to everyone. We also work with advocacy groups, accessibility and usability consultants, and persons with disabilities to make sure that our website and mobile applications function properly. We are always learning and looking for ways to improve accessibility. Here are some steps we\u2019ve taken to improve access to our website and mobile applications: Text Equivalents: We provide alternative text detail for appropriate images and other non-text elements. Full Keyboard Access: Our website is built so that it can be accessed using a keyboard. Site Consistency: We are consistent in the way we build our website and mobile applications so that they function the same way every time you interact with them. Site Structure: We use appropriate headings, lists, paragraphs, style sheets and other formatting features so that guests can easily use the website with assistive technology. Links: Many links have title attributes which describe the link in greater detail, unless the text of the link already fully describes the target.If you have any feedback or questions regarding our website....Mixtiles Terms of Service Here\u2019s an overview of our terms. We highly recommend that you read our complete legal information below, because that's the one that really counts. (Plus, who doesn't enjoy reading a good, long Terms of Service now and again?) If you just want the highlights \u2013 or spoilers, as the legal team likes to think of them \u2013 here are a few of the most important bits, in plain English. You still own all the pictures you order from us. You keep the copyright to all of your images. We won\u2019t sell them, share them, or use them for anything other than getting your tiles printed and delivered to you. We need access to your photo gallery to show you your pictures in the Mixtiles app. When you open our app for the first time, it\u2019ll ask you for permission to access your photos. We need that so we can let you select, crop, and order your pics in our app. If you want, you can turn that permission off in your settings later or delete the app to remove the permission. If you want, we\u2019ll delete all your pictures and personal data from our systems. All you need to do is send us an email to from the email address you entered when you made your order. You agree not to order any pictures you don\u2019t own, or any pornography or discriminatory content. There are lots of people involved in the printing process, so we can\u2019t print any images with nudity or offensive content. We also can\u2019t print pictures that you don\u2019t have the right to use. If you do send us a picture that doesn't belong to you and we are sued by the rightful owner, you'll be responsible for all related costs. If there\u2019s a problem with your tiles or if there are any other issues, just send us an email to... or a chat through the app. We\u2019ll do our best to get it all sorted out.In connection with your purchase of a Tile through the Services, you will be asked to provide customary billing information such as name, billing address and credit card information either to Mixtiles or its third-party payment processor(s). You agree to pay Mixtiles the Fee as set forth in the App during the purchase process for any confirmed transactions made in connection with your account in accordance with these Terms by one of the methods described on the App. You hereby authorize the collection of such amounts by charging the credit card provided, either directly by Mixtiles or indirectly, via a third-party online payment processor or by one of the payment methods described on the App. If you are directed to a third-party payment processor(s), you may be subject to terms and conditions governing use of that third party's service and that third party's Personal Data collection practices.

    "body": "Plus, shedding light on a promised immersive exhibit at Navy Pier. Here\u2019s what you need to know today.\n \n.\nTo view this email as a web page, click \nhere.\nFriday - March 28, 2025\nToday's \nRundown\n is brought to you by WBEZ members\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\nby Bianca Cseke\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\nGood afternoon! It\u2019s Friday, and the only perk of having jetlag all week was watching last night\u2019s \nlightning\n. Here\u2019s what you need to know today.\n\u00a0 \n1.\nThe CTU and CPS have a potential contract deal, sources say\n\u00a0\nLeaders of the Chicago Teachers Union and Chicago Public Schools have reached a possible agreement that will go to a union committee for approval on Monday, my colleagues Sarah Karp and Nader Issa report.\nA settlement had been within reach for a couple weeks, and a final few days of talks this week \u2014 including a late-night session on Wednesday \u2014 helped the two sides reach the finish line. If the terms are approved, this will bring an end to almost a year of tense negotiations.\nCTU leaders plan to take the proposed package to their \u201cbig bargaining team\u201d \u2014 a group of a couple dozen educators who have helped negotiate the contract \u2014 for approval. That team will decide whether to recommend the package to the union\u2019s 730-member House of Delegates. A final ratification vote by the CTU\u2019s 30,000 members would seal the deal.\nThis would be the first time the CTU has landed a contract without a strike vote in the 15 years under the union\u2019s current leadership.\nThe union ultimately decided to accept the salary offer put forward in the summer of 4% cost-of-living increases in each of the four years of the contract. The district also promised to hire 30 librarians over each of the next three years.\u00a0\n[\nWBEZ/Chicago Sun-Times\n]\n2.\nSixteen new speed cameras are being installed near Chicago schools and parks\n\u00a0\nSpeed cameras installed at 16 new locations will begin doling out warning notices on April Fool\u2019s Day, but it\u2019s no joke, my colleague Fran Spielman reports.\nTicketing for motorists driving too fast near schools and parks will begin on May 15. That\u2019s after a 30-day warning period, followed by a two-week \u201cblack-out period\u201d to make certain drivers receive any warning in the mail before citations are issued.\nNear schools, enforcement hours are between 7 a.m. and 7 p.m. Monday through Friday on school days. The speed limit is 20 mph when children are present and the posted speed limit when no children are present.\nCameras installed near parks will trigger warning notices and tickets when each park is open, which is normally 6 a.m. to 11 p.m. seven days a week.\nThe 16 cameras are the first of 50 that Mayor Brandon Johnson vowed to install to generate $11.4 million in 2025 \u2014 part of the compromise plan to balance his narrowly approved 2025 budget after the City Council balked at raising property taxes. You can see the full list of locations in the link.

His administration has been accused by civil rights advocates of disobeying a court order that sought to halt the deportation flights.\nIn Chicago, where gangs have long been the targets of sweeping federal investigations, police sources told the Chicago Sun-Times that Tren de Aragua\u2019s operations and reach aren\u2019t clear.\nAlmost all the 37 men flagged by Chicago police as possible members have faced only drug charges and citations for driving infractions, my colleagues Tom Schuba, Frank Main and Elvia Malag\u00f3n report.\nMany of the men are from Venezuela, where the prison gang started, or Colombia, Honduras and Ecuador \u2014 countries where the gang reportedly has spread. Police have used the men\u2019s tattoos, clothing and a car decal to link them to the gang, citing law enforcement alerts detailing its iconography. Arrest reports reviewed by the Sun-Times show only one man whose tattoo is considered a symbol of the gang.\nFederal officials have connected two reputed Tren de Aragua members to high-profile shootings in Chicago, but they haven\u2019t been charged in the attacks. [\nChicago Sun-Times\n]\n4.\nThe transformation of a historic Loop office building into housing has begun\n\u00a0\nThe 14-story building at 79 W. Monroe St. is part of the city\u2019s La Salle Corridor Revitalization initiative, bringing more than 1,000 new apartments to the Loop after the pandemic hiked office vacancy levels, my colleague Abby Miller reports for the Chicago Sun-Times.\nThe property \u2014 formerly known as the Bell Federal Savings & Loan Building, now called the Rector Building \u2014 was built in 1905. It\u2019s the oldest surviving commercial tower designed by architect Jarvis Hunt. The building was also given landmark status by the Chicago City Council on March 12.\nOnce completed, the residential tower will offer 117 units, including 41 affordable. Floors seven through 13 will include apartments, according to Housing Department Commissioner Lissette Castaneda. The lower floors are currently occupied by a charter school and a Walgreens. [\nChicago Sun-Times\n]\n5.\nNavy Pier claims a bait and switch on an immersive exhibit at Crystal Gardens\n\u00a0\nThe owners of Navy Pier say entertainment company Illuminarium broke its promise to build a $30 million \u201cstate of the art\u201d immersive sensory experience and instead created a \u201crun-of-the-mill virtual reality exhibit,\u201d Kade Heather reports for the Chicago Sun-Times.\nIn 2021, Illuminarium entered a 10-year lease agreement with NPI, the nonprofit that operates Navy Pier, to build what it described as a \u201ccutting edge immersive experience unlike anything most people have ever experienced,\u201d according to a lawsuit filed by NPI last week in Cook County circuit court.\nBut after the lease agreement, Illuminarium said its finances had worsened because of the pandemic and it would need to raise money to create the larger attraction. In January, Illuminarium allegedly told Navy Pier operators it decided to use Crystal Gardens for a walk-around virtual reality experience, rather than its initial proposal.\n\u201cMost certainly, NPI did not agree, and would never have agreed, to commit the iconic Crystal Garden to Illuminarium for a period of at least ten years if Illuminarium intended to use the space for a virtual reality exhibit,\u201d the suit says. [\nChicago Sun-Times\n]\n\u00a0\nHere's what else is happening\n\u00a0\nA major earthquake killed at least 150 people and injured hundreds more in Myanmar and Thailand. [\nNPR\n]\nTwo major law firms, including Chicago-based Jenner & Block, sued the Trump administration over executive orders targeting them. [\nNPR\n]\nThe biggest reveals in a new Yoko Ono biography include her mental health struggles and John Lennon's infidelity. [\nUSA Today\n]\nLongtime DePaul women's basketball coach Doug Bruno announced his retirement. [\nAP\n]\n\u00a0\nOh, and one more thing...\n\u00a0\nChicago-based singer and songwriter Isabel Olive released her third album today.\nIn \nCosmovisi\u00f3n\n, the Venezuelan American singer known as Half Gringa deploys complex melodies and ruminative lyrics to explore themes like climate change and her dual heritage.\nShe spoke to WBEZ\u2019s Mary Dixon before a recent performance at our studios; you can listen to the interview and read highlights in the link, including Olive\u2019s desire to give migrants and their children hope through her music. [\nWBEZ\n]\n\u00a0\nTell me something good\n\u00a0\nI was just in India and saw the Taj Mahal, and it absolutely lived up to the hype as one of the most beautiful buildings in the world. That has me wondering, what\u2019s something that left you in awe while traveling, whether it\u2019s an iconic landmark or a unique experience?\nRich writes:\n\u201cThe forest of Giant Sequoias in California\u2019s Kings Canyon NP. I felt so small hiking alone early one morning under their 30-storey canopies, and so insignificant facing these 3000 year-old testaments to Nature\u2019s endurance. I cried tears of joy to be among them.\u201d\nJen writes:\n\u201cSeeing the great migration of Sandhill Cranes through Central Nebraska always fills me with awe! It is absolutely gorgeous to see the spectacle of these birds returning to the Platte River at dusk or flying off in search of food at dawn. I am so grateful to be in Nebraska now to see some of the about 700,000 cranes currently in the area. Sandhill Cranes have been flying through this part of the world for over 2 million years. In that time, so much has changed, but the cranes have been resilient and adapted along the way. Seeing the crane migration gives me so much hope and helps me connect to the people around me and the larger natural world.\u201d\nAnd Ed writes:\n\u201cI would have to go with the Gaudi architectural sites in Barcelona. We saw La Sagrada Familia and Parc Guell in the same afternoon. The former is rightfully lauded for its majesty and intricate architectural features, but the latter \u2014 while not as grand \u2014 was even more aggressive. The bright colors and swirling shapes of the buildings, gardens and plazas dotting this one-time estate made me feel like I was walking through the board of the children\u2019s game Candy Land.\u201d\nThanks for all the responses this week! I could only publish a handful of them, but it was great hearing about your experiences and adding to my bucket list.\nThanks for reading and have a nice weekend! I'll see you on Monday.\n\u2014 Bianca Cseke\nThe Rundown is reader-funded.\u00a0\nYour gift of any amount helps power this newsletter and all of WBEZ\u2019s reporting.\u00a0\nDONATE TODAY\n\u00a9Chicago Public Media Inc 848 East Grand Ave, Navy Pier Chicago, IL 60611\nUnsubscribe\u00a0from The Daily Rundown\n\u00a0| \nPrivacy Policy",

Here\u2019s what you need to know today.\n \n.\nTo view this email as a web page, click \nhere.\nThursday - March 27, 2025\nToday's \nRundown\n is brought to you by WBEZ members and\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\nby Bianca Cseke\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\nGood afternoon! It\u2019s Thursday \u2014 and Opening Day for the \nWhite Sox\n and \nCubs\n. Here\u2019s what else you need to know today.\n\u00a0 \n1.\nThe Trump administration cut $153 million in Illinois public health and substance abuse programs\n\u00a0\nThe cuts are part of $12 billion in grants the federal \nDepartment of Health and Human Services\n canceled across the country this week, citing the end of the COVID-19 pandemic, my colleagues Tina Sfondeles and Mitchell Armentrout report.\nState officials said they learned this week of $28 million in previously approved grants that have been slashed from the Illinois Department of Human Services, while $125 million has been pulled back from the state Department of Public Health.\nThe Trump administration is also blocking another $324 million in future public health department grants Illinois had been set to receive under the CARES Act, passed by Congress during Trump\u2019s first term in the early days of the COVID-19 pandemic.\n\u201cIf allowed to stand, this funding cut will set back critical upgrades to our public health labs, technology used to track infectious diseases like H5N1 avian flu and measles, vaccination efforts and our ongoing work to better prepare for the next public health emergency,\u201d IDPH Director Dr. Sameer Vohra said.\nThe money also helped support behavioral health crisis responses, substance abuse recovery homes and prevention services, and assistance for people experiencing early symptoms of psychosis. [\nChicago Sun-Times\n]\n2.\nA DePaul class inside Cook County Jail brings together incarcerated and traditional students\n\u00a0\nInside-Out is a program taught in hundreds of jails and prisons across the country, and its DePaul University class this quarter is about homelessness, WBEZ contributor Charlotte West reports.\n\u201cThere are deeply embedded societal beliefs about unhoused neighbors, just as there are assumptions about people impacted by the carceral system,\u201d said Jen Kouba, an adjunct professor of peace, justice and conflict studies. \u201cAnd the inside students are the first to acknowledge that they had assumptions about me and the outside DePaul students.\u201d\nMolly, an outside student in the group and a journalism major, said she often talks about issues like homelessness and the prison system at school, but those often feel separate from students\u2019 reality on campus.\nTaking a class at the jail has made those topics much more real. As a future journalist, \u201cbeing able to talk to people from so many different backgrounds is really helpful,\u201d Molly said. [\nWBEZ\n]\nSPONSOR MESSAGE FROM WOODLANDS ACADEMY\nWe Are Woodlands Academy: Girls Thrive Here\nWoodlands Academy of the Sacred Heart\n\u2014a Catholic, independent, college-preparatory day and boarding high school for girls\u2014consistently ranks as the \n#1 all-girls high school in Illinois.\nWith a 100% focus on the education, development, and well-being of young women, Woodlands is inspiring the next generation of leaders.\nWoodlands Academy is now accepting applications for the 2025-2026 school year. Visit \nwoodlandsacademy.org.\n3.\nChicago will waive late fees and back charges on vehicle stickers next month\n\u00a0\nAs part of the Office of the City Clerk\u2019s Amnesty Month, residents will be able to buy stickers for their motorbikes, cars and trucks without late fees or back charges, Block Club Chicago reports.\nLate fees for vehicle stickers or renewals are usually $60, or $30 for qualified seniors. Chicagoans are required to purchase stickers within 30 days of moving to the city if they own a vehicle or within 30 days of buying one.\nThis year\u2019s annual stickers cost $53.04 for motorbikes, $100.17 to $159.12 for passenger vehicles and $235.71 to $530.40 for trucks. [\nBlock Club Chicago\n]\nHere\u2019s a list of all locations where you can purchase a sticker. [\nOffice of the City Clerk\n]\n4.\nChicago cops get dressed down over their sloppy appearance\n\u00a0\nChicago Police Department leaders are cracking down on the appearance of some district officers who could face reprimands, according to an internal email sent out this week by a police leader and obtained by my Chicago Sun-Times colleagues.\nSupervisors and officers were told to shave their stubble, wear neutral nail polish colors and avoid \u201cfaddish\u201d haircuts. Those out of step were threatened with discipline.\n\u201cThe department has had appearance standards forever,\u201d said John Catanzara, president of the Fraternal Order of Police Chicago Lodge 7. \u201cThe superintendent [Larry Snelling] made it very clear that was going to be one of his main motivations or focuses coming in.\u201d [\nChicago Sun-Times\n]\n5.\nFuture, Young Thug, Don Toliver and Yeat will headline Lyrical Lemonade\u2019s Summer Smash Festival\n\u00a0\nOther performers set for the three-day weekend, which runs June 20\u201322 at Bridgeview\u2019s SeatGeek Stadium, include Sexyy Red, Lil Yachty, Soulja Boy and Quavo.\nThe festival, one of hip-hop\u2019s largest showcases, also spotlights Chicago hometown heroes G Herbo, Saba, Famous Dex and Chance The Rapper.\nTickets and parking passes go on sale at noon tomorrow at \nthesummersmash.com\n and the DICE mobile app. Installment payment options are also available. Single-day ticket sales will be announced at a later date. [\nChicago Sun-Times\n]\n\u00a0\nHere's what else is happening\n\u00a0\nPresident Donald Trump placed a 25% tariff on imported vehicles, expecting to raise $100 billion in tax revenues but worrying automakers who rely on global supply chains. [\nAP\n]\nAt least six people died after a submarine carrying tourists on a reef tour in the Red Sea sank off Egypt\u2019s coast. [\nAP\n]\nIllinois Sen. Dick Durbin is under fire from progressives over voting for the GOP spending plan. [\nChicago Sun-Times\n]\nChicago immigrant advocates blasted a leaked draft of the Trump administration\u2019s travel ban. [\nChicago Sun-Times\n]\n\u00a0\nOh, and one more thing...\n\u00a0\nChicago indie band Free Range\u2019s forthcoming second album explores themes of growing up, all while showcasing a band maturing into form, WBEZ contributor Andrew Meriwether writes.\nLost & Found\n, out tomorrow on Mick Music, comes a little over a year after \nPractice\n, Free Range\u2019s first full-length record.\nPractice \nwas created in bits and pieces, in a very DIY fashion. Much was done in apartments or basements, with bandmates Jack Henry and Sofia Jensen learning how to record and mix as they went. The effort took two and half years.\nThe creation of \nLost & Found\n couldn\u2019t have been more different. Free Range partnered with musician and producer Tommy Reed, who runs a studio called Lazy Bones in rural Silsbee, Texas. That focused creative period was integral not only to the quality of the recordings but also formation of a band identity. [\nWBEZ\n]\n\u00a0\nTell me something good\n\u00a0\nI was just in India and saw the Taj Mahal, and it absolutely lived up to the hype as one of the most beautiful buildings in the world. That has me wondering, what\u2019s something that left you in awe while traveling, whether it\u2019s an iconic landmark or a unique experience?\nJonathan writes:\n\u201cIguazu Falls at the Argentine-Brazilian border. Immortalized in the 1986 film, The Mission (which has an amazing soundtrack), the real thing was even more amazing.\u201d\nSandra writes:\n\u201cOne of the most amazing sites I visited was the Cistern in Istanbul, surprising mostly because I was just not expecting a cistern to be an amazing site. It was an example of ancient Roman engineering, with giant columns with huge upside-down Medusa heads at the bases. Why they thought to put beautifully carved columns at the bottom of a cistern is beyond me. Perhaps they knew that in a couple thousand years, it would no longer serve as a water source, and would be an incredible tourist attraction, complete with a light-and-sound exhibit and a small cafe.\u201d\nAnd Tony writes:\n\u201cOne of the only times I had my breath taken away was the first time I saw Flamenco beach on the island of Culebra, part of PR. Friends moved there from Chicago and the first time I visited they had to show me one of the reasons why they would sell all their belongings and leave a 2 bedroom in Ravenswood to a Caribbean island. I am not a beach person but when I walked up and saw the view, I literally had my breath taken away.\u201d\nFeel free to email me, and your response may be included in the newsletter this week.\nThanks for reading and have a nice night! I'll see you tomorrow.\n\u2014 Bianca Cseke\nThe Rundown is reader-funded.\u00a0\nYour gift of any amount helps power this newsletter and all of WBEZ\u2019s reporting.\u00a0\nDONATE TODAY\n\u00a9Chicago Public Media Inc 848 East Grand Ave, Navy Pier Chicago, IL 60611\nUnsubscribe\u00a0from The Daily Rundown\n\u00a0| \nPrivacy Policy",

This authenticity fosters both professional collaboration and personal connection, challenging the assumption that in-person work is necessary for strong workplace bonds.\nWhile companies argue that physical proximity drives creativity and collaboration, many employees remain resistant, citing better work-life balance, increased productivity, and reduced stress when working remotely. Experts suggest that RTO policies should be task-based, allowing flexibility where possible rather than enforcing blanket mandates.\nDr. Gleb\u2019s Take\nThe data is clear: forcing employees back to the office under the illusion that it strengthens relationships is a leadership failure. Authentic connections aren\u2019t built in conference rooms\u2014they\u2019re built through trust, autonomy, and respect. This study proves that remote work doesn\u2019t weaken relationships; it makes them more human.\nCompanies clinging to outdated in-office models aren\u2019t promoting collaboration\u2014they\u2019re asserting control. The future of work is hybrid, flexible, and results-driven. Businesses that embrace this will thrive. Those that don\u2019t will bleed talent to smarter competitors.\n\u201c\nLocal Heterogeneity in Artificial Intelligence Jobs Over Time and Space\n\u201d (SSRN)\nSummary\nThis study analyzes how AI-related job opportunities have evolved across U.S. counties between 2014 and 2023. While traditional tech hubs like Santa Clara, CA, remain dominant, surprising growth has emerged in suburban and remote-friendly areas such as Maries, MO, and Hughes, SD\u2014particularly in the post-lockdown era.\nKey factors driving AI job adoption include a higher concentration of STEM graduates, a tight labor market, and strong patent activity. Conversely, regions with heavy manufacturing and high employee turnover see slower AI adoption. The findings highlight how AI\u2019s economic benefits are unevenly distributed, emphasizing the role of local education, innovation, and labor market conditions. The paper also suggests that place-based policies could help attract AI talent and investments, reducing regional disparities.\nDr. Gleb\u2019s Take\nThe AI job market isn\u2019t just about Silicon Valley anymore\u2014it\u2019s decentralizing, and fast. This study confirms that suburban and remote-friendly regions are becoming unexpected winners in AI job growth. The message for policymakers is clear: if you want to compete in the AI economy, invest in STEM education and innovation incentives now, and support remote work.\nManufacturing-heavy regions resisting AI adoption and opposing remote work are setting themselves up for long-term economic decline. The future belongs to remote-friendly areas that embrace AI, not just as a tool, but as a driver of regional economic transformation. Place-based policies aren\u2019t optional; they\u2019re a necessity for staying competitive in the AI-driven world.\n\u201c\nWhat\u2019s the Goal of the Goal?\n\u201d (Behavioral Scientist)\nSummary\nThis article explores how focusing on short-term metrics can sometimes undermine an organization\u2019s true mission. It illustrates this with several examples, including a car dealership aggressively pressuring customers for high satisfaction scores\u2014so much so that it turned a positive buying experience into a frustrating ordeal. The dealership\u2019s goal should have been to improve customer satisfaction, but instead, they prioritized gaming the rating system.\nAnother example involves Eurostar\u2019s decision to spend 6 billion GBP to cut travel time between London and Paris by 20 minutes. While this technically met their goal, it ignored the bigger question: was this the best way to improve passenger experience? Alternatives like Wi-Fi or enhanced service could have been cheaper and more effective.\nThe article also discusses a government program to help disabled veterans get student loan forgiveness. Initially, the goal was to increase application rates, but after stepping back and asking \u201cWhat\u2019s the goal of the goal?\u201d officials realized they could eliminate the application process altogether\u2014dramatically improving efficiency and veterans\u2019 financial security.\nUltimately, the piece argues that before pursuing any goal, leaders should ask: \u201cWhat\u2019s the bigger purpose?\u201d This approach can prevent wasted effort and uncover simpler, more impactful solutions.\nDr. Gleb\u2019s Take\nThis article nails a fundamental leadership failure: chasing arbitrary metrics instead of real impact. Too many organizations mistake numbers for progress, blindly optimizing for a flawed target. Whether it\u2019s forcing customers into fake high ratings, spending billions on unnecessary upgrades, or drowning people in bureaucracy, the pattern is the same\u2014losing sight of the actual mission.\nSmart leaders step back and ask, \u201cWhat are we really trying to achieve?\u201d Those who don\u2019t end up wasting resources, frustrating employees, and missing out on better solutions. If your strategy is just hitting numbers instead of delivering real value, you\u2019re not leading\u2014you\u2019re just checking boxes.\nWhat did you think of my take on these articles?

    "body": "Progress is always possible.\n \n\u00a0\n \nIssue 01\u00a0 |\u00a0 \u00a0\nView\u00a0in browser\n\u00a0 |\u00a0\u00a0\nSubscribe\n \nAt a time when there are so many challenges to social progress, Pivotal will be spotlighting those who are driving progress and the opportunities to accelerate change even further.\nA Note From Our President\nI\u2019ve been thinking about the fall of the Berlin Wall.\u00a0\nToday, most people look back on that historic event and see it as inevitable. But at the time, most experts out there said it was impossible: German reunification would never happen, the Cold War would never end, and the wall would never come down.\u00a0\nAnd those experts were right every single day. Until the day they weren\u2019t.\u00a0\u00a0\nSuddenly, the impossible became possible.\u00a0\u00a0\nOver the past 35 years, I\u2019ve often thought of the Berlin Wall when someone says that change will never come. And today, when so many of us who work on social progress see our work being challenged, it can feel like the barriers to equality and opportunity will never come down. But I firmly believe they will.\u00a0\nAs the president of Pivotal Ventures, I have the privilege of seeing firsthand \nhow our partners are chipping away at those barriers every day\n\u2014and hearing about their efforts always energizes me for the work ahead. In that spirit, we\u2019re introducing a new email series called The Digest, where we\u2019ll highlight those who are driving progress and the opportunities to accelerate change even further.\u00a0\u00a0\nThe future we seek may not happen overnight, but I know that the impossible can become possible. I\u2019ve seen it.\u00a0\n\u2013\n Brooke D. Anderson\nWomen's Political Power\nWave of women reps changes the face of power in states\n \nThe Center for American Women and Politics recently released its \u201cWomen in State Legislatures 2025\u201d report, and the trends point clearly in the direction of growing women\u2019s political power. When CAWP started counting in 1980, just over 10 percent of state reps were women. The proportion didn\u2019t cross the one-quarter mark until 2017. In 2025, it passed the one-third threshold. Next stop\u2026 50 percent!\n\u00a0 \nRead \nThe Report\n\u00a0\u00a0\nHealth of Women and Families\nOpen call reveals rich universe of ideas to improve women\u2019s health\n \nLast fall, in partnership with Lever for Change, Pivotal Philanthropies Foundation launched Action for Women\u2019s Health, a $250 million open call to fund organizations focused on women\u2019s mental and physical health. All told, the open call yielded proposals from organizations spanning 124 countries and six continents, and we couldn\u2019t be more excited by their ideas.\u00a0\u00a0\n\u00a0 \nLearn More\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\nWomen's Economic Power\nWomen investors seize new opportunities in venture capital\n \nWomen are still dramatically underrepresented in the VC industry, but female fund managers are proving every day why underrepresented perspectives are so desperately needed: They see opportunities that others tend to miss. Here\u2019s what five trailblazing investors and Pivotal Ventures partners had to say about the innovations that excite them in 2025, from an AI-powered revolution in productivity to digital healthcare with a human touch.\u00a0\n\u00a0 \nThe Trends Shaping 2025\n\u00a0 \u00a0\nFounder Update\nConnect with our founder, Melinda French Gates\n \nIn honor of International Women\u2019s Day and Women\u2019s History Month, Melinda sat down with LinkedIn to talk about career growth and women in leadership. Not only did she share some of her personal experiences navigating career transitions, but she also offered advice for others. \nCheck it out here.\n \n\u00a0\n \nMelinda\u2019s new book, The Next Day, comes out on April 15. She\u2019ll be traveling to six cities across the U.S. to share personal insights about the book, her experience writing it, and what she hopes readers will take away from it. Learn more about the \nbook tour \nhere\n.\n \n\u00a0\nPivotal is a group of organizations founded by Melinda French Gates in 2015. We work to accelerate the pace of social progress using high-impact investments, philanthropy, partnerships, and advocacy to get more power in the hands of more people\u2014especially women\u2014in the U.S. and around the world.

[[READ MORE]\n \n \nCLIENT ALERT \nFinCEN Limits Scope of Corporate Transparency Act to Foreign Reporting Companies\nClick to Download Corporate Transparency Act Disclosure Form\n \n \nTo: \u00a0Clients and Friends of Fox Swibel Levin & Carroll LLP\nOn March 21, 2025, the Financial Crimes Enforcement Network (FinCEN) published an interim final rule that exempts all entities created in the United States \u2014 including those previously known as \u201cdomestic reporting companies\u201d \u2014 and their beneficial owners from the requirement to report beneficial ownership information to FinCEN. This effectively eliminates reporting requirements for the vast majority of those previously qualified as \u201creporting companies.\u201d\n\u00a0\nReporting obligations still apply to foreign reporting companies \u2013 legal entities formed under the law of a foreign country that have registered to do business in any U.S. State by the filing of a document with a secretary of state or any similar office of a U.S. State. However, the rules provides that foreign reporting companies, and their U.S. person beneficial owners, are exempt from the requirement to provide the BOI of any U.S. persons who are beneficial owners of the foreign reporting company. Existing foreign companies that must report their beneficial ownership information now have an additional 30 days from the date of publication of the interim final rule to file.\n\u00a0\nFinCEN will accept comments on the interim final rule for 60 days and intends to issue a final rule this year. Fox Swibel will continue to monitor updates on CTA enforcement.

This executive order requires that all routine commercial goods and services be consolidated under the General Services Administration (GSA). Federal agencies now have 60 days to transition their acquisitions to the GSA or submit a comprehensive plan outlining their strategy for GSA-based procurement. As part of this significant overhaul, agencies will lose the ability to use previous contracts for these purchases.\nGSA Schedule System Set to Quadruple\nThis initiative is set to dramatically expand the GSA Schedule System. Josh Gruenbaum, head of GSA\u2019s Federal Acquisition Services, announced that the GSA aims to encompass approximately $400 billion in domestic commercial goods and services, effectively quadrupling its current size. \u201cOver the coming months, we are going to absorb all domestic commercial goods and services into the GSA,\u201d Gruenbaum stated. \u201cWhile we\u2019re not targeting the entire $900 billion market, we will bring on about $400 billion\u2014this will definitely quadruple our size.\u201d\nA Rush to Secure GSA Schedules, Particularly in IT\nThe executive order also indicates a substantial shift in IT procurement. The GSA is poised to take on a larger share of federal IT contracts, including existing Government-Wide Acquisition Contracts (GWACs). While the future use of existing contracts remains uncertain, it is anticipated that organizations with GSA Schedules will have a distinct advantage in securing upcoming opportunities. As the GSA's IT footprint expands, a surge of IT companies is likely to compete to secure a place on the GSA Schedule\u2014a process that typically takes 6 to 7 months.\nCentralization: The Future of IT Spending?\nThe outlook for federal IT spending suggests further centralization under the GSA. As procurement consolidates, firms eager to remain competitive for federal contracts will need to either obtain a GSA Schedule or devise a clear plan to do so. This shift will influence everything from contracting vehicles to the competitive landscape within federal IT.\nOur Perspective\nWith over 20 years of experience in federal contracting\u2014particularly with GSA Schedules\u2014we have never witnessed such a sweeping transformation with such far-reaching implications. This change represents a critical juncture for companies holding existing federal contracts, especially in IT and services. It is imperative for organizations to act swiftly to navigate the centralization of federal IT contracts and maintain their competitiveness in this evolving marketplace.\nEmily Hatchel\n859-360-0909\nwww.advancegsa.com\nAdvance GSA\n10500 Norbotten Dr\nFlorence Kentucky 41042\nUnited States \nYou are subscribed to this email as monica@lcwmail.com.\nClick here to modify your \npreferences\n or \nunsubscribe\n.",

    "body": "Musings and Meditations on Mindfulness\n \n \nMarch 2025\nWelcome to Issue No. 13 of MindTaming!\n\u200a\n \n \nOn My Mind:\n \nStaying Calm in the Turmoil\n \n\u201cWe don\u2019t have the luxury of despair.\u201d \u2013 U.S. Senator Jon Ossoff\nDear Friends,\nThis issue of \u201cMindTaming\u201d marks the beginning of year 4 of this blog focused on mindfulness practices, tools and resources. It seems that this type of practice is helpful to more and more people all around me. The mailing list for my Wednesday meditation group is growing every week. (For more information about this group and how to join, see the Community section below.)\nMeditation and mindfulness practices are one way to keep ourselves centered and grounded amid the chaos, uncertainty and constant change all around us, no matter where we stand politically. There are many other ways. We just can\u2019t give up \u2013 or in.\u00a0\nMaintaining a positive inner state, growing our resiliency, staying calm, getting rest and relying on our resources are all things we must do right now. Why? So that we can be our best selves, offer calm and peace to others and take action that aligns with our values and circumstances. As a white, well-educated, middle-class female, I can do a lot of things IF I take care of myself and my loved ones.\u00a0\u00a0\nWhen so many things around me seem out of my control, it\u2019s useful to focus on what I CAN control. My inner state and my physical well-being are things I do have control over. And they impact the way I show up in the world and the kind of behaviors I display.\u00a0\u00a0\nHere are a few things I have found helpful in these trying times:\nKeep things simple and don\u2019t aim for perfection\n. \nNot meeting every single deadline is ok \u2013 just let people know you\u2019re going to be late.\u00a0\n \nRealize that things take time\n. \nDon\u2019t expect immediate results and settle in for the long haul.\n \nDon\u2019t give up hope\n. \n\u201cHope is a discipline, a practice and a commitment,\u201d says American educator and activist Mariame Kaba. Follow her advice.\n \nPractice the 4 Cs\n. \nCommunity, Compassion, Curiosity and Courage.\u00a0\n \nHave fun and do joyful things\n. \n\u201cJoy is an act of resistance,\u201d declares poet Toy Derricotte in her poem \u201cThe Telly Cycle.\u201d\n \nFinally, be gentle with yourself. Try things out and experiment. Reverse course if something is not working. Most of all, remember what really matters to you \u2013 and trust your inner voice.\u00a0\nHow are you going to bring joy into your life in the coming months? I am exploring the heel of the Italian peninsula (Puglia) on a bicycle in April before participating in the final AIDS Vaccine charity bike ride near Atlanta in May. I hope both activities will help me stay centered and strong for the challenges ahead of us.\nWishing you a beautiful spring,\nRita\n \n \nTaming:\n \nCultivating Your Practice\n \nGet physical. Do something new with your hands.\nWhen I get nervous or worried or when I am looking for distraction, I find it helpful to do something with my hands. By using my body in this way and engaging a different part of my brain, I tend to feel more grounded and centered. There are many ways to \u201cget physical\u201d (in addition to exercising, cleaning, cooking, gardening, etc.).\u00a0\u00a0For instance:\nKnitting, crocheting, needlepoint or other kinds of crafts\n. I recently found a great \u201ccrocheting starter kit\u201d at an outfitters store. BTW, men knit, too. :-)\n \nWorking on art projects\n. We did a lot of that during the pandemic. Why not resurrect some of the activities from a few years ago? I mentioned taking up water-color painting in my last blog (finally scheduled for May \u2013 some things take a while to come to fruition).\n \nDoing\n\u00a0\njigsaw puzzles\n. \nThis is a still one of my favorite activities during colder weather. I currently have a very challenging 1000-piece jigsaw puzzle set up in my living room on a nifty new\u00a0\n\u201c\npuzzle board\n\u201d\n\u00a0that rotates.\n \nAnother \u201cphysical\u201d practice that many of us have lost touch with and that almost seems ancient and somewhat quaint now is\u00a0\nletter-writing\n. Yes, I mean a REAL letter, not a greeting card or a postcard (although those arrive at my house less and less frequently, too). I wrote about four or five letters this past year, and it was hard. My fingers were not used to holding a pen for so long, and my handwriting looked like that of a toddler towards the end of the letter. Still, I enjoyed this type of focused activity, and I felt good about the amount of physical and mental effort I had put into it once I was done. I also sometimes cut out newspaper articles and send them to friends \u2013 and they always comment on how touched they are to have received my letter. Why not surprise one of your loved ones with a special handwritten gift sometime?\n \n \nCommunity: Offerings for Practicing in Community\nAre you drawn to meditation? Have you tried it but gave up again?\u00a0\nJoin us online every Wednesday from 12-12:30pm EST for our free 30-min Midweek Mindfulness Meditation, and meditate with people from around the world.\u00a0\nDrop in as you can. Includes a check-in, a brief talk and 10-15 minutes of silent meditation. Free and open to anyone who is interested in practicing meditation in community. If you\u2019d like to receive a weekly reminder to participate, sign up\u00a0\nhere\n.\u00a0\n \nCool Resource\ns\nMinimal Reliance and Hope\n\"10% Happier with Dan Harris\u201d podcast\":\u00a0\n\"\n9 Ways to Break Free From the Habits That Are Holding You Back with Dr. Rangan Chatterjee\n\"\n\u00a0\n(2/3/2025). In this episode, Dan Harris talks with UK-based physician and author Dr. Rangan Chatterjee about things that can hold you back, including the tendency to only listen to what \u201cthe experts\u201d tell you instead of practicing \u201cminimal reliance\u201d and trusting your inner wisdom.\u00a0\nSubstack seems to be THE place where podcasters and bloggers post their offerings these days. I follow several writers, authors, teachers and activists whose posts I find interesting and inspiring. Here is a \npost by author and activist Patti Digh on HOPE\n\u00a0\n(3/25/2025)\n\u00a0\nand how to strengthen your \u201chope muscle.\u201d\n\u200a\nClick here to read \u00a0previous posts\n \n\u200a\n \nWant to bring mindfulness to your workplace?\nIf you or your organization are interested in bringing\u00a0mindfulness to your workplace and would\u00a0like to discuss what that might look like, please\u00a0\ncontact me\n\u00a0- and we'll set up an initial\u00a0(no-obligation) meeting.\n \n\u200a\nTell me what you think!\nI welcome any comment or question about anything mentioned in this blog.

Eligible purchases can be made by the Basic Card Member and any Additional Card Members on a single Card account. Eligible purchases are purchases for goods and services minus returns and other credits. Eligible purchases to meet the spend requirement do NOT include fees or interest charges, cash advances, purchases of traveler's checks, purchases or reloading of prepaid cards, purchases of gift cards, person-to-person payments, or purchases of any cash equivalents. Additional Card Members on your account are not eligible for their own offer. In rare instances, your period to spend $12,000 may be shorter than 6 months if there is a delay in receiving your Card. Also, purchases may fall outside of the 6 month period in some cases, such as a delay in merchants submitting transactions to us or if the purchase date differs from the date you made the transaction. (For example, if you buy goods online, the purchase date may be the date the goods are shipped). This offer is not transferable. If your application is not received by 04/02/2025, we will not process your application even if we later receive your application. American Express reserves the right to modify or revoke offer at any time. \u00a0\u200b\nIf you have a history of cancelling or downgrading American Express Card accounts within your first year and you cancel or downgrade your new Card account within your first year, we may not credit, we may freeze, or we may take away the bonus miles from your account. If we determine that you have engaged in abuse, misuse, or gaming in connection with this offer in any way or that you intend to do so, including if you return purchases you made to meet the Threshold Amount, we may not credit, we may freeze, or we may take away the bonus miles from your account. We may also cancel any accounts you have with us.\u200b\n2\n. \nTakeOff 15\n:\nEligibility\n:\u200b\nBasic Delta SkyMiles Gold, Platinum and Reserve American Express Card Members, as well as Basic Delta SkyMiles Gold, Platinum and Reserve Business American Express Card Members (each, an \u201cEligible Card\u201d), can get at least a fifteen percent (15%) discount off the mileage portion of an Award Ticket (the \u201cTakeOff 15\u201d benefit). Additional Card Members are not eligible. \u200b\nAvailable only if entire itinerary is on Delta and Delta Connection\n\u00ae\n carrier-operated and ticketed flights booked at \ndelta.com \nor the FlyDelta app. Not available on flights operated by other carriers. Not available for Pay with Miles, Miles + Cash, seat upgrades purchased after the initial flight booking, or other Delta products or services. Discount only applies to the mileage portion of the Award Ticket fare and does not apply to applicable taxes and fees which must be paid using the Eligible Card. Card Member must be logged-in to a SkyMiles account linked to an Eligible Card to receive the TakeOff 15 benefit discount. Mileage discount will be greater than or equal to 15% of the overall miles portion for the Award Ticket. An Award Ticket is a ticket issued by Delta pursuant to the SkyMiles Program Rules, by which SkyMiles members may redeem miles and pay applicable government-imposed taxes and fees in exchange for air transportation. All Award Ticket rules apply, as set forth on \ndelta.com\n and in the specific terms incorporated into your Award Ticket. Award Travel is defined as travel using an Award Ticket. Award Travel seats are limited and may not be available on all flights or in all markets.\u200b\nSkyMiles account balance must have sufficient miles for the entire Award Ticket(s) being purchased. TakeOff 15 benefit is not combinable with certificates, Delta eCredits, Delta Gift Cards, vouchers, or with any other discounts or promotional offers.\u00a0\nAward Ticket Taxes/Fees\n:\u200b\nAward Ticket taxes and fees include only U.S. excise and departure/arrival taxes, airport charges, segment fees, the September 11th Security Fee, and international taxes and fees normally included in the Award Ticket. \u200b\nAward Ticket Cancellations and Changes\n:\u200b\nIn the event of a voluntary cancellation of the Award Ticket to which the TakeOff 15 benefit was applied, redeemed miles will be redeposited into the Card Member\u2019s SkyMiles account, except for Basic Economy tickets. Current Award Ticket redeposit fees apply. Basic Economy cancellations will result in cancellation charge assessed in miles, as outlined in fare rules. Remaining miles after deduction of the cancellation charge will be redeposited to Card Member\u2019s SkyMiles account. There is no discount applicable to the cancellation charge. \u00a0\u200b\nIf changing an Award Ticket after ticketing, discount is applied to the new Award Ticket (if eligible), and the difference in miles will be deducted from the Card Member\u2019s SkyMiles account (if the new Award Ticket mileage amount is higher) or redeposited into the Card Member\u2019s SkyMiles account (if the new Award Ticket mileage amount is lower). Basic Economy tickets are not eligible for voluntary changes. SkyMiles Member must be an active Basic Delta SkyMiles, Gold, Platinum or Reserve American Express Card Member or Basic Delta SkyMiles Gold, Platinum or Reserve Business American Express Card Member at time that the Award Ticket is changed to be eligible for the TakeOff 15 benefit on the changed Award Ticket.\u200b\nMiscellaneous\n:\u200b\nAll SkyMiles Program rules apply to SkyMiles Program membership, miles, offers, mile accrual, mile redemption, and travel benefits.
