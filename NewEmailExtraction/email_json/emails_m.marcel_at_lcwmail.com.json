    "body": "Plus, a sneak peek inside the National Public Housing Museum. Here\u2019s what you need to know today.\n \n.\nTo view this email as a web page, click \nhere.\nThursday - April 3, 2025\nToday's \nRundown\n is brought to you by WBEZ members and\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\nby Bianca Cseke\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\nGood afternoon! It\u2019s Thursday, and I\u2019m excited to check out the Art Institute\u2019s first \nFrida Kahlo exhibit\n. Here\u2019s what you need to know today.\n\u00a0 \n1.\nA Venezuelan man arrested by ICE is set to be released temporarily to donate a kidney to his brother\n\u00a0\nJose Gregorio Gonzalez is set to be temporarily released, according to members of the Resurrection Project, a local immigration advocacy group, which said ICE officials confirmed his likely release tomorrow. He has been held at Clay County Detention Center in Indiana since his arrest last month.\nHis brother, Jose Alfredo Pacheco Gonzalez, said at a news conference this week that he was diagnosed with end-stage kidney failure in late 2023, not long after arriving in Chicago from Venezuela.\u00a0\nDoctors say he needs a life-saving kidney transplant, and his brother, who has lived in the U.S. since 2024, was set to be that donor before he was arrested by U.S. Immigration and Customs outside their Cicero home last month. He faces potential deportation to Venezuela.\n\u201cRelief in this case is not necessarily that Jose Gregorio gets to stay, it could very much mean that he still goes back,\u201d Peter Meinecke, an attorney with the Resurrection Project who is representing Jose Gregorio Gonzalez, told the Sun-Times. \u201cDelaying deportation would allow him to save his brother\u2019s life.\u201d [\nChicago Sun-Times/WBEZ\n]\n2.\nThe U.S. and Canada have long managed the Great Lakes together. That could be ending.\n\u00a0\nPolitical tensions, especially over tariffs, are threatening the future of the largest freshwater ecosystem on Earth, Juanpablo Ramirez-Franco and Izzy Ross report for WBEZ and Grist.\nSince taking office, President Donald Trump and his administration have repeatedly stoked tensions with Canada, once considered one of the United States\u2019 closest allies. Along with trade and tariffs, this strife has also raised questions about how the region\u2019s water resources will be managed.\u00a0\nSome Great Lakes advocates worry the diplomatic snub is a warning sign one of the world\u2019s most successful examples of water-sharing could become collateral damage in a geopolitical rift.\n\u201cWe are worried that maybe behind all this is the idea that a country one day will be able to take water out of the Great Lakes and manage water not as an ecosystem that needs to be preserved in its watershed but as a resource, as a commodity,\u201d said J\u00e9r\u00f4me Marty, speaking as the director of the International Association for Great Lakes Research. [\nWBEZ\n]\nSPONSOR MESSAGE FROM EXPO CHICAGO\nEXPO CHICAGO returns April 24-27\nEXPO CHICAGO returns April 24\u201327 to Navy Pier for its 12th edition. Featuring over 170 galleries from 93 cities and 36 countries, EXPO CHICAGO offers a week of dynamic programming you won\u2019t want to miss! Secure your tickets now at \nexpochicago.com.\n3.\nResisting mayoral pressure, Choose Chicago picked tourism vet Kristen Reynolds as its CEO\n\u00a0\nChoose Chicago has named Kristen Reynolds to fill the key post, which has been the highest-paid public position in Chicago, my colleagues David Roeder and Fran Spielman write for the Chicago Sun-Times. Reynolds comes to Chicago after 27 years in tourism leadership, the last decade as CEO of New York\u2019s Discover Long Island.\nShe will take over an organization that, with public and private funding, is tasked with promoting Chicago against cities that have much larger budgets to market themselves. While Chicago has seen growth in business and leisure travel, it still hasn\u2019t hit record numbers it recorded just before the pandemic.\nReynolds\u2019 hiring ends a more than yearlong search extended by tension between Choose Chicago\u2019s high-powered board of business leaders and Mayor Brandon Johnson. The board wanted a tourism veteran with a proven track record, while sources said the mayor urged the hiring of an ally with no background in an insular industry. [\nChicago Sun-Times\n]\n4.\nTwo Jewish students attacked while supporting Israel on campus are suing DePaul\n\u00a0\nThe lawsuit claims the university was negligent and failed to protect the students\u2019 safety while on campus, Mary Norkol reports for the Chicago Sun-Times.\nOn Nov. 6, Max Long and Michael Kaminsky were outside DePaul\u2019s student center when they were approached and attacked by two men wearing black face masks, according to Chicago police. The men beat them with their fists and either a soda can or water bottle, according to the complaint filed yesterday in Cook County Circuit Court.\nA DePaul spokesperson said the university values the safety of its students and condemned antisemitism. The school is working with Chicago police on the investigation and said resources are available to students who were affected. [\nChicago Sun-Times\n]\n5.\nThe National Public Housing Museum opens this week in Chicago. Here\u2019s a sneak peek.\n\u00a0\nAbout 20 years ago, when many of Chicago\u2019s public housing units were being torn down after years of neglect, some former residents rallied to preserve one building among the Jane Addams Homes, one of the first Chicago Housing Authority projects, built in the 1930s.\nThat remaining building, at 919 S. Ada St., on Chicago\u2019s Near West Side, is now the National Public Housing Museum, which opens tomorrow after years of fundraising and construction, Esther Yoon-Ji Kang reports for WBEZ.\nWhile many Chicagoans are familiar with the disinvestment, decaying buildings and gang violence associated with public housing, the museum aims to paint a fuller picture of the history of buildings in the United States \u2014 one focused on the people who lived there. [\nWBEZ\n]\n\u00a0\nHere's what else is happening\n\u00a0\nThe Dow dropped 1,400 points as U.S. stocks led a worldwide sell-off after Trump\u2019s tariffs. [\nAP\n]\nK-12 schools must say no to DEI to receive federal money, the Trump administration said. [\nAP\n]\nThe Pentagon\u2019s acting inspector general announced an investigation into Pete Hegseth\u2019s use of a Signal chat for Houthi attack plans. [\nAP\n]\nHere\u2019s a behind-the-scenes look at the Nintendo Switch 2, which hits the market in June. [\nAP\n]\n\u00a0\nOh, and one more thing...\n\u00a0\nGeorge Freeman was a Chicago legend and part of a family that constituted a bit of Chicago jazz royalty, Mitch Dudek writes for the Chicago Sun-Times. Freeman died Monday at age 97.\nFreeman\u2019s brothers were vaunted jazz saxophonist Von Freeman and drummer Eldridge \u201cBruz\u201d Freeman. George Freeman was also the uncle of saxophonist Chico Freeman.\nThe April 11 and 12 shows George Freeman was slated to play at the Green Mill will go on as scheduled, but will now be a tribute by his three bandmates.\nJazz guitarists traditionally favor a polite, reserved tone, but Freeman\u2019s sound was nastier and grungier, a raw and stinging attack that could bridge the gap between Chicago jazz and Chicago blues. [\nChicago Sun-Times\n]\n\u00a0\nTell me something good\n\u00a0\nWhat\u2019s the best book you\u2019ve read recently? I finally have some room on my library hold list, and I always feel like staying in for weeks after getting back from long trips.\nJoyce writes:\n\u201cOne of the best books I\u2019ve recently read was \nThe Women\n by Kristin Hannah. Being a teenager in the 1970\u2019s the Vietnam War was always in the news, but it seemed to be all about the boys over there. When I read this book about the women that were there it made me stop and pause thinking what a shame it was that it took so long to bring this topic out in the open and give not only the men who served recognition but the women who deserved it as well.\u201d\nSusan writes:\n\u201cI really enjoyed reading \nYoung Woman and the Sea\n by Glenn Stout \u2014 about the first woman to swim across the English Channel. The movie is really good too.\nI\u2019m also in the middle of \nAll the Light You Cannot See\n by Anthony Doer. I\u2019ve seen it recommended for awhile now, and now I can see why. It tells a story from a couple narrators during WWII. It\u2019s so well written and hard to put down.\u201d\nAnd Marcos writes:\n\u201cThe best book I've read recently was \nSomewhere Beyond the Sea\n by TJ Klune. It is the sequel to \nThe House on the Cerulean Sea\n. In a time of growing division in our country, I found in this book a beacon of hope, in the power of chosen family, and what it means to show up for one another as community. It paints the picture of the type of world I think we are capable of creating. Cannot recommend enough!\u201d\nFeel free to email me, and your response may be included in the newsletter this week.\nThanks for reading and have a nice night! I'll see you tomorrow.\n\u2014 Bianca Cseke\nThe Rundown is reader-funded.\u00a0\nYour gift of any amount helps power this newsletter and all of WBEZ\u2019s reporting.\u00a0\nDONATE TODAY\n\u00a9Chicago Public Media Inc 848 East Grand Ave, Navy Pier Chicago, IL 60611\nUnsubscribe\u00a0from The Daily Rundown\n\u00a0| \nPrivacy Policy",

The Frosh/Soph game against Deerfield has been moved to another location so we can play there. Also, the bus will be leaving from DCP at 3:00pm today. My apologies for not relaying this information earlier.\nLooking ahead to the remaining games on our schedule this week:\nTomorrow's game at Riverside Brookfield isn't looking great, as the weather is supposed to get a bit rough with a lot of rain. I will communicate to you and the boys when I get information about this.\u00a0\nFor Thursday, we play at home against Amundsen, but based on the amount of rain we get tomorrow, Hoerner might be unplayable so I will let you all know about that when I hear.\u00a0\nFriday the boys will have the day off of practice.\u00a0\nFinally, Saturday we have a 10:00am game at Niles North. There will not be a bus to take us to this game, so we ask that you/the boys get themselves to the field (I will let them know when to get there when we get closer to that day).

The reality is that of the total 8(a) firms, 4,400 average $2.4 million annually in federal sales, while the top 1,400 average an impressive $11.8 million each year.\nSo, what sets these 1,400 firms apart from the other 75%? The answer lies in their strategic decision to obtain a GSA Schedule Contract. A GSA Schedule is a government-wide, \"evergreen\" contract that does not expire or have a spending cap, allowing firms to place their products and services in an approved price catalog accessible to all federal buyers.\nOn average, GSA Schedule holders generate $1.6 million per year in sales from their contracts\u2014an impressive figure, yet it does not fully explain the substantial gap between the $11.8 million and the $2.4 million averages.\u00a0\nHere\u2019s why having a GSA Schedule is pivotal:\n1. Visibility for Federal Buyers: \nFederal buyers utilize GSA Schedules for market research. Without a GSA Schedule, your firm risks being overlooked. While some may view sam.gov as a competitor for finding 8(a) firms, consider the difference: a concise paragraph in a capabilities statement versus access to an entire price catalog.\n2. Increased Trust:\n GSA Schedules provide an added layer of assurance to federal buyers, fostering confidence in the products and services they are procuring.\n3. Access to Opportunities:\n GSA Schedule holders can engage with GSA eBuy, an online platform where firms can access smaller projects, allowing them to establish a foothold with federal agencies.\n4. Gateway to Further Opportunities:\n Securing a GSA Schedule often serves as a stepping stone for firms to pursue additional government-wide contracting vehicles.\nFor those looking to obtain 8(a) Certification and maximize the benefits of their nine years of eligibility, we highly recommend that you pursue a GSA Schedule concurrently with your 8(a) Certification. This strategic alignment could significantly enhance your firm's success in the federal marketplace. If federal contracting is an integral part of your marketing plan, don\u2019t hesitate to reach out to us. We are here to assist you with your eligibility and guide you through the process to ensure you capitalize on these valuable opportunities.

Here\u2019s what you need to know today.\n \n.\nTo view this email as a web page, click \nhere.\nWednesday - April 2, 2025\nToday's \nRundown\n is brought to you by WBEZ members and\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\nby Bianca Cseke\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\nGood afternoon! It\u2019s Wednesday, and today I learned there\u2019s a new \u201csunshine\u201d \nsparkling water flavor\n. (As a sparkling water sommelier, I\u2019m really hoping it doesn\u2019t literally taste like sunflowers.) Here\u2019s what else you need to know today.\u00a0\n\u00a0 \n1.\nChicago\u2019s murder drop \u2018mirrors a lot of big cities,\u2019 a leading crime data analyst says\n\u00a0\nThe year\u2019s first three months had fewer murders than any quarter since early 2019, and the city\u2019s annual murder count has been dropping since 2021, my WBEZ colleague Chip Mitchell reports.\nChicago finished the year\u2019s first quarter this week with 96 murders, a drop of more than 15% from the first three months of last year.\nData analyst Jeff Asher, who closely follows crime numbers in Chicago and other U.S. cities, told WBEZ these numbers mirror national trends, including in Baltimore, Philadelphia and New Orleans.\nBeyond murders, other violent crimes like batteries and robberies are also down, despite public perceptions that crime is increasing.\n\u201cI think the biggest factor is that we generally don\u2019t have a lot of really good crime data,\u201d Asher said. \u201cOnly recently have we been in a position to measure hundreds of cities and build a national sample to tell what the trends are. So, it leads to people basically relying on anecdotes: \u2018Have I seen more robberies in the news than I saw last year?\u2019 And you\u2019re always going to have a recency bias: \u2018How can crime possibly be down if, three weeks ago, my cousin\u2019s barber was robbed?\u2019 \u201d [\nWBEZ\n]\n2.\nIllinois home insurance prices jumped 50% in three years \u2014 the second-highest in the country, a study shows\n\u00a0\nA typical homeowner in Illinois is paying almost $1,000 more per year for home insurance in 2024 compared with three years earlier, an increase that also impacts potential homebuyers, Stephanie Zimmermann and David Struett report for the Chicago Sun-Times.\nThe average cost last year for $350,000 worth of replacement coverage from one of the six major insurers in Illinois was $2,942, up from $1,968 in 2021, according to a nationwide analysis of insurance rate data by the Consumer Federation of America.\nStates like Florida and Louisiana saw higher prices for home insurance, but the rate of increase in Illinois raises concerns about affordability in a state that\u2019s far away from hurricanes and wildfires, the study\u2019s authors said.\nBridgeport resident Ellen Grimes said she has tried finding a more affordable homeowners insurance policy for her two-flat but kept getting rejected by companies that didn\u2019t want to insure her 1880s-era home. Her annual premium this year is $3,246. In 2020, it was $2,423. [\nChicago Sun-Times\n]\nSPONSOR MESSAGE FROM MEEZ MEALS\nYour Personal Sous Chef Has Arrived\nA completely new approach to scratch-cooking.\n \u00a0Ingredients arrive chopped and prepped (no dicing onions/peeling carrots). From unboxing to sizzling skillet to dinner table in 30 minutes!\nLocal Meez Meals has \nno subscriptions\n and offers over \ntwo dozen customizations\n including no dairy, gluten-free, no onions\u2026\nVisit \nmeezmeals.com\n, use code \nRADIO\n for 50% off first order!\n3.\nMayor Brandon Johnson urges ticket scofflaws to take advantage of the city\u2019s three-month amnesty program\n\u00a0\nThe mayor is offering Chicagoans an opportunity to dig their way out of the financial hole created by unpaid parking tickets and other outstanding vehicular violations, my colleague Fran Spielman writes for the Chicago Sun-Times.\nIf a resident\u2019s eligible vehicle ticket debt was placed in what\u2019s known as final determination status before Dec. 31, 2023, that outstanding debt can now be settled by paying only the base fine by June 30.\n\u201cThis program also includes relief on towing, storage and booting fees. Plus, those late payment penalties and collection costs are waived. Even if you are currently on a payment plan for ticket debt, you qualify for this relief program,\u201d Johnson said. \u201cTo Chicagoans who have old ticket debt, this is your chance for a fresh start. So do not wait. Go to \nChicago.gov/vdr\n\u2026 to find out more and pay your tickets.\u201d [\nChicago Sun-Times\n]\n4.\nVenezuelans in Chicago are relieved their deportation protection is safe, for now\n\u00a0\nMany celebrated the news that a federal judge had paused the Trump administration\u2019s plan to end temporary protected status for Venezuelans this month, my colleague Adriana Cardona-Maguigad reports.\nTemporary Protected Status, or TPS, allows non-U.S. citizens from 17 countries, including Venezuela, to live and work in the United States if they face extremely difficult or unsafe conditions in their home country. The Trump administration announced an end to the program for Venezuelans in February.\nLuciano Pedota, co-founder of the Illinois Venezuelan Alliance, told WBEZ the court\u2019s ruling is important because the government couldn\u2019t prove extending TPS for Venezuelans poses a danger to the United States or that it\u2019s safe for them to return to Venezuela. [\nWBEZ\n]\n5.\nChicago restaurants Galit, Maxwells Trading, Kumiko are among the 2025 James Beard Award finalists\n\u00a0\nFive Chicago restaurants are finalists for this year\u2019s James Beard Awards.\nLincoln Park\u2019s ode to Middle Eastern cuisine Galit is a finalist for Outstanding Restaurant, while Maxwells Trading, HaiSous and Oriole are all among this year\u2019s finalists in the Best Chef Great Lakes category, the James Beard Foundation announced today. The list was culled from 22 Chicago semifinalists announced in January.\nKumiko in the West Loop is nominated for Outstanding Bar. You can see the full list of finalists in the link.\nThis year marks the 35th anniversary of the coveted awards, which are named for the late James Beard, a pioneering American chef. Often dubbed \u201cthe Oscars of the culinary world,\u201d the prize has become the nation\u2019s top food honor. [\nWBEZ\n]\n\u00a0\nHere's what else is happening\n\u00a0\nA federal judge dropped the corruption case against New York City Mayor Eric Adams. [\nNPR\n]\nDespite Elon Musk\u2019s millions, Democratic-backed Susan Crawford won a Wisconsin Supreme Court seat. [\nAP\n]\nTop Gun\n star Val Kilmer died at 65. [\nAP\n]\nThe Illinois Secretary of State opened a new flagship center downtown. [\nChicago Sun-Times\n]\n\u00a0\nOh, and one more thing...\n\u00a0\nIn 1995, Tara Mallen co-founded Rivendell Theatre Ensemble with a mission to elevate the lives of women through theater.\u00a0\nThe company is now celebrating its 30th anniversary season with the world premiere of \nNo Such Thing\n, a new work by Chicago playwright Lisa Dillman. It\u2019s about a creative woman in her 60s who reclaims her power by having a spicy affair with a younger man, WBEZ theater reporter Mike Davis writes.\n\u201cWe just learned that women\u2019s rights are not really very important, and that women\u2019s autonomy is being taken away from us on a daily basis across this country right now,\u201d said Mallen, who is Rivendell\u2019s artistic director. \u201cWe live in a country where guns have more rights than women.\u201d [\nWBEZ\n]\n\u00a0\nTell me something good\n\u00a0\nWhat\u2019s the best book you\u2019ve read recently? I finally have some room on my library hold list, and I always feel like staying in for weeks after getting back from long trips.\nJacqueline writes:\n\u201cThe best book I've read more recently would probably be \nThe Book Censor's Library\n by Bothayna Al-Essa which was an absolutely fantastic and scarily relevant book. But the best book I\u2019ve read this year is definitely \nEast of Eden\n by John Steinbeck which I wish I had read sooner because it is one of the best books I have ever read. Anyone who wants a good story with gorgeous prose should read this epic familial battle of good and evil. It\u2019s a classic for a reason.\u201d\nKalpana writes:\n\u201c\nThursday Murder Club\n by Richard Osman. A [group] of octogenarians solving murders at a retirement home in the UK. Can\u2019t wait to read the sequel and the movie when it comes out.\u201d\nAnd Ann writes:\n\u201c\nJames\n by Percival Everett is the retelling of the Huck Finn story from the point of view of Jim, the enslaved man. Wow, what a book. Marvelously written, holds your interest from start to finish, and gives you a visceral feeling of what it would be like to be a runaway slave.\u201d\nFeel free to email me, and your response may be included in the newsletter this week.\nThanks for reading and have a nice night! I'll see you tomorrow.\n\u2014 Bianca Cseke\nThe Rundown is reader-funded.\u00a0\nYour gift of any amount helps power this newsletter and all of WBEZ\u2019s reporting.\u00a0\nDONATE TODAY\n\u00a9Chicago Public Media Inc 848 East Grand Ave, Navy Pier Chicago, IL 60611\nUnsubscribe\u00a0from The Daily Rundown\n\u00a0| \nPrivacy Policy",

We will NOT be practicing today, so the boys have the day off! We are hoping to get this game rescheduled for this Friday (location to be determined). When this is finalized, I will circle back to let you all know. Tomorrow's game is also questionable based on the amount of rain we've gotten/will get throughout the day today, so I will let you and the boys know about that tomorrow when we know more.

We will now be playing on their Lower Level field, located behind their Varsity field. Their Varsity field is still underwater, but the Lower Level field is playable! The Frosh/Soph game against Deerfield has been moved to another location so we can play there. Also, the bus will be leaving from DCP at 3:00pm today. My apologies for not relaying this information earlier.\nLooking ahead to the remaining games on our schedule this week:\nTomorrow's game at Riverside Brookfield isn't looking great, as the weather is supposed to get a bit rough with a lot of rain. I will communicate to you and the boys when I get information about this.\u00a0\nFor Thursday, we play at home against Amundsen, but based on the amount of rain we get tomorrow, Hoerner might be unplayable so I will let you all know about that when I hear.\u00a0\nFriday the boys will have the day off of practice.\u00a0\nFinally, Saturday we have a 10:00am game at Niles North. There will not be a bus to take us to this game, so we ask that you/the boys get themselves to the field (I will let them know when to get there when we get closer to that day). Niles North is a turf field, so even with the projected rain in the forecast, I'm hoping we can still get this game in!\u00a0\nAgain, I will make sure to communicate with you and the boys when I get word on these games.\nBest,\nCoach Hinkamp\nBest,\nCoach Hinkamp\nOn Sun, Mar 30, 2025 at 2:36\u202fPM Zachary Hinkamp <\nzhinkamp@depaulprep.org\n> wrote:\nHello all,\nI hope you\u2019ve had a great weekend!

How to Sell to the Government\nLearn More >>>\nHow to Sell to the Government\nSelling to the Federal Government seems daunting and for most people, knowing where to be is a massive challenge. Once you get in and develop a marketing plan, piece by piece things start to come together and the federal government then becomes like working with any large corporation.\nThe reality is that people want to do business with people they know. Federal employees must follow FAR (Federal Acquisitions Regulations) in their purchasing however they also need confidence that the services they are acquiring will meet their mission goals. This gives federal employees the ability to weigh past performance enough to go with firms they have a track record with.\nStep 1 \u2013 Getting Ready and Prospecting for Federal Business\nBuilding Lists of Key Decision Makers\nThere are sources such as sam.gov where you can look at awarded contracts and back into the contracting officers that awarded those contracts. This is a good way to build relationships and increase their confidence that you will be able to perform future work for their agency. Additionally, these contractors will sometimes have smaller projects they can award to you to \u201ctry you out\u201d. Only a small percentage of available contracts are posted on sam.gov, often sam.gov as a procurement avenue is reserved for needs that the federal government does not already have a vendor in mind for the procurement.\nSBA Certifications\nSBA Certifications also can help you by gaining introductions through letters of introduction by SBA Business Development Specialists. Federal procurement officers are more likely to respond to other federal employees than to outside businesses seeking to solicit them. Through meetings obtained in this manner often a procurement officer will tell you about the potential for a sole source or direct award contract or a set-aside contract that applies to your specific certification.\nSubcontracting\nMany firms start with subcontracting before they become prime contractors. Generally, this is advisable to all SBA certification holders except for 8(a) firms who should focus on prime contracts because 8(a) firms are only permitted to be in the 8(a) program for 9 years while the other certifications can be maintained and therefore are evergreen.\nOnce a firm makes contacts within an agency, they can then network within that agency, learn the lingo, and unique needs of that agency, and better position themselves for making the jump into federal contracting.\nGSA Schedules\nA GSA Schedule can be an effective way of breaking into the federal government. There are some business requirements such as years in business and being able to provide several references to obtain a contract. The GSA pre-vets your firm and this adds confidence to federal buyers, it also adds visibility, and the ability to bid on contracts only GSA contract holders can bid on through GSA-eBuy. A GSA Schedule also provides your firm with a government-wide contract so when you find an interested federal buyer you don\u2019t get the \u201cI would love to buy from you but... I have no FAR compliant way of doing so\u2026\u201d\nSam.gov formerly Fbo.gov\nEvery day firms find procurements that are a good match for their firm through sam.gov. Monitoring sam.gov for opportunities for your firm to bid on should be an important part of any federal sales break-in strategy.\nStep 2 \u2013 Target your Agencies\nYour firm needs to begin by getting the targets down to approximately three agencies. From there once you begin getting to know those agencies ideally you get it down to one. Your geographical service area and capabilities should match the needs of this agency. By focusing on this one agency, you will learn who the key decision makers are for your goods and services, what things matter most to an agency to tailor your offerings as well as key terminology and what role you can play in carving out a niche for your firm.\n\ufeff\nStep 3 \u2013 Take Advantage of Your Opportunity\nFederal Contact Performance Evaluation\nBeing vigilant in your communication with contracting officers about your performance on a contract is critical to achieving an \u201cexcellent\u201d performance evaluation. Below is a scale as to how your performance will be graded by federal agencies. A \u201cgood\u201d performance evaluation is the minimum level a firm should achieve if it hopes to continue working with the government. \u201cExcellent\u201d is how you build your business.\nFrom conversations we have had with contracting officers, all things being equal a firm with an \u201cexcellent\u201d rating can charge as much as 7% more and still be awarded the contract over a firm with a \u201cgood\u201d rating. Therefore, know that the extra effort you put in today to ensure the \u201cexcellent\u201d rating will come back as increased profits down the road.\nStep 4 \u2013 Leveraging Your Past Performance\nNow it is time to grow your firm into other areas. It is time to focus on GWACs (Government-wide Acquisition Contracts), IDIQs (Indefinite Delivery Indefinite Quantity Contracts), and BPAs (Blanket Purchase Agreements). These contracting vehicles gain your firm access to large buckets of money and a finite number of vendors. These contracts also help your firm to break into other federal agencies that will order from these contracting vehicles and grow your business.\u00a0\nFirms with SBA Certification at this point should be moving from Sole Source Contracts to Set-aside Contracts. Sole Source Contacts are indeed non-competitive; however, Set-aside contracts are generally much larger and still have modest competition. So, firms that are trying to increase their sales will make this shift.\nIf your firm can execute this marketing plan you should be able to become a large federal contractor in approximately 4 years.\nEmily Hatchel\n\ufeff859-360-1320\nwww.fedvital.com\n\ufeff\nQuestions?\n Contact us today 1-859-360-1320\nFedvital\n10500 Norbotten Dr\nFlorence Kentucky 41042\nUnited States \nYou are subscribed to this email as monica@lcwmail.com.\nClick here to modify your \npreferences\n or \nunsubscribe\n.",

It facilitates woman-owned businesses' acquisition of their first government contract and helps them maintain their business relationships with federal agencies.\nPoint 2: Impressive 2024 WOSB Statistics\nIn 2024, around 14,606 WOSB firms worked with the federal government, making a combined $27.6 billion in sales. On average, each of these firms got about $2.2 million in federal contracts. These numbers show the real value of having WOSB certification, proving it's a smart move for woman-owned small businesses.\nPoint 3: Enhancing Sales through GSA Schedule Contracts\nObtaining a GSA Schedule Contract will enable WOSB businesses to increase sales even further. Direct sales from GSA Schedules to 3,663 WOSB companies totaled $8.3 billion in 2024. That works up to roughly $2.3 million in sales for each company. Thus, WOSB companies can boost their government sales and fortify their market position by utilizing a GSA Schedule, which is an effective strategy.\nPoint 4: Seven Advantages of GSA Schedule for WOSB Firms\nContracting Vehicle:\n Provides a FAR-compliant method for federal buyers to make purchases, addressing a common struggle for small businesses.\nMarket Research Visibility:\n Increases visibility through GSA Advantage, the preferred site for federal buyers' market research.\nAccess to GSA e-buy:\n Offers a specialized bulletin board for solicitation, facilitating initial sales to target agencies and subsequent opportunities.\nGateway to GWACs:\n Positions WOSB firms to enter Governmentwide Acquisition Contracts, reducing administrative burdens and demonstrating competency.\nSubcontracting Opportunities:\n Expand opportunities as prime contractors using a GSA Schedule are not subject to audit, saving compliance efforts.\nFlexibility with Products and Services:\n Enables quick addition of new products and services to the repertoire through GSA MAS Contract modifications.\nNon-Schedule Items Inclusion:\n Permits the addition of non-schedule items for completing contracts, provided over fifty percent are purchased from the firm's GSA Schedule.\nCombining WOSB Certification with a GSA Schedule is a smart strategy for woman-owned small businesses in federal contracting. The 2024 statistics and the advantages of the GSA Schedule clearly show that this approach not only helps in getting initial contracts but also sets the stage for ongoing growth and success in the federal market. It's strongly recommended for eligible businesses to go for both certifications, leading to a significant threefold increase in sales opportunities.\nGive us a call for an in-depth discussion and get you started now.\nEmily Hatchel\n859-360-1320\nwww.ezwosb.com\nQuestions?\n Contact us today 1-859-360-1320\nEZWOSB\n10500 Norbotten Dr\nFlorence Kentucky 41042\nUnited States \nYou are subscribed to this email as monica@lcwmail.com.\nClick here to modify your \npreferences\n or \nunsubscribe\n.",

    "body": "Plus, concerts to put on your calendar this month. Here\u2019s what you need to know today.\n \n.\nTo view this email as a web page, click \nhere.\nTuesday - April 1, 2025\nToday's \nRundown\n is brought to you by WBEZ members and\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\nby Bianca Cseke\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\nGood afternoon! It\u2019s Tuesday and the first day of April, which means \ntulips\n will soon start blooming in the Chicago area. Here\u2019s what you need to know today.\n\u00a0 \n1.\nTrump\u2019s promised \u2018Liberation Day\u2019 of tariffs is coming. Here\u2019s what it could mean for you.\n\u00a0\nPresident Donald Trump says tomorrow will be \u201cLiberation Day\u201d \u2014 a moment when he plans to roll out a set of tariffs that he promises will free the United States from foreign goods. It is also possible the tariffs are short-lived if Trump feels he can cut a deal after imposing them.\nAt stake are family budgets, America\u2019s prominence as the world\u2019s leading financial power and the structure of the global economy, The Associated Press reports.\nMost economists say the tariffs would get passed along to consumers in the form of higher prices for automobiles, groceries, housing and other goods. Corporate profits could be lower and growth more sluggish. Trump maintains more companies would open factories to avoid the taxes, though that process could take three years or more.\nTreasury Secretary Scott Bessent has suggested tariffs would be a one-time price adjustment, rather than the start of an inflationary spiral. But Bessent\u2019s conclusion rests on tariffs being brief or contained, rather than leading other countries to retaliate with their own tariffs or bleeding into other sectors of the economy such as services. [\nAP\n]\n2.\nCTU bargainers approved a tentative contract deal. Here\u2019s what you need to know.\n\u00a0\nA key Chicago Teachers Union committee spent hours yesterday going through a hefty package of proposals before finally approving a tentative agreement with Chicago Public Schools. It\u2019s a significant step toward finalizing a deal on a new four-year contract, my colleagues Sarah Karp and Nader Issa report.\nCTU members will get 4% raises in the first year, then up to 5% in the next three. CPS also gave elementary school teachers an additional 10 minutes of planning time per day.\nThe proposed settlement cleared the hurdle of the union\u2019s \u201cbig bargaining team,\u201d a group of 65 educators that has negotiated with the school district for almost a year. The CTU\u2019s 730-member House of Delegates meets tomorrow, with a ratification vote by all 30,000 members expected in the next week or two.\nOnce CTU members ratify the contract, the school board will have to approve it. Because the previous contract expired last June, the board also will have to amend its current budget to provide retroactive pay increases. A vote on that budget amendment and the unsuccessful efforts by the mayor\u2019s office to convince CPS to make a city pension payment that covers CPS workers have been a major source of conflict at the board.

[\nChicago Sun-Times\n]\n4.\nNorthwestern faces another congressional investigation\n\u00a0\nThis time, the Committee on Education and the Workforce argues legal clinics at the law school are using tax dollars to \u201cengage in progressive-left political advocacy,\u201d Patrick Smith reports for WBEZ.\nThe committee, which last year called Northwestern President Michael Schill and other university presidents to testify about antisemitism on campus, is asking for the budgets and funders for all of the school\u2019s 20-plus legal clinics. It\u2019s also asking for the personnel file of professor Sheila Bedi, director of Northwestern\u2019s Community Justice and Civil Rights Clinic, which works on \u201credressing over-policing and mass imprisonment.\u201d\nGeorgetown University Law professor Deborah Epstein told WBEZ she believes the letter will, on its own, have an immediate negative impact on legal advocacy throughout the country. [\nWBEZ\n]\n5.\n10 concerts that showcase the best of Chicago\u2019s small and midsize club scene\n\u00a0\nBesides the new buds popping up in gardens and parks throughout the Chicago area, another sign of spring is an active music calendar.\u00a0\nWBEZ music contributor Mark Guarino compiled a list of shows to see this month.\nThis Friday, Canadian-born producer, songwriter and musician Daniel Lanois, who has worked on albums as enduring as U2\u2019s \nThe Joshua Tree\n and Peter Gabriel\u2019s \nSo\n, takes the stage at the Epiphany Center for the Arts.\nLater this month, bluegrass songwriter and mandolinist Sierra Hull plays at Thalia Hall in support of her latest record, \nA Tip Toe High Wire\n.\nYou can see the full list in the link. [\nWBEZ\n]\n\u00a0\nHere's what else is happening\n\u00a0\nThe White House said it\u2019s \u201ccase closed\u201d on the Signal group chat review. [\nNPR\n]\nProsecutors have been directed to seek the death penalty against UnitedHealthcare CEO killing suspect Luigi Mangione. [\nAP\n]\nNASCAR Chicago Street Race announced upcoming closures for its July 5\u20136 event. [\nChicago Sun-Times\n]\nChicago Public Media announced leadership changes atop the Sun-Times and WBEZ. [\nChicago Sun-Times\n]\n\u00a0\nOh, and one more thing...\n\u00a0\nJamie Gustafson draws dinosaurs, sharks and pretty much anything else from the natural world.\u00a0\nSome of his clients have included National Geographic, DK Smithsonian and scientists at Chicago\u2019s Field Museum, my colleague Stefano Esposito reports for the Chicago Sun-Times.\nGustafson said he makes artistic choices based on science.\n\u201cWhen I take too many liberties, you get the paleontology police after you,\u201d he said. \u201cMy least favorite thing is when someone ... says, \u2018That\u2019s not what it looked like.\u2019 \u201d [\nChicago Sun-Times\n]\n\u00a0\nTell me something good\n\u00a0\nWhat\u2019s the best book you\u2019ve read recently? I finally have some room on my library hold list, and I always feel like staying in for weeks after getting back from long trips.\nSam writes:\n\u201cI just finished reading John Green\u2019s newest book, \nEverything is Tuberculosis\n. It\u2019s a sobering tale of how TB still kills over a million people worldwide every year, but it also has uplifting stories of things that are being done globally to improve access to diagnostic tools and treatments. Highly recommended!\u201d\nJerry writes:\n\u201c\ufeffI love historical fiction, but I was skeptical that a book about an orphan in Venice during the early 18th century who learns to play the violin would hold my attention. I\u2019m not particularly partial to classical music, but I was intrigued when I learned the teacher was Vivaldi, famous for \nThe Four Seasons\n symphony, and the orphan was an abandoned baby girl left at a famous institution in Venice managed by nuns. That said, \nThe Instrumentalist\n by Harriet Constable, is one of the best books I\u2019ve read this year. I was engaged from the start and the story has layers of interesting characters and social commentary. Good read even if historical fiction is not your first choice.\u201d\nSue writes:\n\u201cI really enjoyed \nThe Husbands\n, by Holly Gramazio. I hate saying too much because I wouldn't want to spoil it. It really made me think and laugh and was so unexpected.

We will now be playing on their Lower Level field, located behind their Varsity field. Their Varsity field is still underwater, but the Lower Level field is playable! The Frosh/Soph game against Deerfield has been moved to another location so we can play there. Also, the bus will be leaving from DCP at 3:00pm today. My apologies for not relaying this information earlier.\nLooking ahead to the remaining games on our schedule this week:\nTomorrow's game at Riverside Brookfield isn't looking great, as the weather is supposed to get a bit rough with a lot of rain. I will communicate to you and the boys when I get information about this.\u00a0\nFor Thursday, we play at home against Amundsen, but based on the amount of rain we get tomorrow, Hoerner might be unplayable so I will let you all know about that when I hear.\u00a0\nFriday the boys will have the day off of practice.\u00a0\nFinally, Saturday we have a 10:00am game at Niles North. There will not be a bus to take us to this game, so we ask that you/the boys get themselves to the field (I will let them know when to get there when we get closer to that day). Niles North is a turf field, so even with the projected rain in the forecast, I'm hoping we can still get this game in!\u00a0\nAgain, I will make sure to communicate with you and the boys when I get word on these games.\nBest,\nCoach Hinkamp\nBest,\nCoach Hinkamp\nOn Sun, Mar 30, 2025 at 2:36\u202fPM Zachary Hinkamp <\nzhinkamp@depaulprep.org\n> wrote:\nHello all,\nI hope you\u2019ve had a great weekend!

    "body": "Plus: Wall Street Bonuses Surge | The New Ivies Employers Love To Hire From | Federal Workers Hit The Job Market\nBECOME A MEMBER\n\u00a0\u2022\u00a0\nNewsletters\n\u00a0\u2022\u00a0\nMyForbes\nHappy Billionaires Day! It\u2019s a busy one here at \nForbes,\n as we just released our annual list of the world\u2019s billionaires, highlighting the richest\u2013\u2013and arguably most powerful\u2013\u2013people and families across the globe.\u00a0\nIn total, \nForbes \ntracked and documented the wealth of more than \n3,000 people worth a collective $16.1 trillion\n. The average fortune on the list now stands at $5.3 billion, a $200 million increase from 2024.\u00a0\nWhile many of the world\u2019s billionaires inherited their wealth, nearly 70% of the newest names on this year\u2019s list are \nself-made\n, meaning they founded or cofounded the company that made them their billions. The newcomers include 73-year-old Sulaiman Al Habib, founder and chairman of Saudi Arabia hospital group HMG, as well as Scale AI cofounder and CEO Alexandr Wang, the list\u2019s youngest self-made billionaire at just 28 years old.\nWang is one of just 21 individuals this year to reach billionaire status \nunder the age of 30\n. Of those, only Wang and 29-year-old Ed Craven are self-made, with Craven being the cofounder of Stake.com, thought to be the world\u2019s biggest crypto-backed online casino.\nSo what\u2019s the secret to their riches? For newcomer billionaire Steve Ells, it was \nChipotle\u2019s compensation plan.\n Though Ells sold most of his stock throughout his time as CEO and then chairman of the board at the fast-casual chain, the company\u2019s compensation plan continued to award him Chipotle stock as it kept rising.\u00a0\nAnd while it was the ultimate sale of \nfried chicken chain Zaxby\n that netted its cofounders their billions, it\u2019s the hard work they put into growing the business that allowed it to grow. Cofounder Tony Townley kept his day job running a mortgaging and loan business while running the first Zaxby location, sometimes mixing sometimes until 5 a.m.\nIt goes to show that while entrepreneurship can be a struggle, it can certainly pay off.\u00a0\nYou can read more about the world\u2019s richest \nhere\n.\u00a0\nMaria Gracia Santillana Linares\u00a0\nCareers Reporter\nFollow me on\u00a0\nForbes.com\nWORK SMARTER\nPractical insights and advice from Forbes staff and contributors to help you succeed in your job, accelerate your career and lead smarter.\nSimply growing your network\n online won\u2019t cut it\u2013\u2013there is no substitute for \nin-person connections\n.\u00a0\nWhat you need to know about \ntariffs\n \nif you\u2019re in the job market.\u00a0\nIf you\u2019re preparing to answer\n behavioral questions \nin your next job interview, consider \nthe CARL method.\u00a0\nWhy you should consider a \ngig job \nin \nthis labor market.\u00a0\nDeep Dive\nThe total estimated bonus pool for Wall Street bankers reached a high not seen in nearly 40 years.\n\u00a0 \nPhoto by STAN HONDA/AFP via Getty Images\nWall Street Banker Bonuses Surge\nRead Article\nAfter a profitable year for Wall Street in 2024, its \nbankers are cashing-in on generous bonuses\n. The New York State Comptroller said last week that bankers\u2019 bonuses rose 31.5% from the previous year, contributing to a total estimated bonus pool of $47.5 billion.\u00a0\nThe increase in performance incentives is largely due to one of the best years in history for the stock market and dealmaking. The S&P 500 and Nasdaq Composite each had record years in 2024, and Wall Street\u2019s profits rose 90%.\u00a0\n\u201cMost of the time bonuses are based off of two things: What is your personal performance and what is the company\u2019s performance,\u201d says Nich Tremper, economist at payroll provider Gusto. \u201cIt\u2019s discretionary compensation based on those two things.\u201d\nAdd a securities employment increase\u2013\u2013coming in at 201,500 employees, the highest annual level in at least 30 years, according to New York Comptroller Thomas DiNapoli\u2013\u2013and you\u2019ve got more employees earning six-figure salaries that qualified for the bonuses. Indeed, average salaries for analysts range from $160,000 to $210,000 per year after bonuses. That number can rise up to $475,000 for associates.\u00a0\nBut Wall Street wasn\u2019t the only place to see bonuses increase, albeit at a much lower rate. Average end-of-year bonuses for 2024 were up 2% compared to 2023 payouts for small businesses, according to a January report from \nGusto\n, though the total share of workers who received bonuses decreased.\u00a0\nApart from Wall Street, those in the communications, technology and professional services industries saw the greatest bonus growth.\nRetail, for example, saw an 8% increase in bonuses from 2023 to 2024. But one major retailer held back from them altogether, citing fiscal year performance results. Salaried employees at Target who were eligible for bonuses will only receive 87% of their potential bonus for fiscal year 2024,\n\u00a0\nHR Dive reported\n, down from the 100% they received the previous year.\u00a0\nThe state of the economy has a large part to play in how much employers are distributing to their workers. \u201cA bonus is backwards-looking,\u201d says Tremper. \u201cBut it\u2019s also forwards-looking. It\u2019s a business owner deciding that they don\u2019t need to keep that cash in the bank account and can actually invest that into their employees.\u201d \nTOUCH BASE\n \nIt\u2019s impossible to ignore the mounting criticisms of America\u2019s most exclusive colleges. These 20 schools\u201410 public and 10 private\u2014are stepping up to educate the country\u2019s brightest students and graduating the talent employers seek.\n \nForbes\n \nNews from the world of work\nAs the Ivy Leagues continue to amass criticism from wealthy alumni, parents of students and even the federal government,\n \nForbes\n released its second iteration of the New Ivies\n list. Employers are increasingly looking at graduates from these 20 public and private universities, including newcomers Washington University in St. Louis, the University of Pittsburgh and the United States Military Academy at West Point, Emma Whitford \nreports\n.\u00a0\nTop vaccine official \nPeter Marks quit his position at the Federal Drug Administration (FDA)\n on Friday, criticizing Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F. Kennedy\u2019s views on vaccines and his \u201cmisinformation and lies.\u201d He\u2019s not the first\u2014and certainly not the last\u2014federal employee to \nclash with his new boss.\n\u00a0\nJust days later, cuts at HHS \nreportedly\n began. \nKennedy is expected to cut about a quarter of the department\u2019s workforce,\n \nabout 10,000 employees\n, across regional offices, the CDC, FDA, NIH, and the Centers for Medicaid and Medicare.\nJob applications from federal workers are surging\n, \nIndeed reports\n. USDA workers and those working in DEI roles are likely hitting the job market the most, as searches for horticulture and employee relations roles increased by more than 10 times compared to this time last year. While most federal employees looking for work are still in the Washington, D.C. and Virginia area, \nTexas, California and Georgia\n are not far behind.\u00a0\u00a0\nAre you worried about a potential recession and how it could impact your job? \nForbes\u2019\n Derek Saul has been \ntracking economists\u2019 recession warnings\n as \u201cLiberation Day\u201d tariffs loom. \nHere\u2019s why it\u2019s not time to worry yet.\u00a0\nGen X creatives are in a career meltdown\n, the \nNew York Times\n \nreports\n.

Ignoring federal and academic research showing the success of hybrid and remote models, these policies risk damaging public service efficiency and triggering costly turnover\u2014just as seen under Biden\u2019s more moderate RTO approach.\nTo learn more, check out this \nblog\n.\nRead Blog\n \nPrefer video to text?

After you leave this meeting, you're going to find out better ways of making decisions and the choices you make and the impact that it has on your business, your personal life, and your spiritual life.\"\n-\u200c \nChet Tart\n, Vistage Chair\nSchedule a Free Consultation\n \nWhat's Up With Me\nIt\u2019s a puzzle to me why so many things that appear to be solely data-informed become so politicized.\n Why did WFH grow so politicized, for example? It\u2019s not obvious at all that Republicans should favor government employees working in the office: after all, you can save a lot of money on real estate, as well as on hiring and retention costs, since people are willing to work for less and have better retention when they work remotely at least some of the time. Furthermore, productivity metrics and morale are higher when people can work remotely at least some of the time. But clearly, this issue did become politicized. Is it because of a lack of trust in public workers? Well, you can simply institute more clear accountability and tracking mechanisms, rather than forcing people back to the office, and losing all the benefits. It\u2019s a clear example where culture wars win out over good, common business sense.\u00a0\nWould love to get your feedback on what you found most useful about this edition of the \u201cWise Decision Maker Guide\u201d - simply reply to this email.\nDecisively Yours,\nDr. Gleb\nDr. Gleb Tsipursky\nCEO of Disaster Avoidance Experts\nPS: Are we connected on LinkedIn?

    "body": "Hello all,\nI'm reaching out to let you know that there is a slight change for our game at Deerfield High School this afternoon at 4:30pm. We will now be playing on their Lower Level field, located behind their Varsity field. Their Varsity field is still underwater, but the Lower Level field is playable! The Frosh/Soph game against Deerfield has been moved to another location so we can play there. Also, the bus will be leaving from DCP at 3:00pm today. My apologies for not relaying this information earlier.\nLooking ahead to the remaining games on our schedule this week:\nTomorrow's game at Riverside Brookfield isn't looking great, as the weather is supposed to get a bit rough with a lot of rain. I will communicate to you and the boys when I get information about this.\u00a0\nFor Thursday, we play at home against Amundsen, but based on the amount of rain we get tomorrow, Hoerner might be unplayable so I will let you all know about that when I hear.\u00a0\nFriday the boys will have the day off of practice.\u00a0\nFinally, Saturday we have a 10:00am game at Niles North. There will not be a bus to take us to this game, so we ask that you/the boys get themselves to the field (I will let them know when to get there when we get closer to that day). Niles North is a turf field, so even with the projected rain in the forecast, I'm hoping we can still get this game in!\u00a0\nAgain, I will make sure to communicate with you and the boys when I get word on these games.\nBest,\nCoach Hinkamp\nBest,\nCoach Hinkamp\nOn Sun, Mar 30, 2025 at 2:36\u202fPM Zachary Hinkamp <\nzhinkamp@depaulprep.org\n> wrote:\nHello all,\nI hope you\u2019ve had a great weekend!

    "body": "As March comes to a close, we look to Transgender Day of Visibility (TDOV) on March 31\u2014a time to celebrate the resilience, brilliance, and achievements of transgender and nonbinary people everywhere. TDOV is not just about visibility itself, but about what visibility makes possible: greater understanding, stronger communities, and a world where transgender youth can thrive as their authentic selves.\nWe invite you to reflect on the powerful stories shared this month. Visibility matters, and so does action. From Champion Lily\u2019s panel at the NLGJA Student Conference to Champion Shailen\u2019s feature on Germany\u2019s ZDF, our work continues to spark meaningful conversations and change perspectives.\nBy supporting GenderCool\n, you help ensure that more people around the world see transgender and nonbinary youth for who they truly are: leaders, innovators, and changemakers shaping the future.\nRead on to see how GenderCool is celebrating Women\u2019s History Month and amplifying transgender voices in the media.\n \n \nMarch marks Women\u2019s History Month, a time to honor and celebrate the countless contributions of women who have shaped history and continue to inspire future generations. From pioneers in science and the arts to trailblazers in business and advocacy, women have long driven progress and forged paths toward a more inclusive world.\nAt GenderCool, we take this opportunity to uplift the voices of all women\u2014including transgender women\u2014whose brilliance and resilience have helped create the world we know today. Women\u2019s History is trans history, and the impact of transgender women across industries and movements is undeniable. Their courage, creativity, and leadership have paved the way for future generations to dream bigger and achieve more.\nAs an organization rooted in storytelling, we remain committed to amplifying the voices of women who are shaping a more inclusive future. The intersectionality of social justice reminds us that true progress means recognizing and celebrating all women.\nThroughout March, we\u2019ve highlighted trailblazing women whose contributions continue to inspire and empower. If you missed any of our spotlights, you can still check out our social channels to celebrate their impact and learn more about the leaders shaping a more inclusive future\u2014because the journey toward equality doesn\u2019t end when the month does.\nTogether, we honor the legacy of women\u2019s history while forging a brighter future.\n \n \nOn March 8, GenderCool Champion Lily (she/her) joined the NLGJA Student Conference as a panelist for \u201cCovering Transgender, Nonbinary, and Gender-Non-Conforming Communities.\u201d Speaking alongside Joseph Jaafari, Editor-in-Chief of LookOut, and Tat Bellamy-Walker, Program Manager for Digital Safety Training and Resources, Lily shared her experiences working with the media and the importance of accurate, authentic representation of transgender people in journalism.\nThis opportunity directly aligns with GenderCool\u2019s mission through helping to educate the next generation of journalists on how to responsibly and respectfully cover transgender and nonbinary stories. By equipping media students with the knowledge and perspective needed to tell these stories with care, Lily is helping to shape a future where transgender and nonbinary people are represented appropriately.\n \n \nOn March 9, an interview featuring GenderCool Champion Shailen and his family aired on ZDF, a leading news program in Germany. Filmed at Shailen\u2019s home, this segment introduced audiences to Shailen\u2019s story, providing an opportunity for viewers\u2014many of whom may have never met a transgender person\u2014to learn more about who he is in an authentic and personal way.\nFor those in our newsletter audience not fluent in German, here is a loose translation. \u201cFifteen-year-old Shailen has always known who he is. At twelve, he discovered the term transgender and embraced it fully. With the support of his family and friends, he began living openly as himself.\nDespite challenges faced by the transgender community, Shailen remains determined to live his life like any other teenager. He dreams of becoming an engineer and finds joy in everyday moments, like going to the movies with friends and playing guitar. His family is part of a nationwide project that amplifies the voices of trans youth, showing the world that they are just like other kids\u2014with hopes, dreams, and a deep sense of belonging.\nAs Shailen says, \u201cWe all have to work together as a team.\u201d His story is a reminder of the power of community, resilience, and the importance of standing together for a more inclusive future.\u201d\nThis interview is a powerful example of how GenderCool connects with new audiences, fostering understanding through storytelling. By sharing lived experiences, we help reshape narratives and create a world where transgender and nonbinary young people are seen for who they truly are.\nWatch the Segment Here!\n \n \n \nThis Transgender Day of Visibility, Out Leadership and The GenderCool Project are proud to introduce \"Hear Us Out\"\u2014a groundbreaking video series amplifying the voices of transgender and nonbinary leaders. Featuring 19 compelling personal stories, this campaign cuts through the noise, offering an unfiltered look at the experiences, resilience, and impact of trans and nonbinary individuals across industries, generations, and backgrounds.\nAt a time when misinformation and harmful rhetoric are on the rise, \"Hear Us Out\" brings clarity and humanity to a critical conversation. With over 800 anti-trans bills introduced across 49 states, these stories replace fear with understanding\u2014showcasing the strength and determination of the trans and nonbinary community.\nThe campaign highlights an inspiring array of individuals whose stories redefine what\u2019s possible:\nMila Jam, a Black trans woman and corporate advisor, shares: \u201cThere was a time when corporate doors were closed to people like me. Now, I\u2019m helping to build inclusive workplaces.\u201d\nAshton, a Gen Z advocate and GenderCool Champion, declares: \u201cWe are everywhere. We are the future.\u201d\nMore Than a Campaign\u2014It\u2019s a Movement \"Hear Us Out\" is just the beginning.

This exclusive program, designed to help disadvantaged businesses compete in the federal marketplace, offers significant advantages that drive growth, profitability, and long-term success. Here are 10 compelling reasons to pursue 8(a) certification:\nBenefit 1: Sole Sourcing\n8(a) firms can receive sole-source contracts, bypassing the traditional competitive bidding process. This streamlines procurement and can secure contracts before competitors are even aware of the opportunity. Sole-sourcing limits are set at $4.5 million for goods and services and $7 million for manufacturing. Often, established 8(a) firms can rely solely on sole-source contracts, reducing the need to participate in competitive bids.\nBenefit 2: Limited Competition\n8(a) certification significantly reduces competition for federal contracts. Out of approximately 24 million U.S. businesses, only around 6,500 have obtained 8(a) certification. The federal government allocates 5% of its annual contracting budget\u2014over $34 billion\u2014to 8(a) firms, equating to over $4 million per firm annually.\nBenefit 3: Streamlined Federal Contracting\nThe SBA serves as a liaison, facilitating introductions to federal agencies and reducing the time needed to secure contracts. This support helps 8(a) firms quickly establish relationships and win contracts.\nBenefit 4: Access to Large Contracts\nThrough joint ventures or mentor-prot\u00e9g\u00e9 arrangements, 8(a) firms can partner with other businesses, including large federal prime contractors. This enables access to contracts that would otherwise be unattainable and helps build performance history.\nBenefit 5: Pricing Advantages\nWith fewer competitors, 8(a) firms often command better pricing than non-8(a) small businesses.\nBenefit 6: Accelerated Growth\n8(a) firms experience faster growth, often appearing in lists of top federal IT contractors. The certification enables rapid expansion within federal markets.\nBenefit 7: Enhanced GSA Schedule Effectiveness\n8(a) certification amplifies the value of a GSA Schedule. Federal buyers prioritize 8(a) firms on GSA Advantage, providing a significant competitive edge.\nBenefit 8: Construction Contractor Success\n8(a) firms excel in federal construction contracts, with over 40% of 8(a) firms in the construction sector. The Department of Defense accounts for a significant portion of federal construction spending.\nBenefit 9: Emergency Response Opportunities\n8(a) firms are uniquely positioned to respond to FEMA and disaster recovery contracts, capitalizing on rapid sole-source awards. Over $11.5 billion is spent annually on disaster response, with many contracts awarded to 8(a) firms.\nBenefit 10: Transition to Large Business\nApproximately 30% of 8(a) firms leverage their government experience to become major federal prime contractors after graduating from the program, often achieving over $100 million in annual revenue.\n8(a) certification is a powerful tool that can unlock substantial growth opportunities, enhance market positioning, and secure long-term success in the federal marketplace. If you\u2019re ready to explore the benefits of 8(a) certification for your business, give us a call today. We\u2019re here to help you navigate the process and achieve your federal contracting goals!\nMark Ryan & Todd Luttenegger\n859-442-3300\nwww.ez8a.com\nez8a\n10500 Norbotten Dr\nFlorence Kentucky 41042\nUnited States \nYou are subscribed to this email as monica@lcwmail.com.\nClick here to modify your \npreferences\n or \nunsubscribe\n.",

It was a tough hearing \u2014 one marked by accusations of bias and calls to defund the very institutions that so many rely on for trusted, independent journalism.\nAt Chicago Public Media, we watched closely. And I want to speak plainly.\nPublic media isn\u2019t partisan. It\u2019s public.\nOur journalism is guided by a clear and unwavering code of ethics rooted in \naccuracy, fairness, independence and truth\n. These principles are not just words on a wall \u2014 they shape every story we report, every question we ask and how we show up for the Chicago community we serve. We are here to inform, so that you can decide. To listen deeply, elevate community voices and to report facts.\nWe believe journalism is a public trust, one protected by the First Amendment because a healthy democracy depends on an informed citizenry. That\u2019s why we work every day to make news and information accessible to all, especially those who are often left out of the conversation.\nThis work has never been easy. But it has never felt more important.\nChicago Public Media has always stood for something bigger than any one headline in the paper or story for the broadcast. We are here to strengthen civic life, hold power to account and amplify the diverse voices that make this region what it is. We are human-centered, empathetic and deeply rooted in our communities because journalism should reflect the people it serves.\nThat\u2019s why we\u2019re pushing forward: Because we know that in a time of rising polarization and growing distrust, the answer is not to shrink back \u2014 it's to lean in. To be even more transparent. Even more inclusive. Even more committed to the truth.\nWe are proud to be a member station of NPR. We stand with our colleagues across the country who believe that facts and fairness are essential and that the public deserves journalism that provides information free from commercial influence.\nThank you for believing in this mission alongside us. \nYour support isn\u2019t just helping fund a newsroom\n \n\u2014 it\u2019s helping protect a cornerstone of our democracy.\nOnwards,\nMelissa Bell\nCEO, Chicago Public Media\nMatching Gifts\nCar Donation\nGift of Securities\nPlanned Giving\n\u00a9Chicago Public Media Inc 848 East Grand Ave, Navy Pier Chicago, IL 60611 \nUnsubscribe from WBEZ Membership emails\nPlease do not reply to this email.

    "body": "Plus, national attention on the Wisconsin Supreme Court race. Here\u2019s what you need to know today.\n \n.\nTo view this email as a web page, click \nhere.\nMonday - March 31, 2025\nToday's \nRundown\n is brought to you by WBEZ members and\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\nby Bianca Cseke\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\nGood afternoon! It\u2019s Monday, and meteorologists expect more springtime \nstorms\n this week. Here\u2019s what else you need to know today.\n\u00a0 \n1.\nWith Chicago\u2019s mass transit system on the fiscal precipice, what solutions are on the table?\n\u00a0\nThe clock is ticking for state lawmakers to find more than $700 million for the CTA, Metra, Pace and Regional Transportation Authority before they run out of federal COVID-19 grants next year and resort to drastic cuts in service.\nState lawmakers remain focused on reforming Chicago mass transit. Yet legislators have all but refused to talk about immediate funding solutions, David Struett and \u00a0George Wiebe report for the Chicago Sun-Times.\nOne of the quickest options may be to redirect the state\u2019s federal highway funds to public transit in a process called \u201cflexing,\u201d though this would require approval from the Illinois Department of Transportation.\nLawmakers are also considering several taxes, including a progressive income tax, expanding the sales tax to cover services and a \u201croad usage charge\u201d based on how many miles motorists drive.\nMeanwhile, the RTA has suggested raising fares 10% across the board, netting $50 million in annual funding. However, this would only cover part of the budget gap, and opponents argue this plan would hurt low-income riders who rely on public transit the most. [\nChicago Sun-Times\n]\n2.\nOut-of-state donors have made the Wisconsin Supreme Court race the most expensive judicial election in U.S. history\n\u00a0\nAbortion rights, voting rights and the powers of public employee unions could all be in the balance at the state level in the court\u2019s future rulings, NPR reports.\nNationally, the court could determine whether Wisconsin redraws its congressional districts along lines that end up narrowing or ending the majority Republicans hold in the U.S. House.\nThis race would replace one of the four liberal-leaning judges on the seven-judge court for a 10-year term.\nWith so much at stake, donors have poured their support into the race, including Illinois Gov. JB Pritzker and billionaire Trump adviser \nElon Musk\n. The latter handed out $1 million to two people over the weekend after a legal back-and-forth on whether the money amounted to bribing voters.\nTomorrow\u2019s vote could be the first measure of Trump\u2019s popularity and Democrats\u2019 energy after the presidential election five months ago. It could also be a referendum on Musk, who has been pushing for \ndrastic cuts in the federal government\n through the so-called Department of Government Efficiency. [\nNPR\n]\nSPONSOR MESSAGE FROM\nNORTHWESTERN MCCORMICK SCHOOL OF ENGINEERING\nNorthwestern\u2019s MS in IT\nNorthwestern Engineering's MS in Information Technology program prepares students for the fast-paced challenges of senior IT leadership roles through a 70% technical and 30% business and management curriculum.\nJoin our online information session on April 8 to discover our unique blend of courses, diverse student body, and coursework. \nRegister here.\n3.\nDCFS repeatedly failed to produce critical reports required after kids\u2019 deaths or injuries\n\u00a0\nThe state agency responsible for keeping Illinois\u2019 most vulnerable children safe has failed to produce legally required public reports on hundreds of child deaths and thousands of serious injuries, an Illinois Answers Project investigation reports.\nMore than 1,200 deaths and more than 3,000 other cases of serious injury have met the criteria for \u201cincident-specific\u201d reports since July 2018, according to data the state Department of Children and Family Services released in response to a public records request.\nThose reports are required when a child dies as a result of suspected abuse or neglect, or if a child dies or suffers a serious injury while in the state\u2019s care.\nThe failure spurred criticism from child welfare advocates and prompted the Cook County public guardian to call for an investigation. [\nIllinois Answers Project\n]\n4.\nMayor Johnson named a longtime police oversight investigator as interim COPA chief administrator\n\u00a0\nMayor Brandon Johnson has picked an experienced police accountability investigator to temporarily lead Chicago\u2019s police oversight agency while the city conducts a nationwide search for the agency\u2019s next permanent leader, my colleague Kade Heather reports.\nLaKenya White was tabbed interim chief administrator for the Civilian Office of Police Accountability. She brings 25 years of experience in various police oversight roles, including eight years with COPA since the agency was created.\nWhite replaces Andrea Kersten, who resigned last month amid allegations of presiding over investigations with anti-police bias. [\nChicago Sun-Times\n]\n5.\nMichael Shannon, movie director, sinks into the dark aftermath of an American school shooting\n\u00a0\nThe actor swore he\u2019d never direct a movie \u2014 until playwright Brett Neveu, Shannon\u2019s friend and fellow Red Orchid Theatre ensemble member, handed him a script on the closing night of a play they did together in 2018.\nThe script was a screen adaptation of \nEric LaRue\n, a searing stage production about the aftermath of a school shooting, my colleague Courtney Kueppers reports for WBEZ.\nWhen Neveu originally wrote the play in 1998, the Columbine High School massacre in Colorado had not yet happened. Neither had the 2012 shooting at Connecticut\u2019s Sandy Hook Elementary, which left 26 people dead, mostly first graders. Nor had the one at Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School in Parkland, Florida (2018) or Robb Elementary in Uvalde, Texas (2022).\nOver the years, Neveu\u2019s prescient story of anguish has remained startlingly relevant. Now, Neveu and Shannon are hoping the movie adaptation \u2014 which unflinchingly lingers in the suffering of the survivors \u2014 will renew a conversation. [\nWBEZ\n]\n\u00a0\nHere's what else is happening\n\u00a0\nTrump said he is \u201cnot joking\u201d about pursuing a third term, though the Constitution says he can\u2019t serve. [\nNPR\n]\nStock markets fell worldwide as Trump\u2019s \u201cLiberation Day\u201d of tariffs approaches.

    "body": "Hello again JV Baseball Parents:\nWith a few games under our belts, it's time for a few updates.\u00a0\n1. We only heard from one parent about a food allergy for their player.\u00a0\nPlease let us know if your son has an allergy that we might have missed.\n2. Many of you wrote to say you prefer that we collect money up front and then have restaurant meals provided for the boys for as many games as possible. Given the large number of games on our schedule and\u00a0wanting to keep the\u00a0amount collected reasonable, we landed on $150 via Venmo or Zelle per family to cover our\u00a0\n18 school-night-away games\n;\u00a0\nthe thought being that for Horner Park and Saturday games, the boys can more easily manage food on their own. This\u00a0\nspreadsheet\n\u00a0lists all the game\u00a0times and locations. As Team Parents, we (Kelly, Andrea and Monica) will order the\u00a0meals for delivery to DCP 20 to 30 minutes before the bus takes off for the 18 school-night-away-games, and we'll supplement with bulk snacks. With that in mind:\nPlease send $150 to cover a meal to Kelly Fox via Venmo: @kelly-fox-38 or Zelle:\u00a0\nkellyfox99@gmail.com\n\u00a0 312-339-8697 -- \nOR IF YOU PREFER\nFeel free to\u00a0\nsign up\n\u00a0for a specific game, then drop off food to feed 24 (20 players + 4 staff)\u00a0\n20 minutes before bus is scheduled to depart DCP on the date you selected\n.\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\nIf you'd also like to contribute bulk purchased snacks (for example: a 50 bag box of chips, 5 lb bag of mandarin oranges, etc), you can drop them off this week with Andrea, Kelly or Monica at Horner Park games and we'll handle distribution at a future game.\u00a0\n3. Please also remind your son to use the free water fountains at school to refill their individual water bottles before games. This will not only help boys stay well-hydrated, but will also help avoid the trash (and cost) of dozens of plastic water/gatorade bottles per game.\n4. A big\u00a0thank you to\u00a0\nSuzanne Amaro,\u00a0\n\u00a0for producing laminated roster cards for each family (see attached). If you didn't get yours at last Saturday's game, please see her. It is awesome.\u00a0\n5.\u00a0\nJessica Castellanos\n\u00a0is setting up a group text chain for us. If you'd like to be included, please sign up here:\u00a0\nDePaul Parent JV Baseball Thread\n. It will be a great way to stay connected regarding any future last minute game location changes or weather delays, etc.\n6. Finally, a shout out to\u00a0\nRob Zumph and Nick Amaro\n\u00a0for the pop-up tailgate they planned last Saturday, when our game location switched to Kerry Wood Field. This was such a great idea, and we look forward to many more opportunities to gather over the season.\u00a0\nWe appreciate all of you who shared ideas for building on your past experiences as sports parents and making the season great.\u00a0\nPlease keep your ideas coming, and thanks in advance for just jumping in wherever and whenever your heart leads you this season.\u00a0\u00a0\n#GoRams\n2025 DCP JV Baseball Team Parents\u00a0\nKelly Fox 312 339 8697, Andre Gosz 312 731 2247, Monica Marcel 773 209 8447",

    "subject": "PWCC Monthly Newsletter - March 2025",
    "body": "Icebreaker, Member Spotlight, and Upcoming Events!\n\u200a\n \n\u200a\n \nHello!\nWelcome to PWCC\u2019s March newsletter! Explore this edition for details on upcoming events, ways to get involved, and special features highlighting you\u2014our valued PWCC members!\n \nIcebreaker\nEach month, we ask \nyou\n, our members, an icebreaker question and kick-off the newsletter by sharing a few selected answers from the previous month\u2019s question.\nLast month we asked:\nIs there a woman from history who has inspired you? Whether this historical figure made waves in the past or is making history now we\u2019d love to hear about it!\n\"Hetty Green was an incredible woman who became the wealthiest woman in America during the Gilded Age (1870s-1890s), even though women faced huge obstacles in business at the time. Laws often kept them from owning property or participating in financial markets. She had an incredible knack for investing and one of her most impressive moves was bailing out New York City in 1878 when it was on the brink of bankruptcy. Hetty\u2019s story shows that, despite the odds, women could and can achieve remarkable financial success through grit and smart decision-making.\u201d\nAlexia Jackson\n\u200b\u200bWealth Management Advisor, Merrill\n\u201cChoosing just one woman from history who has inspired me is a difficult task\u2014especially as someone with an MA in Public History who studied women who fought for agency in their time. There are countless stories that have moved and motivated me. But in honor of Women\u2019s History Month, I\u2019ll highlight a well-known figure who continues to inspire me: Eleanor Roosevelt.\nEleanor Roosevelt once said, 'Do what you feel in your heart to be right\u2014for you\u2019ll be criticized anyway.' She truly lived by those words. Born before women even had the right to vote, she emerged as a powerful political force in her own right. Long before it was common\u2014or accepted\u2014for women to hold office or speak publicly on major issues, Eleanor used her platform to champion civil rights, human rights, and women\u2019s equality. She wasn\u2019t afraid to speak her mind, even when it meant facing harsh criticism. In fact, she was often more popular\u2014and more controversial\u2014than her husband, President Franklin D. Roosevelt.\nWhat I admire most is her unwavering commitment to doing what she believed was right, no matter the opposition. That\u2019s a value I try to carry into my own life and work: to speak up, to stand firm, and to act with integrity, even when it\u2019s hard.\u201d\nMary DeMars\nDirector, Walk to End Alzheimer's\n\ufeff\u201cPrincess Diana was a true example of grace, elegance, and individuality. Princess Diana stood up for what she believed in and won the hearts of many - earning her the nickname 'The People's Princess.' Unafraid to break outdated Royal norms, she omitted the word 'obey' from her wedding vows, which was a long-standing Royal tradition. She had the biggest heart - not only for her two sons, but also for the hundreds of charities she supported. The world collectively mourned her passing in 1997 but her legacy truly lives on!\u201d\nJen Adams\nDirector of Development - Gratitude Generation\n\u201cI have been a nerd for women leaders since my dad gave me my first \nFortune's Most Powerful Women\n issue in high school, so it's hard to narrow it down! So, I could share a long list of women leaders who broke barriers.\nBut, the first one I remember is Amelia Bloomer. I wrote a paper on her and her 'bloomers' in 6th grade because I was fascinated by the fashion choice as much as how it was a bold statement of 'I will do what I want' for women to claim the freedom of moving easily in the world (unencumbered by heavy skirts).'\"\nCatherine Cassidy\nFounder & CEO\nThanks for sharing your responses!\u00a0\n \nTell us about yourself! Submit to the next newsletter\u2019s Icebreaker Question.\nNext month\u2019s icebreaker question: \nHow do you prepare for spring? Whether it\u2019s resetting your goals, spring cleaning, or getting out and enjoying the weather, we want to hear about it.\nTo submit your answers for the April newsletter, \nplease fill out this form\n by \nWednesday, April 23rd\n. We will select a few responses that we receive to feature in the next newsletter!\n \nEach month, we feature a member of PWCC! This month we\u2019re featuring PWCC member \nKaren Jones\n.\n \nMember Spotlight\nKaren Jones\u00a0\nRecently retired as a Senior Vice President, Private Client Advisor at Bank of America 4/1/25\nWhen did you join PWCC?\n\u00a0\n2005\nTell us about yourself. Your line of work? Your hobbies?\u00a0\nRetired after 40+ years of working with Fortune 100 firms, small businesses, individuals and families. Expertise in all areas of financial management, reporting, wealth preservation and planning, including investment strategies, trust services, custom credit solutions, philanthropy and private banking. Prior work experience included working with firms in Financial Management, Mergers and Acquisitions, Sales Management and Business Development. I have founded and developed two profitable start-up companies.\u00a0\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\nMy husband and I love to travel, spend time with family and friends, I enjoy a daily walk, bike vacations and hiking. Love contemporary art and meeting and supporting emerging artists!\n\u00a0\nAs a past president of PWCC,\u00a0what changes and goals did you work towards during your term? Were there any lessons learned during your time as president of PWCC?\nAs past president, I was very fortunate and grateful to work with an amazing board of professional women who are long time colleagues and dear friends. Bravo to the incredible leaders ahead of me that paved the road to success! We worked together to increase and retain membership by hard work, corporate sponsors, having an incredible lineup of speakers-kicked off year with Stephanie Izard, top chef and restaurant entrepreneur.\u00a0\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\nLessons learned: Working together as a team for a common goal in empowering women at every level or circumstance is incredibly rewarding both professionally and personally. Never underestimate the power of your network and lastly have fun!\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\n\u00a0\nHow do you stay motivated?\u00a0\nI am very fortunate to have a supportive husband, family and incredible coworkers and colleagues that support me. I stay motivated by living each day with purpose, faith, fun, laughter and helping each other.\u00a0\nSince time is a precious commodity, how do you make decisions about how to spend your time?\u00a0\nFamily first, prioritize your goals, make a daily list and if you don't finish move to the next day/week, etc. If you cannot commit to a task or endeavor it's OK to take a pass and move on.\u00a0\nIs there anything you are currently working on that you would like to share?\u00a0\nCurrently volunteering on three boards: 1: Endeavor (formerly NorthShore healthcare system) I am Chair of the Planned Giving Advisory Council, 2: Chicago Artists Coalition as Vice Chair and 3: St. Ignatius Business Society, Founding member and Membership Director.\u00a0I am currently seeking a paid board position with a few local Chicago based public and private firms.\nThanks to Karen for answering our questions.\n \n \nAre you interested in being featured in our newsletter?\n\ufeff\nIf you would like to be featured in the Member Spotlight section, please submit to our \nform\n \nfor consideration.\n \nDon't miss these upcoming events!\nWe have a ton of great events in April!

Miles will be credited to your account 8-12 weeks after you reach the Threshold Amount. Bonus Miles may appear on your account in more than one deposit. To receive the 110,000 bonus miles, your Card account must not be canceled or past due at the time of fulfillment. Eligible purchases can be made by the Basic Card Member and any Additional Card Members on a single Card account. Eligible purchases are purchases for goods and services minus returns and other credits. Eligible purchases to meet the spend requirement do NOT include fees or interest charges, cash advances, purchases of traveler's checks, purchases or reloading of prepaid cards, purchases of gift cards, person-to-person payments, or purchases of any cash equivalents. Additional Card Members on your account are not eligible for their own offer. In rare instances, your period to spend $12,000 may be shorter than 6 months if there is a delay in receiving your Card. Also, purchases may fall outside of the 6 month period in some cases, such as a delay in merchants submitting transactions to us or if the purchase date differs from the date you made the transaction. (For example, if you buy goods online, the purchase date may be the date the goods are shipped). This offer is not transferable. If your application is not received by 04/02/2025, we will not process your application even if we later receive your application. American Express reserves the right to modify or revoke offer at any time. \u00a0\u200b\nIf you have a history of cancelling or downgrading American Express Card accounts within your first year and you cancel or downgrade your new Card account within your first year, we may not credit, we may freeze, or we may take away the bonus miles from your account. If we determine that you have engaged in abuse, misuse, or gaming in connection with this offer in any way or that you intend to do so, including if you return purchases you made to meet the Threshold Amount, we may not credit, we may freeze, or we may take away the bonus miles from your account. We may also cancel any accounts you have with us.\u200b\n2\n. \nTakeOff 15\n:\nEligibility\n:\u200b\nBasic Delta SkyMiles Gold, Platinum and Reserve American Express Card Members, as well as Basic Delta SkyMiles Gold, Platinum and Reserve Business American Express Card Members (each, an \u201cEligible Card\u201d), can get at least a fifteen percent (15%) discount off the mileage portion of an Award Ticket (the \u201cTakeOff 15\u201d benefit). Additional Card Members are not eligible. \u200b\nAvailable only if entire itinerary is on Delta and Delta Connection\n\u00ae\n carrier-operated and ticketed flights booked at \ndelta.com \nor the FlyDelta app. Not available on flights operated by other carriers. Not available for Pay with Miles, Miles + Cash, seat upgrades purchased after the initial flight booking, or other Delta products or services. Discount only applies to the mileage portion of the Award Ticket fare and does not apply to applicable taxes and fees which must be paid using the Eligible Card. Card Member must be logged-in to a SkyMiles account linked to an Eligible Card to receive the TakeOff 15 benefit discount. Mileage discount will be greater than or equal to 15% of the overall miles portion for the Award Ticket. An Award Ticket is a ticket issued by Delta pursuant to the SkyMiles Program Rules, by which SkyMiles members may redeem miles and pay applicable government-imposed taxes and fees in exchange for air transportation. All Award Ticket rules apply, as set forth on \ndelta.com\n and in the specific terms incorporated into your Award Ticket. Award Travel is defined as travel using an Award Ticket. Award Travel seats are limited and may not be available on all flights or in all markets.\u200b\nSkyMiles account balance must have sufficient miles for the entire Award Ticket(s) being purchased. TakeOff 15 benefit is not combinable with certificates, Delta eCredits, Delta Gift Cards, vouchers, or with any other discounts or promotional offers.\u00a0\nAward Ticket Taxes/Fees\n:\u200b\nAward Ticket taxes and fees include only U.S. excise and departure/arrival taxes, airport charges, segment fees, the September 11th Security Fee, and international taxes and fees normally included in the Award Ticket. \u200b\nAward Ticket Cancellations and Changes\n:\u200b\nIn the event of a voluntary cancellation of the Award Ticket to which the TakeOff 15 benefit was applied, redeemed miles will be redeposited into the Card Member\u2019s SkyMiles account, except for Basic Economy tickets. Current Award Ticket redeposit fees apply. Basic Economy cancellations will result in cancellation charge assessed in miles, as outlined in fare rules. Remaining miles after deduction of the cancellation charge will be redeposited to Card Member\u2019s SkyMiles account. There is no discount applicable to the cancellation charge. \u00a0\u200b\nIf changing an Award Ticket after ticketing, discount is applied to the new Award Ticket (if eligible), and the difference in miles will be deducted from the Card Member\u2019s SkyMiles account (if the new Award Ticket mileage amount is higher) or redeposited into the Card Member\u2019s SkyMiles account (if the new Award Ticket mileage amount is lower). Basic Economy tickets are not eligible for voluntary changes.

We highly recommend that you read our complete legal information below, because that's the one that really counts. (Plus, who doesn't enjoy reading a good, long Terms of Service now and again?) If you just want the highlights \u2013 or spoilers, as the legal team likes to think of them \u2013 here are a few of the most important bits, in plain English. You still own all the pictures you order from us. You keep the copyright to all of your images. We won\u2019t sell them, share them, or use them for anything other than getting your tiles printed and delivered to you. We need access to your photo gallery to show you your pictures in the Mixtiles app. When you open our app for the first time, it\u2019ll ask you for permission to access your photos. We need that so we can let you select, crop, and order your pics in our app. If you want, you can turn that permission off in your settings later or delete the app to remove the permission. If you want, we\u2019ll delete all your pictures and personal data from our systems. All you need to do is send us an email to from the email address you entered when you made your order. You agree not to order any pictures you don\u2019t own, or any pornography or discriminatory content. There are lots of people involved in the printing process, so we can\u2019t print any images with nudity or offensive content.

If you do send us a picture that doesn't belong to you and we are sued by the rightful owner, you'll be responsible for all related costs. If there\u2019s a problem with your tiles or if there are any other issues, just send us an email to... or a chat through the app. We\u2019ll do our best to get it all sorted out.In connection with your purchase of a Tile through the Services, you will be asked to provide customary billing information such as name, billing address and credit card information either to Mixtiles or its third-party payment processor(s).

    "subject": "Real Estate Commission Lawsuits \u2013 New Settlements Reached",
    "body": "If you sold a home and paid a commission to a real estate agent, you \nmay\n be a part of class action Settlements \n \nPROPOSED SETTLEMENTS WITH ALL DEFENDANTS TOTAL OVER\n \n$1 BILLION\n \nA federal court authorized this Notice. \nPara una notificaci\u00f3n en espa\u00f1ol, visite \nwww.RealEstateCommissionLitigation.com\n. \nWhat is this lawsuit about? \nThis Notice is to inform you that proposed Settlements have been reached with Keyes, Illustrated, NextHome, John L. Scott, LoKation, Real Estate One, and Baird & Warner in a lawsuit known as \nGibson, et al. v. The National Association of Realtors, et al.\n, Case No. 23-CV-788-SRB (W.D. Mo.) (\"\nGibson\n\") and with Side, Seven Gables, WFP, JPAR, Signature, First Team, Sibcy Cline, Brooklyn MLS, and CNYIS in a lawsuit known as \nKeel, et al. v. Washington Fine Properties LLC, et al.,\n (W.D. Mo. Case No. 4:25-CV-00055-SRB) (\"\nKeel\n\"). The lawsuits allege the existence of an anticompetitive agreement that resulted in home sellers paying inflated commissions to real estate brokers or agents in violation of antitrust law. Proposed Settlements have also been reached with other Defendants in related lawsuits. \nAll Defendants in the lawsuits are listed at \nwww.RealEstateCommissionLitigation.com\n. \nHow do I know if I am a part of the Settlements?\n \nYou are a Settlement Class Member and eligible for payment if you: (1) sold a home during the Eligible Date Range; (2) listed the home that was sold on a multiple listing service (\"MLS\") anywhere in the United States; and (3) paid a commission to any real estate brokerage in connection with the sale of the home. The term \"MLS\" encompasses all NAR and non-NAR MLSs. The Eligible Date Range depends on which state or MLS you listed your home for sale on. Go to \nwww.RealEstateCommissionLitigation.com\n to see the Eligible Date Range and to learn more. \nWhat do the Settlements provide? \nThe \nGibson\n Settling Defendants named here have agreed to pay, collectively, over \n$8 million\n into a Settlement Fund and the \nKeel\n Settling Defendants named here over \n$11.4 million\n. The current value of \nall\n proposed Settlements with these and other Defendants is over \n$1 billion\n. The Fund will be distributed to qualifying Settlement Class Members who submit an approved Claim Form, after any awarded attorneys\u2019 fees, expenses, Settlement Administration costs, and service awards have been deducted. Settling Defendants have also agreed to implement Practice Changes and provide Cooperation. \nYou can learn more about the Practice Changes and Cooperation in the Settlement Agreements, available at \nwww.RealEstateCommissionLitigation.com\n. \nHow do I get a payment? \nNote: If you have already submitted a Claim Form in this case for a prior Settlement with other Defendants, you do not need to submit another Claim. \nYou must submit a Claim Form with information pertaining to and/or evidence of your home sale and commissions paid, by \nMay 9, 2025\n. Claim Forms can be submitted online at \nwww.RealEstateCommissionLitigation.com\n. \nYou can also print a Claim Form at the website and mail it to Real Estate Commission Litigation Settlements, c/o JND Legal Administration, PO Box 91479, Seattle, WA 98111, or email it to \ninfo@RealEstateCommissionLitigation.com\n. \nWhat are my other options? \nYou may object to or exclude yourself (opt-out) from the Settlements by \nMay 9, 2025\n, or do nothing. If you \nexclude yourself\n, you will \nnot\n receive a Settlement Payment, but this is the only option that allows you to sue the Settling Defendants named here, and their Released Parties, relating to commission prices. If you wish to \nobject\n, the Court will consider your views in deciding whether to approve or reject the proposed Settlements. If the Court does not approve the Settlements, no Settlement Payments will be sent, and the lawsuit will continue. You cannot object if you opt-out. By \ndoing nothing\n, you will get no payment, and you will not be able to sue the Settling Defendants relating to commission prices. \nFor more information, including how to object or exclude yourself and to read the full terms of the release, visit \nwww.RealEstateCommissionLitigation.com\n. \nWhat happens next? \nThe Court will hold a hearing on \nJune 24, 2025\n to consider whether to grant Final Approval of the Settlements and award fees and costs to the attorneys representing the class (\u201cClass Counsel\u201d). The Court has appointed the law firms of Ketchmark and McCreight; Williams Dirks Dameron; Boulware Law; Hagens Berman Sobol Shapiro; Cohen Milstein Sellers & Toll; and Susman Godfrey as Class Counsel. Class Counsel will ask the Court to award an amount not to exceed one-third (33.3%) of the Settlement Funds, plus out-of-pocket expenses incurred during the case. The Court may award less. Class Counsel will also seek compensation for each current and/or former Class Representative. You will be represented by Class Counsel at the hearing unless you choose to enter an appearance in person or through your own lawyer, at your own cost, or unless you choose to object or opt-out of the Settlements. The appearance of your own attorney is not necessary to participate in the hearing. \nQuestions? \nThis Notice is only a summary. To learn more, visit \nwww.RealEstateCommissionLitigation.com\n, call toll-free \n888-995-0207\n, email \ninfo@RealEstateCommissionLitigation.com\n, or write Real Estate Commission Litigation Settlements, c/o JND Legal Administration, PO Box 91479, Seattle, WA 98111. \nTo unsubscribe from this list, please click on the following link: \nunsubscribe",

When icy missions called, Bond relied on Q's genius modifications to his classic cars, like his winterized Aston Martin V8 with ski-like outriggers and studded tires used in 1987\u2019s \nThe Living Daylights\n. These studs act like cleats for snow, breaking through packed ice to provide better control. The V8's outriggers, replicating ice skates, are perfect for sliding and leaping over frozen terrain.\nScientists believe that the pressure of skates pushing into ice is constantly creating a liquid-solid mix, which reduces the friction and allows the skater to slide, turn and stop. This principle inspired Bond's epic frozen lake escape in his V8. \u00a0\nDon\u2019t miss your chance to see the V8 up close and explore more science behind the gadgets and stunts in the Bond franchise in \n007 Science: Inventing the World of James Bond\n \u2013 closing April 6.\nLearn More About 007 Science\n \n\u00a0 \n\u00a0 \n \n\u00a0 \n\u00a0 \n\u00a0 \n\u00a0 \n\u00a0\n\u00a0 \n \n \n \n \n \n\u00a0 \nGriffin Museum of Science and Industry \n5700 S.

As such, we strive to adhere to the Web Content Accessibility Guidelines (\u201cWCAG\u201d) 2.0 Levels A and AA, a set of guidelines developed by the World Wide Web Consortium and used to ensure that digital content is accessible to everyone. We also work with advocacy groups, accessibility and usability consultants, and persons with disabilities to make sure that our website and mobile applications function properly. We are always learning and looking for ways to improve accessibility. Here are some steps we\u2019ve taken to improve access to our website and mobile applications: Text Equivalents: We provide alternative text detail for appropriate images and other non-text elements. Full Keyboard Access: Our website is built so that it can be accessed using a keyboard. Site Consistency: We are consistent in the way we build our website and mobile applications so that they function the same way every time you interact with them. Site Structure: We use appropriate headings, lists, paragraphs, style sheets and other formatting features so that guests can easily use the website with assistive technology. Links: Many links have title attributes which describe the link in greater detail, unless the text of the link already fully describes the target.If you have any feedback or questions regarding our website....Mixtiles Terms of Service Here\u2019s an overview of our terms. We highly recommend that you read our complete legal information below, because that's the one that really counts. (Plus, who doesn't enjoy reading a good, long Terms of Service now and again?) If you just want the highlights \u2013 or spoilers, as the legal team likes to think of them \u2013 here are a few of the most important bits, in plain English. You still own all the pictures you order from us. You keep the copyright to all of your images. We won\u2019t sell them, share them, or use them for anything other than getting your tiles printed and delivered to you. We need access to your photo gallery to show you your pictures in the Mixtiles app. When you open our app for the first time, it\u2019ll ask you for permission to access your photos. We need that so we can let you select, crop, and order your pics in our app. If you want, you can turn that permission off in your settings later or delete the app to remove the permission. If you want, we\u2019ll delete all your pictures and personal data from our systems. All you need to do is send us an email to from the email address you entered when you made your order. You agree not to order any pictures you don\u2019t own, or any pornography or discriminatory content. There are lots of people involved in the printing process, so we can\u2019t print any images with nudity or offensive content. We also can\u2019t print pictures that you don\u2019t have the right to use. If you do send us a picture that doesn't belong to you and we are sued by the rightful owner, you'll be responsible for all related costs. If there\u2019s a problem with your tiles or if there are any other issues, just send us an email to... or a chat through the app. We\u2019ll do our best to get it all sorted out.In connection with your purchase of a Tile through the Services, you will be asked to provide customary billing information such as name, billing address and credit card information either to Mixtiles or its third-party payment processor(s). You agree to pay Mixtiles the Fee as set forth in the App during the purchase process for any confirmed transactions made in connection with your account in accordance with these Terms by one of the methods described on the App. You hereby authorize the collection of such amounts by charging the credit card provided, either directly by Mixtiles or indirectly, via a third-party online payment processor or by one of the payment methods described on the App. If you are directed to a third-party payment processor(s), you may be subject to terms and conditions governing use of that third party's service and that third party's Personal Data collection practices.

    "body": "Plus, shedding light on a promised immersive exhibit at Navy Pier. Here\u2019s what you need to know today.\n \n.\nTo view this email as a web page, click \nhere.\nFriday - March 28, 2025\nToday's \nRundown\n is brought to you by WBEZ members\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\nby Bianca Cseke\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\nGood afternoon! It\u2019s Friday, and the only perk of having jetlag all week was watching last night\u2019s \nlightning\n. Here\u2019s what you need to know today.\n\u00a0 \n1.\nThe CTU and CPS have a potential contract deal, sources say\n\u00a0\nLeaders of the Chicago Teachers Union and Chicago Public Schools have reached a possible agreement that will go to a union committee for approval on Monday, my colleagues Sarah Karp and Nader Issa report.\nA settlement had been within reach for a couple weeks, and a final few days of talks this week \u2014 including a late-night session on Wednesday \u2014 helped the two sides reach the finish line. If the terms are approved, this will bring an end to almost a year of tense negotiations.\nCTU leaders plan to take the proposed package to their \u201cbig bargaining team\u201d \u2014 a group of a couple dozen educators who have helped negotiate the contract \u2014 for approval. That team will decide whether to recommend the package to the union\u2019s 730-member House of Delegates. A final ratification vote by the CTU\u2019s 30,000 members would seal the deal.\nThis would be the first time the CTU has landed a contract without a strike vote in the 15 years under the union\u2019s current leadership.\nThe union ultimately decided to accept the salary offer put forward in the summer of 4% cost-of-living increases in each of the four years of the contract. The district also promised to hire 30 librarians over each of the next three years.\u00a0\n[\nWBEZ/Chicago Sun-Times\n]\n2.\nSixteen new speed cameras are being installed near Chicago schools and parks\n\u00a0\nSpeed cameras installed at 16 new locations will begin doling out warning notices on April Fool\u2019s Day, but it\u2019s no joke, my colleague Fran Spielman reports.\nTicketing for motorists driving too fast near schools and parks will begin on May 15. That\u2019s after a 30-day warning period, followed by a two-week \u201cblack-out period\u201d to make certain drivers receive any warning in the mail before citations are issued.\nNear schools, enforcement hours are between 7 a.m. and 7 p.m. Monday through Friday on school days. The speed limit is 20 mph when children are present and the posted speed limit when no children are present.\nCameras installed near parks will trigger warning notices and tickets when each park is open, which is normally 6 a.m. to 11 p.m. seven days a week.\nThe 16 cameras are the first of 50 that Mayor Brandon Johnson vowed to install to generate $11.4 million in 2025 \u2014 part of the compromise plan to balance his narrowly approved 2025 budget after the City Council balked at raising property taxes. You can see the full list of locations in the link.

His administration has been accused by civil rights advocates of disobeying a court order that sought to halt the deportation flights.\nIn Chicago, where gangs have long been the targets of sweeping federal investigations, police sources told the Chicago Sun-Times that Tren de Aragua\u2019s operations and reach aren\u2019t clear.\nAlmost all the 37 men flagged by Chicago police as possible members have faced only drug charges and citations for driving infractions, my colleagues Tom Schuba, Frank Main and Elvia Malag\u00f3n report.\nMany of the men are from Venezuela, where the prison gang started, or Colombia, Honduras and Ecuador \u2014 countries where the gang reportedly has spread. Police have used the men\u2019s tattoos, clothing and a car decal to link them to the gang, citing law enforcement alerts detailing its iconography. Arrest reports reviewed by the Sun-Times show only one man whose tattoo is considered a symbol of the gang.\nFederal officials have connected two reputed Tren de Aragua members to high-profile shootings in Chicago, but they haven\u2019t been charged in the attacks. [\nChicago Sun-Times\n]\n4.\nThe transformation of a historic Loop office building into housing has begun\n\u00a0\nThe 14-story building at 79 W. Monroe St. is part of the city\u2019s La Salle Corridor Revitalization initiative, bringing more than 1,000 new apartments to the Loop after the pandemic hiked office vacancy levels, my colleague Abby Miller reports for the Chicago Sun-Times.\nThe property \u2014 formerly known as the Bell Federal Savings & Loan Building, now called the Rector Building \u2014 was built in 1905. It\u2019s the oldest surviving commercial tower designed by architect Jarvis Hunt. The building was also given landmark status by the Chicago City Council on March 12.\nOnce completed, the residential tower will offer 117 units, including 41 affordable. Floors seven through 13 will include apartments, according to Housing Department Commissioner Lissette Castaneda. The lower floors are currently occupied by a charter school and a Walgreens. [\nChicago Sun-Times\n]\n5.\nNavy Pier claims a bait and switch on an immersive exhibit at Crystal Gardens\n\u00a0\nThe owners of Navy Pier say entertainment company Illuminarium broke its promise to build a $30 million \u201cstate of the art\u201d immersive sensory experience and instead created a \u201crun-of-the-mill virtual reality exhibit,\u201d Kade Heather reports for the Chicago Sun-Times.\nIn 2021, Illuminarium entered a 10-year lease agreement with NPI, the nonprofit that operates Navy Pier, to build what it described as a \u201ccutting edge immersive experience unlike anything most people have ever experienced,\u201d according to a lawsuit filed by NPI last week in Cook County circuit court.\nBut after the lease agreement, Illuminarium said its finances had worsened because of the pandemic and it would need to raise money to create the larger attraction. In January, Illuminarium allegedly told Navy Pier operators it decided to use Crystal Gardens for a walk-around virtual reality experience, rather than its initial proposal.\n\u201cMost certainly, NPI did not agree, and would never have agreed, to commit the iconic Crystal Garden to Illuminarium for a period of at least ten years if Illuminarium intended to use the space for a virtual reality exhibit,\u201d the suit says. [\nChicago Sun-Times\n]\n\u00a0\nHere's what else is happening\n\u00a0\nA major earthquake killed at least 150 people and injured hundreds more in Myanmar and Thailand. [\nNPR\n]\nTwo major law firms, including Chicago-based Jenner & Block, sued the Trump administration over executive orders targeting them. [\nNPR\n]\nThe biggest reveals in a new Yoko Ono biography include her mental health struggles and John Lennon's infidelity. [\nUSA Today\n]\nLongtime DePaul women's basketball coach Doug Bruno announced his retirement. [\nAP\n]\n\u00a0\nOh, and one more thing...\n\u00a0\nChicago-based singer and songwriter Isabel Olive released her third album today.\nIn \nCosmovisi\u00f3n\n, the Venezuelan American singer known as Half Gringa deploys complex melodies and ruminative lyrics to explore themes like climate change and her dual heritage.\nShe spoke to WBEZ\u2019s Mary Dixon before a recent performance at our studios; you can listen to the interview and read highlights in the link, including Olive\u2019s desire to give migrants and their children hope through her music. [\nWBEZ\n]\n\u00a0\nTell me something good\n\u00a0\nI was just in India and saw the Taj Mahal, and it absolutely lived up to the hype as one of the most beautiful buildings in the world. That has me wondering, what\u2019s something that left you in awe while traveling, whether it\u2019s an iconic landmark or a unique experience?\nRich writes:\n\u201cThe forest of Giant Sequoias in California\u2019s Kings Canyon NP. I felt so small hiking alone early one morning under their 30-storey canopies, and so insignificant facing these 3000 year-old testaments to Nature\u2019s endurance. I cried tears of joy to be among them.\u201d\nJen writes:\n\u201cSeeing the great migration of Sandhill Cranes through Central Nebraska always fills me with awe! It is absolutely gorgeous to see the spectacle of these birds returning to the Platte River at dusk or flying off in search of food at dawn. I am so grateful to be in Nebraska now to see some of the about 700,000 cranes currently in the area. Sandhill Cranes have been flying through this part of the world for over 2 million years. In that time, so much has changed, but the cranes have been resilient and adapted along the way. Seeing the crane migration gives me so much hope and helps me connect to the people around me and the larger natural world.\u201d\nAnd Ed writes:\n\u201cI would have to go with the Gaudi architectural sites in Barcelona. We saw La Sagrada Familia and Parc Guell in the same afternoon. The former is rightfully lauded for its majesty and intricate architectural features, but the latter \u2014 while not as grand \u2014 was even more aggressive. The bright colors and swirling shapes of the buildings, gardens and plazas dotting this one-time estate made me feel like I was walking through the board of the children\u2019s game Candy Land.\u201d\nThanks for all the responses this week! I could only publish a handful of them, but it was great hearing about your experiences and adding to my bucket list.\nThanks for reading and have a nice weekend! I'll see you on Monday.\n\u2014 Bianca Cseke\nThe Rundown is reader-funded.\u00a0\nYour gift of any amount helps power this newsletter and all of WBEZ\u2019s reporting.\u00a0\nDONATE TODAY\n\u00a9Chicago Public Media Inc 848 East Grand Ave, Navy Pier Chicago, IL 60611\nUnsubscribe\u00a0from The Daily Rundown\n\u00a0| \nPrivacy Policy",

Here\u2019s what you need to know today.\n \n.\nTo view this email as a web page, click \nhere.\nThursday - March 27, 2025\nToday's \nRundown\n is brought to you by WBEZ members and\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\nby Bianca Cseke\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\nGood afternoon! It\u2019s Thursday \u2014 and Opening Day for the \nWhite Sox\n and \nCubs\n. Here\u2019s what else you need to know today.\n\u00a0 \n1.\nThe Trump administration cut $153 million in Illinois public health and substance abuse programs\n\u00a0\nThe cuts are part of $12 billion in grants the federal \nDepartment of Health and Human Services\n canceled across the country this week, citing the end of the COVID-19 pandemic, my colleagues Tina Sfondeles and Mitchell Armentrout report.\nState officials said they learned this week of $28 million in previously approved grants that have been slashed from the Illinois Department of Human Services, while $125 million has been pulled back from the state Department of Public Health.\nThe Trump administration is also blocking another $324 million in future public health department grants Illinois had been set to receive under the CARES Act, passed by Congress during Trump\u2019s first term in the early days of the COVID-19 pandemic.\n\u201cIf allowed to stand, this funding cut will set back critical upgrades to our public health labs, technology used to track infectious diseases like H5N1 avian flu and measles, vaccination efforts and our ongoing work to better prepare for the next public health emergency,\u201d IDPH Director Dr. Sameer Vohra said.\nThe money also helped support behavioral health crisis responses, substance abuse recovery homes and prevention services, and assistance for people experiencing early symptoms of psychosis. [\nChicago Sun-Times\n]\n2.\nA DePaul class inside Cook County Jail brings together incarcerated and traditional students\n\u00a0\nInside-Out is a program taught in hundreds of jails and prisons across the country, and its DePaul University class this quarter is about homelessness, WBEZ contributor Charlotte West reports.\n\u201cThere are deeply embedded societal beliefs about unhoused neighbors, just as there are assumptions about people impacted by the carceral system,\u201d said Jen Kouba, an adjunct professor of peace, justice and conflict studies. \u201cAnd the inside students are the first to acknowledge that they had assumptions about me and the outside DePaul students.\u201d\nMolly, an outside student in the group and a journalism major, said she often talks about issues like homelessness and the prison system at school, but those often feel separate from students\u2019 reality on campus.\nTaking a class at the jail has made those topics much more real. As a future journalist, \u201cbeing able to talk to people from so many different backgrounds is really helpful,\u201d Molly said. [\nWBEZ\n]\nSPONSOR MESSAGE FROM WOODLANDS ACADEMY\nWe Are Woodlands Academy: Girls Thrive Here\nWoodlands Academy of the Sacred Heart\n\u2014a Catholic, independent, college-preparatory day and boarding high school for girls\u2014consistently ranks as the \n#1 all-girls high school in Illinois.\nWith a 100% focus on the education, development, and well-being of young women, Woodlands is inspiring the next generation of leaders.\nWoodlands Academy is now accepting applications for the 2025-2026 school year. Visit \nwoodlandsacademy.org.\n3.\nChicago will waive late fees and back charges on vehicle stickers next month\n\u00a0\nAs part of the Office of the City Clerk\u2019s Amnesty Month, residents will be able to buy stickers for their motorbikes, cars and trucks without late fees or back charges, Block Club Chicago reports.\nLate fees for vehicle stickers or renewals are usually $60, or $30 for qualified seniors. Chicagoans are required to purchase stickers within 30 days of moving to the city if they own a vehicle or within 30 days of buying one.\nThis year\u2019s annual stickers cost $53.04 for motorbikes, $100.17 to $159.12 for passenger vehicles and $235.71 to $530.40 for trucks. [\nBlock Club Chicago\n]\nHere\u2019s a list of all locations where you can purchase a sticker. [\nOffice of the City Clerk\n]\n4.\nChicago cops get dressed down over their sloppy appearance\n\u00a0\nChicago Police Department leaders are cracking down on the appearance of some district officers who could face reprimands, according to an internal email sent out this week by a police leader and obtained by my Chicago Sun-Times colleagues.\nSupervisors and officers were told to shave their stubble, wear neutral nail polish colors and avoid \u201cfaddish\u201d haircuts. Those out of step were threatened with discipline.\n\u201cThe department has had appearance standards forever,\u201d said John Catanzara, president of the Fraternal Order of Police Chicago Lodge 7. \u201cThe superintendent [Larry Snelling] made it very clear that was going to be one of his main motivations or focuses coming in.\u201d [\nChicago Sun-Times\n]\n5.\nFuture, Young Thug, Don Toliver and Yeat will headline Lyrical Lemonade\u2019s Summer Smash Festival\n\u00a0\nOther performers set for the three-day weekend, which runs June 20\u201322 at Bridgeview\u2019s SeatGeek Stadium, include Sexyy Red, Lil Yachty, Soulja Boy and Quavo.\nThe festival, one of hip-hop\u2019s largest showcases, also spotlights Chicago hometown heroes G Herbo, Saba, Famous Dex and Chance The Rapper.\nTickets and parking passes go on sale at noon tomorrow at \nthesummersmash.com\n and the DICE mobile app. Installment payment options are also available. Single-day ticket sales will be announced at a later date. [\nChicago Sun-Times\n]\n\u00a0\nHere's what else is happening\n\u00a0\nPresident Donald Trump placed a 25% tariff on imported vehicles, expecting to raise $100 billion in tax revenues but worrying automakers who rely on global supply chains. [\nAP\n]\nAt least six people died after a submarine carrying tourists on a reef tour in the Red Sea sank off Egypt\u2019s coast. [\nAP\n]\nIllinois Sen. Dick Durbin is under fire from progressives over voting for the GOP spending plan. [\nChicago Sun-Times\n]\nChicago immigrant advocates blasted a leaked draft of the Trump administration\u2019s travel ban. [\nChicago Sun-Times\n]\n\u00a0\nOh, and one more thing...\n\u00a0\nChicago indie band Free Range\u2019s forthcoming second album explores themes of growing up, all while showcasing a band maturing into form, WBEZ contributor Andrew Meriwether writes.\nLost & Found\n, out tomorrow on Mick Music, comes a little over a year after \nPractice\n, Free Range\u2019s first full-length record.\nPractice \nwas created in bits and pieces, in a very DIY fashion. Much was done in apartments or basements, with bandmates Jack Henry and Sofia Jensen learning how to record and mix as they went. The effort took two and half years.\nThe creation of \nLost & Found\n couldn\u2019t have been more different. Free Range partnered with musician and producer Tommy Reed, who runs a studio called Lazy Bones in rural Silsbee, Texas. That focused creative period was integral not only to the quality of the recordings but also formation of a band identity. [\nWBEZ\n]\n\u00a0\nTell me something good\n\u00a0\nI was just in India and saw the Taj Mahal, and it absolutely lived up to the hype as one of the most beautiful buildings in the world. That has me wondering, what\u2019s something that left you in awe while traveling, whether it\u2019s an iconic landmark or a unique experience?\nJonathan writes:\n\u201cIguazu Falls at the Argentine-Brazilian border. Immortalized in the 1986 film, The Mission (which has an amazing soundtrack), the real thing was even more amazing.\u201d\nSandra writes:\n\u201cOne of the most amazing sites I visited was the Cistern in Istanbul, surprising mostly because I was just not expecting a cistern to be an amazing site. It was an example of ancient Roman engineering, with giant columns with huge upside-down Medusa heads at the bases. Why they thought to put beautifully carved columns at the bottom of a cistern is beyond me. Perhaps they knew that in a couple thousand years, it would no longer serve as a water source, and would be an incredible tourist attraction, complete with a light-and-sound exhibit and a small cafe.\u201d\nAnd Tony writes:\n\u201cOne of the only times I had my breath taken away was the first time I saw Flamenco beach on the island of Culebra, part of PR. Friends moved there from Chicago and the first time I visited they had to show me one of the reasons why they would sell all their belongings and leave a 2 bedroom in Ravenswood to a Caribbean island. I am not a beach person but when I walked up and saw the view, I literally had my breath taken away.\u201d\nFeel free to email me, and your response may be included in the newsletter this week.\nThanks for reading and have a nice night! I'll see you tomorrow.\n\u2014 Bianca Cseke\nThe Rundown is reader-funded.\u00a0\nYour gift of any amount helps power this newsletter and all of WBEZ\u2019s reporting.\u00a0\nDONATE TODAY\n\u00a9Chicago Public Media Inc 848 East Grand Ave, Navy Pier Chicago, IL 60611\nUnsubscribe\u00a0from The Daily Rundown\n\u00a0| \nPrivacy Policy",

This authenticity fosters both professional collaboration and personal connection, challenging the assumption that in-person work is necessary for strong workplace bonds.\nWhile companies argue that physical proximity drives creativity and collaboration, many employees remain resistant, citing better work-life balance, increased productivity, and reduced stress when working remotely. Experts suggest that RTO policies should be task-based, allowing flexibility where possible rather than enforcing blanket mandates.\nDr. Gleb\u2019s Take\nThe data is clear: forcing employees back to the office under the illusion that it strengthens relationships is a leadership failure. Authentic connections aren\u2019t built in conference rooms\u2014they\u2019re built through trust, autonomy, and respect. This study proves that remote work doesn\u2019t weaken relationships; it makes them more human.\nCompanies clinging to outdated in-office models aren\u2019t promoting collaboration\u2014they\u2019re asserting control. The future of work is hybrid, flexible, and results-driven. Businesses that embrace this will thrive. Those that don\u2019t will bleed talent to smarter competitors.\n\u201c\nLocal Heterogeneity in Artificial Intelligence Jobs Over Time and Space\n\u201d (SSRN)\nSummary\nThis study analyzes how AI-related job opportunities have evolved across U.S. counties between 2014 and 2023. While traditional tech hubs like Santa Clara, CA, remain dominant, surprising growth has emerged in suburban and remote-friendly areas such as Maries, MO, and Hughes, SD\u2014particularly in the post-lockdown era.\nKey factors driving AI job adoption include a higher concentration of STEM graduates, a tight labor market, and strong patent activity. Conversely, regions with heavy manufacturing and high employee turnover see slower AI adoption. The findings highlight how AI\u2019s economic benefits are unevenly distributed, emphasizing the role of local education, innovation, and labor market conditions. The paper also suggests that place-based policies could help attract AI talent and investments, reducing regional disparities.\nDr. Gleb\u2019s Take\nThe AI job market isn\u2019t just about Silicon Valley anymore\u2014it\u2019s decentralizing, and fast. This study confirms that suburban and remote-friendly regions are becoming unexpected winners in AI job growth. The message for policymakers is clear: if you want to compete in the AI economy, invest in STEM education and innovation incentives now, and support remote work.\nManufacturing-heavy regions resisting AI adoption and opposing remote work are setting themselves up for long-term economic decline. The future belongs to remote-friendly areas that embrace AI, not just as a tool, but as a driver of regional economic transformation. Place-based policies aren\u2019t optional; they\u2019re a necessity for staying competitive in the AI-driven world.\n\u201c\nWhat\u2019s the Goal of the Goal?\n\u201d (Behavioral Scientist)\nSummary\nThis article explores how focusing on short-term metrics can sometimes undermine an organization\u2019s true mission. It illustrates this with several examples, including a car dealership aggressively pressuring customers for high satisfaction scores\u2014so much so that it turned a positive buying experience into a frustrating ordeal. The dealership\u2019s goal should have been to improve customer satisfaction, but instead, they prioritized gaming the rating system.\nAnother example involves Eurostar\u2019s decision to spend 6 billion GBP to cut travel time between London and Paris by 20 minutes. While this technically met their goal, it ignored the bigger question: was this the best way to improve passenger experience? Alternatives like Wi-Fi or enhanced service could have been cheaper and more effective.\nThe article also discusses a government program to help disabled veterans get student loan forgiveness. Initially, the goal was to increase application rates, but after stepping back and asking \u201cWhat\u2019s the goal of the goal?\u201d officials realized they could eliminate the application process altogether\u2014dramatically improving efficiency and veterans\u2019 financial security.\nUltimately, the piece argues that before pursuing any goal, leaders should ask: \u201cWhat\u2019s the bigger purpose?\u201d This approach can prevent wasted effort and uncover simpler, more impactful solutions.\nDr. Gleb\u2019s Take\nThis article nails a fundamental leadership failure: chasing arbitrary metrics instead of real impact. Too many organizations mistake numbers for progress, blindly optimizing for a flawed target. Whether it\u2019s forcing customers into fake high ratings, spending billions on unnecessary upgrades, or drowning people in bureaucracy, the pattern is the same\u2014losing sight of the actual mission.\nSmart leaders step back and ask, \u201cWhat are we really trying to achieve?\u201d Those who don\u2019t end up wasting resources, frustrating employees, and missing out on better solutions. If your strategy is just hitting numbers instead of delivering real value, you\u2019re not leading\u2014you\u2019re just checking boxes.\nWhat did you think of my take on these articles?

    "body": "Progress is always possible.\n \n\u00a0\n \nIssue 01\u00a0 |\u00a0 \u00a0\nView\u00a0in browser\n\u00a0 |\u00a0\u00a0\nSubscribe\n \nAt a time when there are so many challenges to social progress, Pivotal will be spotlighting those who are driving progress and the opportunities to accelerate change even further.\nA Note From Our President\nI\u2019ve been thinking about the fall of the Berlin Wall.\u00a0\nToday, most people look back on that historic event and see it as inevitable. But at the time, most experts out there said it was impossible: German reunification would never happen, the Cold War would never end, and the wall would never come down.\u00a0\nAnd those experts were right every single day. Until the day they weren\u2019t.\u00a0\u00a0\nSuddenly, the impossible became possible.\u00a0\u00a0\nOver the past 35 years, I\u2019ve often thought of the Berlin Wall when someone says that change will never come. And today, when so many of us who work on social progress see our work being challenged, it can feel like the barriers to equality and opportunity will never come down. But I firmly believe they will.\u00a0\nAs the president of Pivotal Ventures, I have the privilege of seeing firsthand \nhow our partners are chipping away at those barriers every day\n\u2014and hearing about their efforts always energizes me for the work ahead. In that spirit, we\u2019re introducing a new email series called The Digest, where we\u2019ll highlight those who are driving progress and the opportunities to accelerate change even further.\u00a0\u00a0\nThe future we seek may not happen overnight, but I know that the impossible can become possible. I\u2019ve seen it.\u00a0\n\u2013\n Brooke D. Anderson\nWomen's Political Power\nWave of women reps changes the face of power in states\n \nThe Center for American Women and Politics recently released its \u201cWomen in State Legislatures 2025\u201d report, and the trends point clearly in the direction of growing women\u2019s political power. When CAWP started counting in 1980, just over 10 percent of state reps were women. The proportion didn\u2019t cross the one-quarter mark until 2017. In 2025, it passed the one-third threshold. Next stop\u2026 50 percent!\n\u00a0 \nRead \nThe Report\n\u00a0\u00a0\nHealth of Women and Families\nOpen call reveals rich universe of ideas to improve women\u2019s health\n \nLast fall, in partnership with Lever for Change, Pivotal Philanthropies Foundation launched Action for Women\u2019s Health, a $250 million open call to fund organizations focused on women\u2019s mental and physical health. All told, the open call yielded proposals from organizations spanning 124 countries and six continents, and we couldn\u2019t be more excited by their ideas.\u00a0\u00a0\n\u00a0 \nLearn More\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\nWomen's Economic Power\nWomen investors seize new opportunities in venture capital\n \nWomen are still dramatically underrepresented in the VC industry, but female fund managers are proving every day why underrepresented perspectives are so desperately needed: They see opportunities that others tend to miss. Here\u2019s what five trailblazing investors and Pivotal Ventures partners had to say about the innovations that excite them in 2025, from an AI-powered revolution in productivity to digital healthcare with a human touch.\u00a0\n\u00a0 \nThe Trends Shaping 2025\n\u00a0 \u00a0\nFounder Update\nConnect with our founder, Melinda French Gates\n \nIn honor of International Women\u2019s Day and Women\u2019s History Month, Melinda sat down with LinkedIn to talk about career growth and women in leadership. Not only did she share some of her personal experiences navigating career transitions, but she also offered advice for others. \nCheck it out here.\n \n\u00a0\n \nMelinda\u2019s new book, The Next Day, comes out on April 15. She\u2019ll be traveling to six cities across the U.S. to share personal insights about the book, her experience writing it, and what she hopes readers will take away from it. Learn more about the \nbook tour \nhere\n.\n \n\u00a0\nPivotal is a group of organizations founded by Melinda French Gates in 2015. We work to accelerate the pace of social progress using high-impact investments, philanthropy, partnerships, and advocacy to get more power in the hands of more people\u2014especially women\u2014in the U.S. and around the world.

[[READ MORE]\n \n \nCLIENT ALERT \nFinCEN Limits Scope of Corporate Transparency Act to Foreign Reporting Companies\nClick to Download Corporate Transparency Act Disclosure Form\n \n \nTo: \u00a0Clients and Friends of Fox Swibel Levin & Carroll LLP\nOn March 21, 2025, the Financial Crimes Enforcement Network (FinCEN) published an interim final rule that exempts all entities created in the United States \u2014 including those previously known as \u201cdomestic reporting companies\u201d \u2014 and their beneficial owners from the requirement to report beneficial ownership information to FinCEN. This effectively eliminates reporting requirements for the vast majority of those previously qualified as \u201creporting companies.\u201d\n\u00a0\nReporting obligations still apply to foreign reporting companies \u2013 legal entities formed under the law of a foreign country that have registered to do business in any U.S. State by the filing of a document with a secretary of state or any similar office of a U.S. State. However, the rules provides that foreign reporting companies, and their U.S. person beneficial owners, are exempt from the requirement to provide the BOI of any U.S. persons who are beneficial owners of the foreign reporting company. Existing foreign companies that must report their beneficial ownership information now have an additional 30 days from the date of publication of the interim final rule to file.\n\u00a0\nFinCEN will accept comments on the interim final rule for 60 days and intends to issue a final rule this year. Fox Swibel will continue to monitor updates on CTA enforcement.

This executive order requires that all routine commercial goods and services be consolidated under the General Services Administration (GSA). Federal agencies now have 60 days to transition their acquisitions to the GSA or submit a comprehensive plan outlining their strategy for GSA-based procurement. As part of this significant overhaul, agencies will lose the ability to use previous contracts for these purchases.\nGSA Schedule System Set to Quadruple\nThis initiative is set to dramatically expand the GSA Schedule System. Josh Gruenbaum, head of GSA\u2019s Federal Acquisition Services, announced that the GSA aims to encompass approximately $400 billion in domestic commercial goods and services, effectively quadrupling its current size. \u201cOver the coming months, we are going to absorb all domestic commercial goods and services into the GSA,\u201d Gruenbaum stated. \u201cWhile we\u2019re not targeting the entire $900 billion market, we will bring on about $400 billion\u2014this will definitely quadruple our size.\u201d\nA Rush to Secure GSA Schedules, Particularly in IT\nThe executive order also indicates a substantial shift in IT procurement. The GSA is poised to take on a larger share of federal IT contracts, including existing Government-Wide Acquisition Contracts (GWACs). While the future use of existing contracts remains uncertain, it is anticipated that organizations with GSA Schedules will have a distinct advantage in securing upcoming opportunities. As the GSA's IT footprint expands, a surge of IT companies is likely to compete to secure a place on the GSA Schedule\u2014a process that typically takes 6 to 7 months.\nCentralization: The Future of IT Spending?\nThe outlook for federal IT spending suggests further centralization under the GSA. As procurement consolidates, firms eager to remain competitive for federal contracts will need to either obtain a GSA Schedule or devise a clear plan to do so. This shift will influence everything from contracting vehicles to the competitive landscape within federal IT.\nOur Perspective\nWith over 20 years of experience in federal contracting\u2014particularly with GSA Schedules\u2014we have never witnessed such a sweeping transformation with such far-reaching implications. This change represents a critical juncture for companies holding existing federal contracts, especially in IT and services. It is imperative for organizations to act swiftly to navigate the centralization of federal IT contracts and maintain their competitiveness in this evolving marketplace.\nEmily Hatchel\n859-360-0909\nwww.advancegsa.com\nAdvance GSA\n10500 Norbotten Dr\nFlorence Kentucky 41042\nUnited States \nYou are subscribed to this email as monica@lcwmail.com.\nClick here to modify your \npreferences\n or \nunsubscribe\n.",

    "body": "Musings and Meditations on Mindfulness\n \n \nMarch 2025\nWelcome to Issue No. 13 of MindTaming!\n\u200a\n \n \nOn My Mind:\n \nStaying Calm in the Turmoil\n \n\u201cWe don\u2019t have the luxury of despair.\u201d \u2013 U.S. Senator Jon Ossoff\nDear Friends,\nThis issue of \u201cMindTaming\u201d marks the beginning of year 4 of this blog focused on mindfulness practices, tools and resources. It seems that this type of practice is helpful to more and more people all around me. The mailing list for my Wednesday meditation group is growing every week. (For more information about this group and how to join, see the Community section below.)\nMeditation and mindfulness practices are one way to keep ourselves centered and grounded amid the chaos, uncertainty and constant change all around us, no matter where we stand politically. There are many other ways. We just can\u2019t give up \u2013 or in.\u00a0\nMaintaining a positive inner state, growing our resiliency, staying calm, getting rest and relying on our resources are all things we must do right now. Why? So that we can be our best selves, offer calm and peace to others and take action that aligns with our values and circumstances. As a white, well-educated, middle-class female, I can do a lot of things IF I take care of myself and my loved ones.\u00a0\u00a0\nWhen so many things around me seem out of my control, it\u2019s useful to focus on what I CAN control. My inner state and my physical well-being are things I do have control over. And they impact the way I show up in the world and the kind of behaviors I display.\u00a0\u00a0\nHere are a few things I have found helpful in these trying times:\nKeep things simple and don\u2019t aim for perfection\n. \nNot meeting every single deadline is ok \u2013 just let people know you\u2019re going to be late.\u00a0\n \nRealize that things take time\n. \nDon\u2019t expect immediate results and settle in for the long haul.\n \nDon\u2019t give up hope\n. \n\u201cHope is a discipline, a practice and a commitment,\u201d says American educator and activist Mariame Kaba. Follow her advice.\n \nPractice the 4 Cs\n. \nCommunity, Compassion, Curiosity and Courage.\u00a0\n \nHave fun and do joyful things\n. \n\u201cJoy is an act of resistance,\u201d declares poet Toy Derricotte in her poem \u201cThe Telly Cycle.\u201d\n \nFinally, be gentle with yourself. Try things out and experiment. Reverse course if something is not working. Most of all, remember what really matters to you \u2013 and trust your inner voice.\u00a0\nHow are you going to bring joy into your life in the coming months? I am exploring the heel of the Italian peninsula (Puglia) on a bicycle in April before participating in the final AIDS Vaccine charity bike ride near Atlanta in May. I hope both activities will help me stay centered and strong for the challenges ahead of us.\nWishing you a beautiful spring,\nRita\n \n \nTaming:\n \nCultivating Your Practice\n \nGet physical. Do something new with your hands.\nWhen I get nervous or worried or when I am looking for distraction, I find it helpful to do something with my hands. By using my body in this way and engaging a different part of my brain, I tend to feel more grounded and centered. There are many ways to \u201cget physical\u201d (in addition to exercising, cleaning, cooking, gardening, etc.).\u00a0\u00a0For instance:\nKnitting, crocheting, needlepoint or other kinds of crafts\n. I recently found a great \u201ccrocheting starter kit\u201d at an outfitters store. BTW, men knit, too. :-)\n \nWorking on art projects\n. We did a lot of that during the pandemic. Why not resurrect some of the activities from a few years ago? I mentioned taking up water-color painting in my last blog (finally scheduled for May \u2013 some things take a while to come to fruition).\n \nDoing\n\u00a0\njigsaw puzzles\n. \nThis is a still one of my favorite activities during colder weather. I currently have a very challenging 1000-piece jigsaw puzzle set up in my living room on a nifty new\u00a0\n\u201c\npuzzle board\n\u201d\n\u00a0that rotates.\n \nAnother \u201cphysical\u201d practice that many of us have lost touch with and that almost seems ancient and somewhat quaint now is\u00a0\nletter-writing\n. Yes, I mean a REAL letter, not a greeting card or a postcard (although those arrive at my house less and less frequently, too). I wrote about four or five letters this past year, and it was hard. My fingers were not used to holding a pen for so long, and my handwriting looked like that of a toddler towards the end of the letter. Still, I enjoyed this type of focused activity, and I felt good about the amount of physical and mental effort I had put into it once I was done. I also sometimes cut out newspaper articles and send them to friends \u2013 and they always comment on how touched they are to have received my letter. Why not surprise one of your loved ones with a special handwritten gift sometime?\n \n \nCommunity: Offerings for Practicing in Community\nAre you drawn to meditation? Have you tried it but gave up again?\u00a0\nJoin us online every Wednesday from 12-12:30pm EST for our free 30-min Midweek Mindfulness Meditation, and meditate with people from around the world.\u00a0\nDrop in as you can. Includes a check-in, a brief talk and 10-15 minutes of silent meditation. Free and open to anyone who is interested in practicing meditation in community. If you\u2019d like to receive a weekly reminder to participate, sign up\u00a0\nhere\n.\u00a0\n \nCool Resource\ns\nMinimal Reliance and Hope\n\"10% Happier with Dan Harris\u201d podcast\":\u00a0\n\"\n9 Ways to Break Free From the Habits That Are Holding You Back with Dr. Rangan Chatterjee\n\"\n\u00a0\n(2/3/2025). In this episode, Dan Harris talks with UK-based physician and author Dr. Rangan Chatterjee about things that can hold you back, including the tendency to only listen to what \u201cthe experts\u201d tell you instead of practicing \u201cminimal reliance\u201d and trusting your inner wisdom.\u00a0\nSubstack seems to be THE place where podcasters and bloggers post their offerings these days. I follow several writers, authors, teachers and activists whose posts I find interesting and inspiring. Here is a \npost by author and activist Patti Digh on HOPE\n\u00a0\n(3/25/2025)\n\u00a0\nand how to strengthen your \u201chope muscle.\u201d\n\u200a\nClick here to read \u00a0previous posts\n \n\u200a\n \nWant to bring mindfulness to your workplace?\nIf you or your organization are interested in bringing\u00a0mindfulness to your workplace and would\u00a0like to discuss what that might look like, please\u00a0\ncontact me\n\u00a0- and we'll set up an initial\u00a0(no-obligation) meeting.\n \n\u200a\nTell me what you think!\nI welcome any comment or question about anything mentioned in this blog.

Eligible purchases can be made by the Basic Card Member and any Additional Card Members on a single Card account. Eligible purchases are purchases for goods and services minus returns and other credits. Eligible purchases to meet the spend requirement do NOT include fees or interest charges, cash advances, purchases of traveler's checks, purchases or reloading of prepaid cards, purchases of gift cards, person-to-person payments, or purchases of any cash equivalents. Additional Card Members on your account are not eligible for their own offer. In rare instances, your period to spend $12,000 may be shorter than 6 months if there is a delay in receiving your Card. Also, purchases may fall outside of the 6 month period in some cases, such as a delay in merchants submitting transactions to us or if the purchase date differs from the date you made the transaction. (For example, if you buy goods online, the purchase date may be the date the goods are shipped). This offer is not transferable. If your application is not received by 04/02/2025, we will not process your application even if we later receive your application. American Express reserves the right to modify or revoke offer at any time. \u00a0\u200b\nIf you have a history of cancelling or downgrading American Express Card accounts within your first year and you cancel or downgrade your new Card account within your first year, we may not credit, we may freeze, or we may take away the bonus miles from your account. If we determine that you have engaged in abuse, misuse, or gaming in connection with this offer in any way or that you intend to do so, including if you return purchases you made to meet the Threshold Amount, we may not credit, we may freeze, or we may take away the bonus miles from your account. We may also cancel any accounts you have with us.\u200b\n2\n. \nTakeOff 15\n:\nEligibility\n:\u200b\nBasic Delta SkyMiles Gold, Platinum and Reserve American Express Card Members, as well as Basic Delta SkyMiles Gold, Platinum and Reserve Business American Express Card Members (each, an \u201cEligible Card\u201d), can get at least a fifteen percent (15%) discount off the mileage portion of an Award Ticket (the \u201cTakeOff 15\u201d benefit). Additional Card Members are not eligible. \u200b\nAvailable only if entire itinerary is on Delta and Delta Connection\n\u00ae\n carrier-operated and ticketed flights booked at \ndelta.com \nor the FlyDelta app. Not available on flights operated by other carriers. Not available for Pay with Miles, Miles + Cash, seat upgrades purchased after the initial flight booking, or other Delta products or services. Discount only applies to the mileage portion of the Award Ticket fare and does not apply to applicable taxes and fees which must be paid using the Eligible Card. Card Member must be logged-in to a SkyMiles account linked to an Eligible Card to receive the TakeOff 15 benefit discount. Mileage discount will be greater than or equal to 15% of the overall miles portion for the Award Ticket. An Award Ticket is a ticket issued by Delta pursuant to the SkyMiles Program Rules, by which SkyMiles members may redeem miles and pay applicable government-imposed taxes and fees in exchange for air transportation. All Award Ticket rules apply, as set forth on \ndelta.com\n and in the specific terms incorporated into your Award Ticket. Award Travel is defined as travel using an Award Ticket. Award Travel seats are limited and may not be available on all flights or in all markets.\u200b\nSkyMiles account balance must have sufficient miles for the entire Award Ticket(s) being purchased. TakeOff 15 benefit is not combinable with certificates, Delta eCredits, Delta Gift Cards, vouchers, or with any other discounts or promotional offers.\u00a0\nAward Ticket Taxes/Fees\n:\u200b\nAward Ticket taxes and fees include only U.S. excise and departure/arrival taxes, airport charges, segment fees, the September 11th Security Fee, and international taxes and fees normally included in the Award Ticket. \u200b\nAward Ticket Cancellations and Changes\n:\u200b\nIn the event of a voluntary cancellation of the Award Ticket to which the TakeOff 15 benefit was applied, redeemed miles will be redeposited into the Card Member\u2019s SkyMiles account, except for Basic Economy tickets. Current Award Ticket redeposit fees apply. Basic Economy cancellations will result in cancellation charge assessed in miles, as outlined in fare rules. Remaining miles after deduction of the cancellation charge will be redeposited to Card Member\u2019s SkyMiles account. There is no discount applicable to the cancellation charge. \u00a0\u200b\nIf changing an Award Ticket after ticketing, discount is applied to the new Award Ticket (if eligible), and the difference in miles will be deducted from the Card Member\u2019s SkyMiles account (if the new Award Ticket mileage amount is higher) or redeposited into the Card Member\u2019s SkyMiles account (if the new Award Ticket mileage amount is lower). Basic Economy tickets are not eligible for voluntary changes. SkyMiles Member must be an active Basic Delta SkyMiles, Gold, Platinum or Reserve American Express Card Member or Basic Delta SkyMiles Gold, Platinum or Reserve Business American Express Card Member at time that the Award Ticket is changed to be eligible for the TakeOff 15 benefit on the changed Award Ticket.\u200b\nMiscellaneous\n:\u200b\nAll SkyMiles Program rules apply to SkyMiles Program membership, miles, offers, mile accrual, mile redemption, and travel benefits.

    "body": "Plus, saunas are hot again. Here\u2019s what you need to know today.\n \n.\nTo view this email as a web page, click \nhere.\nWednesday - March 26, 2025\nToday's \nRundown\n is brought to you by WBEZ members and\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\nby Bianca Cseke\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\nGood afternoon! It\u2019s Wednesday, and so much for giving my wallet a break from concerts this year: \nLady Gaga\n just announced a new tour with two Chicago stops. Here\u2019s what you need to know today.\n\u00a0 \n1.\nTurnout for ballot questions hitting voters\u2019 wallets came down to race and wealth disparities\n\u00a0\nThough many people complain about new property taxes, only a few vote on whether to add them. Of that slim minority, voter turnout is highest in areas that are predominately white, wealthy and mostly homeowners. Turnout is lowest in poorer areas with more minorities and renters.\nThat\u2019s according to a new report from the Cook County Treasurer\u2019s office, which for the first time analyzed the demographic trends behind voter turnout disparities.\nCook County Treasurer Maria Pappas said the disparity in voting trends is worth considering in the upcoming April 1 consolidated elections in the Cook County suburbs, where more than $200 million in taxes and debts are on the ballot.\nLast year, 26 tax-related referendums out of 35 total passed in the March presidential primary and November general elections. The referendums included 14 municipal bonds creating $563 million in new debt and more than $4.5 million in new property tax levies in three districts.\nIn Chicago, the Bring Chicago Home referendum failed by a four-point margin in the presidential primary. Mayor Brandon Johnson\u2019s so-called \u201cmansion tax\u201d on property transfers worth more than $1 million would have addressed homelessness. Only 23.5% of Chicago voters weighed in on the measure, according to the analysis. [\nChicago Sun-Times\n]\n2.\nA Chicago Archdiocese lawsuit alleges a conspiracy to file false sex abuse claims against a defrocked priest\n\u00a0\nThe lawsuit is a counterclaim against several cases involving convicted child molester and former priest Daniel McCormack, which were filed in late December and are still pending, according to court records.\nThe defendants are listed as John Does to comply with various court orders. Many live on the West Side, and some are related to one another. The web of connected individuals includes more than two dozen people, according to the archdiocese.\nBeginning about 2012, the two ringleaders of the alleged racket directed conspirators to claim they came into contact with McCormack at church or through a basketball team McCormack coached, my Chicago Sun-Times colleague Emmanuel Camarillo reports.\nIn exchange for \u201cscripts,\u201d the men received a cut of the settlements. They did this because they blew through the money they received from their own settlements over alleged sexual abuse claims against McCormack, the suit says.\n\u201cWe trust and believe people when they come forward with abuse claims. These individuals have violated that trust and have attempted to take advantage of it,\u201d James Geoly, general counsel for the archdiocese, said in a statement. \u201cWe have a duty to oppose claims we know are false to protect and stand up for real survivors of abuse who ultimately are the ones harmed by fraud.\u201d [\nChicago Sun-Times\n]\nSPONSOR MESSAGE FROM ACCESS CONTEMPORARY MUSIC\nThe 20th Annual Sound of Silent Film Festival\nAccess Contemporary Music\u2019s popular Sound of Silent Film Festival is a unique event featuring new short silent films in every conceivable genre screened with newly-composed musical scores performed live. This year is the 20th anniversary of the festival! \nJoin us\n at the gorgeous Music Box Theater for this special event on April 2nd at 7:30 PM.\n3.\nA Trump executive order targets a Chicago law firm\n\u00a0\nPresident Donald Trump signed an executive order yesterday targeting a major Chicago-based law firm that previously employed Andrew Weissmann, who worked on special counsel Robert Mueller\u2019s team examining suspected Russian interference in Trump\u2019s 2016 election campaign.\nAs my colleague Kade Heather reports for the Chicago Sun-Times, the order aims to investigate Jenner & Block\u2019s security clearances, government contracts and access to federal buildings. Trump alleges Jenner & Block \u201cengages in obvious partisan representations to achieve political ends.\u201d\nLast week, a federal judge blocked parts of a similar executive order against a prominent firm in Seattle. [\nChicago Sun-Times\n]\n4.\nTony\u2019s Fresh Market workers have kicked off union voting\n\u00a0\nMore than 2,000 workers across Tony\u2019s 21 stores in Chicago and the suburbs have until tomorrow to decide if they want to join Local 881 United Food and Commercial Workers, my colleague Amy Yee reports for the Chicago Sun-Times.\nThe proposed bargaining unit could include about 2,400 Tony\u2019s employees. Full- and part-time clerks, assistant managers and department managers are eligible.\nEmployees are demanding better pay, health insurance and workplace conditions. Results are expected Friday. [\nChicago Sun-Times\n]\n5.\nHappy hour is out. In Chicago, sauna socializing is in.\n\u00a0\nNate Daubert has a unique role in Chicago spa culture: He\u2019s the city\u2019s only certified \u201csaunamaster,\u201d WBEZ contributor Ximena N. Beltran Quan Kiu reports.\n\u201cPeople are looking for ways to reconnect to nature, especially since the pandemic really digitized our entire lives,\u201d Daubert said. \u201cThere\u2019s an increasing need for people to remove themselves from technology, and sauna is a really great way to do that, on top of the science and health benefits.\u201d\u00a0\nResearch by the Mayo Clinic shows that the use of sauna offers health benefits like reducing the risk of vascular disease (such as high blood pressure); alleviating headaches, arthritis and the flu; and increasing skin health. [\nWBEZ\n]\nIncluding Eastend, the sauna where Daubert works, here are 10 spots to try out to get through Chicago\u2019s remaining chilly weather. [\nWBEZ\n]\n\u00a0\nHere's what else is happening\n\u00a0\nNPR and PBS leaders answered lawmakers\u2019 allegations of bias during a House subcommittee hearing today. [\nNPR\n]\nThe Atlantic released the entire Signal chat showing national security officials\u2019 detailed attack plans against Houthis. [\nAP\n]\nHundreds of people in Gaza took part in the largest anti-Hamas protest since the war with Israel began. [\nNPR\n]\nHere are the numbers to know for each of the 16 teams remaining in March Madness. [\nAP\n]\n\u00a0\nOh, and one more thing...\n\u00a0\nPreservationists see the correction of building code violations at the Walser House as a critical first step toward a Frank Lloyd Wright home being rescued and reused, my colleague Lee Bey reports.\nBuilt in 1903 for printing executive Joseph Jacob Walser Jr., the stucco home came relatively early in Wright\u2019s career. Its strong horizontal lines, overhanging eaves and bands of windows would later become trademarks of his larger and more celebrated Prairie School work.\nEven with that history, the home has been in disrepair for decades. The nightmarish list of needed repairs includes rotting wood, cracked and failing exterior stucco, exposed structural elements, a deteriorating roof and chimney \u2014 and much more.\nThe neighborhood group Austin Coming Together and a coalition of architecture organizations hope the home can go to a nonprofit that can raise the millions needed to restore the house and convert it to public use. [\nChicago Sun-Times\n]\n\u00a0\nTell me something good\n\u00a0\nI was just in India and saw the Taj Mahal, and it absolutely lived up to the hype as one of the most beautiful buildings in the world. That has me wondering, what\u2019s something that left you in awe while traveling, whether it\u2019s an iconic landmark or a unique experience?\nSamantha writes:\n\u201cI know this sounds nuts. I have traveled the world, lived on three continents, and the one place that takes my breath away is Atwater Park just north of Milwaukee. Looking out from the top on a clear, sunny day you can see the sunken piers disappear into a Lake Michigan filled with blues and greens of all shades. Highly recommend stopping by for a quick moment of zen if you're ever passing through.\u201d\nMarty writes:\n\u201cMy favorite site was Muir Woods in California. The majesty and beauty of that location inspires great reverence for the wonders of the natural world. I felt as if I were in a medieval cathedral with the awesome silence and spiritual connection one feels when walking through those woods. Seeing the natural growth and animals interact was truly inspiring. Made me feel both insignificant and empowering that I and others could experience this wondrous sight!\u201d\nAnd Sharon writes:\n\u201cDriving across the Gobi Desert, you can see 360 degree views. No roads, only vehicle tracks in the sand. Utterly quiet, no airplanes overhead. We spent nights with nomads in their gers (tents). As we drove away in the morning, they tossed goats\u2019 milk after the van for good luck.\u201d\nFeel free to email me, and your response may be included in the newsletter this week.\nThanks for reading and have a nice night! I'll see you tomorrow.\n\u2014 Bianca Cseke\nThe Rundown is reader-funded.\u00a0\nYour gift of any amount helps power this newsletter and all of WBEZ\u2019s reporting.\u00a0\nDONATE TODAY\n\u00a9Chicago Public Media Inc 848 East Grand Ave, Navy Pier Chicago, IL 60611\nUnsubscribe\u00a0from The Daily Rundown\n\u00a0| \nPrivacy Policy",

From Angelyne, the original influencer, to Hedy Lamarr, the mother of Wi-Fi, these women revolutionized industries and left lasting legacies.\nIn this blog, we celebrate the lives of trailblazing women like Muriel Fox, Joan Ganz Cooney, and the ENIAC programmers\u2014whose contributions to advertising, technology, activism, and education are often overlooked.\nRead on to learn more about these incredible women who paved the way for so many of today\u2019s innovations and movements.\nEqual Pay Day: A Call for Change and Equity\n Equal Pay Day is more than just a statistic\u2014it\u2019s a call for action. For women of color, the gap between what we earn and what our white male counterparts earn is a stark reminder of the systemic inequality still present in the workforce. In honor of Equal Pay Day, I reflect on the powerful work of women like Minda Harts and Shonda Rhimes, who have paved the way for women of color to assert their value and fight for the pay we deserve.\nThis blog is a reminder that the fight for equal pay isn\u2019t over, but with continued effort and voices like Minda\u2019s and Shonda\u2019s leading the charge, we will push for the change that\u2019s long overdue.

It also ignited a stream of constant attacks on our shared values of equity, inclusion and fairness for all.\u00a0 November\u2019s election was the clearest signal yet that a new strategic direction is warranted. Our country is evolving, the DEI industry is evolving and Mossier is evolving too.\nFor starters, \nwe\u2019ve made the difficult decision to sunset our job seeker and recruiting programs including our job board, resume database and hiring events\n. This decision was extremely difficult mostly because we don\u2019t want to leave our Mossier job seeker community hanging. \n\u00a0\nWe know how hard it is to navigate the job search as an LGBTQ person.\n\u00a0 \nUltimately\n, \nthis decision was made for a variety of reasons:\nThe needs of our clients are evolving.\u00a0 Between a slow down in hiring and a bullish Trump administration threatening to dismantle DEI, what we\u2019re hearing from clients is they need more support navigating an ever-shifting legal environment, assessing reputational risk and improving the impact of their internal DEI programs.\nIt\u2019s not what we are best at\n. There are other players in the LGBTQ recruiting and career coaching space (click here to see our faves) who have made supporting LGBTQ job seekers their core work and we highly encourage you to check them out.\nWe want to dedicate all of our effort to helping workplaces get set-up so\n they can actually retain LGBTQ employees \nonce they are hired. We\u2019ve seen first hand, and research is indicating, that biased promotion processes, inconsistent hiring operations and feedback mechanisms and a lack of leadership buy-in is slowing down progress for LGBTQ employees.\nOur mission will be the same moving forward. In short, Mossier will continue to enable employment equity for everyone LGBTQ through culture assessments, strategy development and training and coaching. We\u2019ll be sharing more about our updated services soon so stay tuned.\nWe encourage all of our Mossier job seekers to check out these job seeker resources.\u00a0 If you need support in finding your next employer, don\u2019t hesitate to reach out to \ninfo@mossier.com\n and we will help connect you to the right people.\nChallenges lie ahead for our shared vision of a more inclusive and healthy world where everyone can thrive at work but we are so grateful to be in that fight with you.\nWith love and gratitude,\nNick\nJob Seeker Resources\nOrganizations supporting LGBTQ job seekers:\nTwin Cities Pride\nOut for Undergrad\nReaching Out MBA\nOut in Tech\nBlack Remote She\nOut Professionals\nTrans Can Work\nCareer Coaches Supporting LGBTQ Job Seekers:\nAlex Lahmeyer\n: \nAlex is a queer and non-binary coach who helps LGBTQ+ professionals navigate key career moments.

And the Of Note section is getting longer. So, without further ado, feel free to dive in\u2026\n\ufeff\n1. \nReclaiming Knowledge: The Evolution of Decolonial Thought and the DIA Framework\n by Christian Ortiz\nChristian Ortiz has been bringing it recently - I look forward to seeing his articles in my LinkedIn feed. What I like about this article isn't just the theme and approach but also the fact that he explicitly acknowledges that it's built on ancestral wisdom and that it's being released to the world as a shared piece of knowledge: \n\u201cThis framework is not meant to be static. It does not seek validation from colonial institutions but remains in dialogue with the communities it serves. It is a communal offering, designed to grow through continuous engagement with Black, Indigenous, and feminist knowledge keepers.\u201d\n2. \nWhen Education Erases: The Harm in Superficial Black History Lessons\n by Meghan Stewart\nI felt the opening sentence to my core. Though there was some Caribbean flavour, my own education was largely very \"English grammar school\" in approach. As this author points out, we can and must do better: \n\u201cI need our history to be honoured with the same depth and care as other histories. I need our stories to exist beyond civil rights struggles and adversity. I want my daughter to know that she comes from a lineage of artists, healers, visionaries, mathematicians, and philosophers. That she is more than resistance, she is also creativity, joy, and possibility.\u201d\n3. \nMaroon Leadership: A Blueprint for Workplace Resistance and Collective Strength\n by Janice Gassam Asare, Ph.D.\nOne thing I DID learn about in school was the resistance to enslavement by the Maroons of Jamaica, which is why this article caught my eye. It points the way to a model of resistance and community that's much needed in these times: \n\u201cThese communities thrived by leveraging collectivism, strategic adaptability, and ancestral wisdom. This leadership framework draws from the spirit of Sankofa, going back and reclaiming what is valuable from our past. It recognizes that beyond the trauma and oppression imposed on the African diaspora, there is also a rich inheritance of resistance, innovation, and self-determination.\u201d\n4. title\n4. \nWhat is White Nationalism?\n by Arturo Dominguez\nAs the author points out, we need to understand it to fight it, so here's a primer: \n\u201cOnce referred to as \u201cleaderless\u201d movements \u2013 a decades-old misnomer \u2013 these hate groups and far-right extremists can no longer be referred to as such. While they have always had obvious leaders, legacy media often refers to those who commit hate crimes as \u201clone wolves\u201d or refer to the broad amount of hate groups as leaderless. This is largely attributable to the fragmented nature of hate groups nationally. We can all see who their leaders are now.\u201d\n5. \nHow White Co-Workers Can Derail Black Women's Careers\n by Monique Judge\nTall poppies, glass cliffs - whatever the syndrome Black women are often disproportionately affected, and it's their white co-workers who bear much of the responsibility: \n\u201cBlack women who begin their careers working around a higher percentage of white co-workers are more likely to leave their jobs and less likely to get promoted. This means that even when Black women are hired \u2014 and best believe, they have to go above and beyond to prove that they are \u201cworthy\u201d of being hired \u2014 they are not set up for success in the workplace in the same way that their white counterparts are.\u201d\n6. \n10 Books That Shaped Black History Over the Last Century\n by Kai Mora\nI had a moment of joy as I typed this, because it's a compilation by an African writer on a Nigerian publication featuring Black literature. I always aim to include resources from around the globe and I'm delighted to include this here: \n\u201cbelow is an attempt to map some of the most influential literary interventions made in Black history during the twentieth century. The books on this list not only shaped Black history over the last century, but also reflect the diversity yet unity with which Africans on the continent and in the diaspora saw themselves, their history, and thus, their purpose.\u201d\n7. \nA Path to Wellness for Black Women\n by David McQueen\nThe disparities experienced by Black women in healthcare systems are well know. Here, David McQueen draws some threads together to move towards leadership that can address these issues: \n\u201cBlack women working collectively to advocate for better healthcare policies and services is a must whether that is forming local wellness groups to encourage accountability and shared learning, or leveraging social media and online platforms to amplify issues and mobilise communities to demand change.\u201d\nFact-based news without bias awaits.

Is Anybody Doing Anything?\n by Sherrilyn Ifill\nThings are moving so quickly that this article might feel a bit dated, but two points remain relevant. First, where the responsibility lies for the current mess in the US (and indeed, in the world). Second, that there is and continues to be resistance: \n\u201cBut this moment we find ourselves in is the result of the reckless voting of our fellow Americans in 2024, the failures of our media over decades, the critical political mistakes of our leaders, the short-sighted greed of the corporate community, and the longstanding lack of urgency about repairing the gaping cracks in our democratic infrastructure over far too many years. There is no magical way out.We are reaping what has been sown by many, many years of inattention to the eroding foundations of our democracy and we must face it.\u201d\n9. \nThrowback Thursday: Dealing With Racist Bone Disease\n by Michael Harriott\nAnd now, a little bit of satire with a foundation in reality: \n\u201cPerhaps the most disturbing part about the illness is that the bone-ified racists can never admit that they are infected. When asked, Osteowypiposis sufferers will offer bold assurances that they have not contracted the virus. However, all of the available research indicates that there has never been a case of a racist who was aware of their racism until it metastasized into its incurable, late-stage form known as the \u201cTrumpian stage.\u201d\n10. \nHow Black music record stores changed UK music forever\n by 2Funky Arts\nTo round out our main selection this month, a positive story about the influence of Black culture in the UK: \n\u201c\nIt\u2019s also clear how much camaraderie these record stores offered. These places were about more than buying records \u2013 they afforded the chance for people to learn about gigs, watch performances, hear about parties and get a music education.\n\u201d\n\ufeffOf Note - Things Worth Highlighting\nLearning for Good\n - a monthly newsletter which share useful resources \nDigital Green Book\n - trusted voices and credible resources for the Black community \nThe Future of DEI\n virtual summit - convened by Erin Corine Johnson of the Reparations Race and Hola Magnolia \nDEI Support Hub\n for federal workers in the US \nThe Racism Survival Spectrum\n by Dr Shungu H.

It\u2019s a couple of years since this article on proximity was first published and it still rings true. I\u2019ve updated it with some new links and a couple of relevant Instagram galleries, but otherwise, it\u2019s pretty much as originally written. Check it out\u2026\nProximity Isn\u2019t The Flex You Think It Is\nI know some white people may be offended by this but it needs to be said: proximity to a Black or Global Majority person doesn\u2019t make you an expert on their experience. For sure, you have a ringside seat to many of the oppressions they face. And because you care about them, you can empathise with their pain but, and it\u2019s an important but, you don\u2019t have the same experience - viscerally - that they do. It\u2019s another of those cases where you need to know what you don\u2019t know. \nIn the past, I\u2019ve talked about the \n\u201cBlack friend defence\u201d\n - the use of a Black person you happen to know as a way to undermine the validity of what the Black person in front of you is saying. There\u2019s also the \u201c\nBlack partner defence\n\u201d which is (you guessed it) the use of a Black person you\u2019re married to or partnered with to undermine the validity of what the Black person in front of you is saying. \nIt\u2019s time for that to stop. Seriously, it\u2019s another manifestation of \nwhite supremacy\n. And I have to wonder if your Black friend or partner appreciates being used this way. \nour.moral.imperative\n\u00a0\nour.moral.imperative\n\u00a0 \nAdd a comment...\nThank you for being on the free list for Sharon\u2019s Anti-Racism Newsletter.

You can find pricing options here: \nShow me how I can support SARN \nNow, if you\u2019re doing it with context, that\u2019s one thing. I publish a whole newsletter and I have said stuff in here you can quote, but when you do that, remember that I am \nnot a monolith\n. I have had certain experiences around the globe that inform what I write and speak about, and how I do that. Many of those experiences give me things in common with Black people around the world; but some are unique to my own cultural background. If you have learned things on your journey that you believe reflect a collective view, you certainly can share those, but be mindful of the fact that you might not know it all. After all, who does? \nInstead of going straight for the Black friend defence, question \nyour own motivations\n for using it. Are you doing it because your actual Black friend said something relevant to what you\u2019re talking about? Or because you have a number of Black friends who share this opinion and it\u2019s therefore a kind of collective expression? That might be ok. \nOr are you doing it because you\u2019re looking for backup for something you\u2019re not sure of yourself, and want to escape being challenged? If it\u2019s the latter, then that\u2019s a problem. \nevolvedteacher\n\u00a0\nevolvedteacher\n\u00a0 \nAdd a comment...\nTo wrap this up, there\u2019s a world of difference between telling someone \u201cI have a Black friend and all Black people feel this way\u201d and saying \u201cMy friend x, who is Black, feels this way\u201d. Context and nuance matter in this, as in everything. So, remember to pause the next time you\u2019re thinking of using your \nproximity to Blackness\n or to a Global Majority person to take down someone else\u2019s argument. Pause and figure out it if this is really the best approach for all concerned. Nine times out of 10 it isn\u2019t. \n[2025 update: my challenge to you all is to notice when the temptation to use proximity as a a defence creeps in and then choose to do something different.]\nThanks for reading,\nSharon\nNote: poll feedback is private - if you\u2019re happy to share your thoughts in public, then please also \nleave a comment\n.\nWhat did you think of today's article?\n\ud83d\udd25\ud83d\udd25\ud83d\udd25I loved it!\n \u00a0|\u00a0 \n\ud83d\udd25\ud83d\udd25I liked it\n \u00a0|\u00a0 \n\ud83d\udd25It was ok\nLeave a comment \nFact-based news without bias awaits.

Here\u2019s what you need to know today.\n \n.\nTo view this email as a web page, click \nhere.\nTuesday - March 25, 2025\nToday's \nRundown\n is brought to you by WBEZ members and\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\nby Bianca Cseke\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\nGood afternoon! Here\u2019s where you can celebrate \nEid al-Fitr\n in the Chicago area next week. And here\u2019s what else you need to know today.\n\u00a0 \n1.\nMayor Brandon Johnson lacks the votes to compel CPS to make a city pension payment, giving him days to find the cash\n\u00a0\nSeven of 20 Board of Education members say they oppose reimbursing the city for a disputed pension payment, dooming the budget\u2019s chances of passing, my colleagues Nader Issa, Sarah Karp and Fran Spielman report.\u00a0\n\u201cWe cannot in good conscience make payments towards things for which we have no sustainable means of raising revenue,\u201d the board members wrote in a letter first reported by Chalkbeat Chicago.\nA postponed vote would have amended the CPS budget to include three additional costs: the pension payment, which also covers CPS staff who aren\u2019t teachers; a CTU contract that\u2019s nearing settlement; and a not-yet-settled agreement with the new principals union.\nThe mayor has pushed for CPS to pay all three expenses using what\u2019s left of a record nearly $300 million tax-increment financing surplus, provided by his office, and other methods, such as short-term borrowing or debt restructuring. Johnson\u2019s office said yesterday it would keep working with the board to find a solution and \u201ccontinues to expect CPS\u201d to make the pension payment. The mayor has not presented a Plan B.\nIf the city doesn\u2019t get the money from CPS by March 31, Johnson will have three bad choices: close the books on 2024 in the red, find the $175 million elsewhere in the city budget or dip into reserves. [\nChicago Sun-Times/WBEZ\n]\n2.\nIllinois returned nearly 1,500 acres of stolen land to the state\u2019s first federally recognized tribe\n\u00a0\nGov. JB Pritzker has signed a law to restore Shabbona State Park, about 1,500 acres in DeKalb County, to the Prairie Band Potawatomi Nation, my Sun-Times colleague Violet Miller reports.\nThe law\u2019s passage attempts to correct what state lawmakers called a \u201chistoric injustice\u201d from 175 years ago, when the U.S. government auctioned off nearly 1,300 acres of Prairie Band land while Chief Shab-eh-nay was visiting relatives in Kansas. Illinois established the state park after it purchased the land with federal grant funds between 1969 and 1978.\nPrairie Band Chairman Joseph Rupnick, the fourth great-grandson of Chief Shab-eh-nay, said the move showed that \u201chealing and reconciliation are possible.\u201d [\nChicago Sun-Times\n]\nSPONSOR MESSAGE FROM MUSIC OF THE BAROQUE\nMozart & His Mentors April 7\nMozart has inspired many music lovers. But who inspired him? Join \nMusic of the Baroque\n April 7 at the Harris Theater as Jane Glover leads \n\u201cMozart and His Mentors,\u201d\n featuring his \nParis\n Symphony alongside works by Hasse and Myslive\u010dek.

Panelists include neighborhood business development centers such as Allies for Community Business, Women\u2019s Business Development Center and Score.\u00a0\nAttendees can register at \nChicago.gov/BizExpo\n.

[\nChicago Sun-Times\n]\n5.\n\u2018The Listeners\u2019 casts a soprano from Chicago to lead its convention-shattering story\n\u00a0\nA charismatic cult leader, lurid affairs, weed and ample cursing: It may sound like the type of bingeable plot you\u2019d find on Netflix or a podcast feed. But these are the makings of a buzzy new opera, \nThe Listeners\n, which will have its Chicago premiere this week, my colleague Courtney Kueppers reports.\nAt the center of it all is the leading lady, a complex 40-something teacher, wife and mother named Claire. In opera, that character too is a novelty.\n\u201cEvery opera is based on some young ing\u00e9nue or a male role who is heroic in some type of way,\u201d said Nicole Heaston, the soprano from Chicago who plays Claire. \u201cThere are no roles written for middle-aged women.\u201d\nUntil now, that is. In a lot of ways, \nThe Listeners\n is a course correction for opera, a 400-year-old art form that tends to lean on the hits, mostly created centuries ago by white, male composers.

    "body": "Plus: Are AI Agents Tools Or Workers? | A Potential U.S. Science Brain Drain | Work Group Chats Gone Wrong \nBECOME A MEMBER\n\u00a0\u2022\u00a0\nNewsletters\n\u00a0\u2022\u00a0\nMyForbes\nPresident Donald Trump\u2019s latest target? Big law firms. But their associates and other legal professionals are trying to fight back.\u00a0\nSince he took office in January, Trump has signed a number of executive orders restricting access and government business with some of the biggest and most prestigious law firms in the country. The common thread: They all worked for clients that President Trump \u201cdisfavors,\u201d including Hillary Clinton, George Soros and former special counsel Jack Smith.\u00a0\nSuch actions have stirred up concern, contempt and even panic amongst legal professionals. But it was President Trump\u2019s second \nexecutive order\n\u2014one that removes the security clearance of Perkins Coie attorneys and requires federal contractors to disclose any business they retain with the law firm\u2014that was the final straw for many in the field.\nTake Rachel Cohen, a third-year finance associate at the Chicago offices of Skadden, Arps, Slate, Meagher & Flom who, in a \nnow-viral email and LinkedIn post\n, put in her two-weeks notice and called out her employer for not standing up to the president. She\u2019s one of over 1,500 signatories to a \nletter\n calling on big law leadership to join the American Bar Association in condemning Trump\u2019s actions.\u00a0\u00a0\nPerkins Coie is one of the law firms taking action, and after hiring Williams & Connolly\u2014known for aggressively fighting the federal government\u2014to represent them in court, won a \npreliminary injunction\n on the executive order.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\nBut others aren\u2019t. Shortly after Trump signed an executive order similarly restricting Paul Weiss, the global law firm announced it would stop all DEI programs and commit $40 million worth of pro-bono work to the Trump Administration. The executive order was then removed. Once again, legal professionals were not happy.\u00a0\nBut Trump has only increased his fight against some of the biggest law firms in the country since then. The Equal Employment Opportunity Commission sent a letter to 20 \u201cbig law\u201d firms last week \nover their DEI policies.\n On Friday, the president \ninstructed\n Attorney General Pam Bondi to \u201cseek sanctions against attorneys and law firms who engage in frivolous, unreasonable, and vexatious litigation against the United States\u201d or U.S. executive agencies.\u00a0\nWhere the profession goes from here is unclear, with associates ready but afraid to publicly speak up and firms facing seemingly \u201c\nexistential threats\u201d\n from these executive orders. And all of this is occurring in a year where law school applications are \nup 20%\n.\u00a0\nMaria Gracia Santillana Linares\u00a0\nCareers Reporter\nFollow me on\u00a0\nForbes.com\nWORK SMARTER\nPractical insights and advice from \nForbes \nstaff and contributors to help you succeed in your job, accelerate your career and lead smarter\nShut down \noffice drama \nwith four simple words: \n\u201cJust the facts, please.\u201d\nCould \nburning bridges\n actually be the\n\u00a0\nright career move?\nTips and tricks on \nusing ChatGPT\n \nto improve your workflow.\u00a0\nQ&A With Lattice CEO Sarah Franklin\n\"I\u2019m not saying I\u2019m more intelligent, but I\u2019m much wiser,\" Mackey tells Forbes as he re-enters \"start-up mode.\"\n\u00a0 \nLattice\nAre AI Agents Tools Or Digital Workers?\nRead Article\nLast July, Lattice CEO Sarah Franklin received a flurry of online criticism after announcing on LinkedIn that the people management company would start creating performance review packages for \u201cdigital workers.\u201d But as more companies releases AI agents, was she ahead of the curve? I spoke with Franklin about Lattice\u2019s own AI products and how the conversation around AI workers has changed in the last eight months. Our conversation has been edited for length and clarity, and you can find a full version of it here.\u00a0\nWhat has been the biggest shift in the HR and people space with the rise of AI?\nWe\u2019re moving into this AI economy where it\u2019s no longer just about data, it\u2019s really about intelligence. It\u2019s not about how we automate, it\u2019s around autonomy. And in that frame, the most important thing is the question around trust.\u00a0\nHow do you build trust with a machine then?\nIt\u2019s the same way we always have\u2013\u2013with time, doing things well and showing up. I think a good analogy is the evolution of ATMs and tellers, especially with HR files. You think about money\u2013\u2013that\u2019s something you really wanna trust somebody with. The idea of going into a bank and depositing your money was something that required a different level of trust than for you to go to a metal box and have it handle your money. That took time to develop. It\u2019s the same with AI.\u00a0\nBut what\u2019s different is that AI adoption is happening fast, so we can\u2019t afford mistakes. We can\u2019t afford to lose trust at all. So we have to be transparent, we have to be accountable, and we have to continuously ask ourselves hard questions. Not just how can it be helpful, but how can it be hurtful, to avoid losing that trust. And that\u2019s the same thing with AI is that we have to hold it to transparent accountability, especially the people that are implementing and deploying the AI in our business.\u00a0\nIt sounds like what you tried to do with the \ndigital worker records last summer\n. Why do you think it was so contentious at the time?\nWe\u2019re really in a whole new era with a digital workforce. What\u2019s very interesting is that we usually think of these shifts needing huge new technology to be developed that is going to be very complicated to roll out. The difference is this technology, AI, is not complicated to roll out and it\u2019s quite simple to interact with. The big lift is making the mental shift and thinking, \u201coh, my colleague may be a person or it also may be an AI digital worker.\u201d That is mind blowing!\u00a0\nLast July, when we saw this coming, people weren\u2019t ready for it then. And not to say they\u2019re even ready for it now, but they\u2019re understanding what is happening. There\u2019s still a big lack of education for what a digital worker would be like, even with AI agents.\nHow are you defining AI agents?\nAI agents can answer questions. Right now at Lattice, we\u2019re really oriented towards being helpful and answering questions. And the next step is when it becomes autonomous. This is where the trust thing is really important. When agents start acting and talking and making decisions on your behalf, and you don\u2019t know with certainty what the outcome is going to be, that requires a whole different level of trust. It requires a whole different level of accountability and transparency.\nWhat does that trust and accountability look like in practice?\nWell on a practical level, holding the tools accountable means very simply writing down what their job is and what they\u2019re supposed to be doing. This is something that we haven\u2019t had for decades\u2013\u2013accountable software for what they\u2019re supposed to be doing. They\u2019re supposed to be saving us time and money, but it hasn\u2019t really fulfilled that promise in the sense of making our lives easier. So the first thing we need to do is write it down. What do we expect the AI to do? Second thing we need to do is write down and know who is going to be in charge of managing the AI. Third, we need to regularly evaluate the performance of the AI, just as we do any piece of our business or work. So it\u2019s not a complicated new thing, it\u2019s what we do now, but we have to just start. Because we can\u2019t lose control of the AI. We need to know who\u2019s managing it so it\u2019s working for us\n.\u00a0\nSounds a lot like job descriptions and performance reviews! So ultimately, are AI agents tools or digital workers?\nAI is a technology, it is not human. AI is not a person. It is getting very good at imitating and understanding, and being able to reason similarly to how a human can. I think of police officers that go to work with their dog\u2013\u2013the K-9 units. They work together with an animal because the animal can sniff out certain things humans cannot.\u00a0\nThe future in my mind is that we will all be different and have different functions, but we need to learn how to collaborate together. We need to understand each other\u2019s jobs, functions and hold each other accountable to our performance and be transparent about how we\u2019re doing. So AI is not a human, but AI is an entity that we will work with, just like the police officers with their dogs.\u00a0 \nTOUCH BASE\n \nHegseth Says \u2018Nobody Was Texting War Plans\u2019 After Atlantic Editor Claims He Was Part Of Signal Chat\n \n(Photo by Win McNamee/Getty Images)\n \nNews from the world of work\nWork group chats gone wrong: \nThe top national security officials of the United States were caught red-handed this week when the editor-in-chief of \nThe Atlantic\n \nrevealed he\u2019d been mistakenly added\n to an encrypted Signal chat (whose messages were set to disappear after a week) discussing plans to bomb Houthi rebels in Yemen. \nDefense secretary Pete Hegseth has denied\n the existence of such messages, despite the \nNational Security Council saying\n the messages appeared to be an authentic communication chain and was reviewing the matter.\u00a0\nDOGE cuts are not only impacting federal workers. \nConsulting firm Accenture warned investors last week \nthat the \ncuts may affect the company\u2019s sales and revenue\n.\n \nRevenue from the federal government accounted for 16% of the company\u2019s Americas revenue in the most recent fiscal year.\u00a0\nTalk about an over-extended work trip.

The Alphabet Workers Union (AWU) set a tech industry precedent by negotiating remote roles and workplace protections for Google Help contractors. In the public sector, the American Federation of Government Employees (AFGE) secured telework rights for Social Security Administration staff until 2029, boosting productivity amid staffing shortages. Globally, unions are addressing surveillance, work-life balance, and career equity in remote work agreements. \nThese efforts signal a shift toward modernized labor activism, ensuring flexibility and protections for employees while strengthening unions' relevance in a digital workforce.\nTo learn more, check out this \nblog\n.\nRead Blog\n \nPrefer video to text?

You can read more testimonials \nhere\n.\n \n\u201cWe had the pleasure of co-hosting a webinar that was presented by Dr. Gleb. This webinar, using hybrid work to improve retention and productivity while cutting costs, was an excellent experience. He presented his research in a thoughtful and engaging way. He engaged with his attendees. He also gave them the opportunity to ask questions and give feedback at the end of the webinar. As a result, \nthe survey feedback that we received following Dr. Gleb's presentation was resoundingly positive\n. If you have the opportunity to work with Dr. Gleb, whether as a presenter or consultant in your organization, I highly recommend it.\u201d\nBrandie Laughner\n, \nPresident of the Virtual Chapter of the Labor and Employment Relations Association\nSchedule a Free Consultation\n \nWhat's Up With Me\nI was recently asked to be an expert witness in the killing of Amaree\u2019ya Henderson, a Black American, by police during a routine traffic stop in Kansas City, Kansas. The police acted aggressively and escalated the situation, Henderson tried to drive away, and was then shot and killed. I was asked to explain the anxiety of Black Americans in response to discrimination and aggression by police, as well as the emotional distress experienced by his girlfriend, who was in the car with him, and his mother, who was on Facetime on the phone during the stop.\u00a0\nI read the report on the incident, and then watched the\n \nbody cam footage\n \nof the police officer doing the shooting, and my response to the body cam footage was, to me, surprisingly strong. I was already outraged by the report, but the body cam took it to another level, from intellectual, rational outrage, to something much more visceral. It gave me much more appreciation for why body cam footage needs to be made public: a picture (or video) is truly worth a thousand words, and grabs hold of you in a way that words don\u2019t. We need to do our utmost to provide police with better training and guidance, and to incentivize municipalities to do so through legal court cases that punish police excessive use of force when police mess up. And we need to get cities to deploy body cam footage widely and release it publicly, when the family of the victim allows, to address abuses.\u00a0\nWould love to get your feedback on what you found most useful about this edition of the \u201cWise Decision Maker Guide\u201d - simply reply to this email.\nDecisively Yours,\nDr. Gleb\n \nDr. Gleb Tsipursky\nCEO of Disaster Avoidance Experts\nPS: Are we connected on LinkedIn?

They have already made large cuts to DEI programs. One of the major fears disadvantaged businesses face is how these changes will affect the 8(a) program, and should they even bother to join?\nPast 8(a) Environment\nDuring the Biden administration a pledge was made that the administration would increase the amount of federal procurement from the 5% congressionally mandated goal to 15%. Let\u2019s look at what the reality was for 8(a) spending levels in 2024.\nRESULTS:\n Eligible non-discretionary federal business sales for 2024 were $637 billion. The 8(a)-program accounted for $37 billion of these dollars or 5.8% of eligible federal sales. Very strong results for the 8(a) program however a large gap remained between the prior 5% target and the 15% the Biden administration was wanting to achieve. But on a firm-by-firm basis this resulted in a very sizeable average sales figure of $6.4 million dollars.\nFuture of 8(a) Program\nSBA Kelly Loeffler Day One Priorities:\nhttps://www.sba.gov/article/2025/02/24/sba-administrator-loeffler-issues-memo-day-one-priorities\nContained in this memo is the following pertinent language as it relates to the 8(a) program:\n13.Promoting fair competition by returning 8(a) contracting goals to statutory levels: \nThe previous Administration increased the 8(a) federal contracting goal for Small Disadvantaged Businesses to an all-time high of 15%. This action unfairly tipped the scales against any small business that did not qualify as \u201cdisadvantaged,\u201d negatively impacting many veteran-owned small businesses. As part of a broader effort to support competition and equal access to federal contracting for all small business owners, SBA has returned the 8(a) SDB contracting goal to its statutory level of 5%.\nThis would result in average sales per 8(a) firm of $5.4MM\nThis basically returns the 8(a) program to its 2023 numbers. However, what we are currently seeing in the marketplace is a reluctance for 8(a) firms to join the program because many fear the 8(a) program is going away and based upon the Loeffler Memo this should not be a concern.\nAdditionally, because of Covid 8(a) firms received an additional year in the 8(a) program. Therefore, even if the number of firms applying each year stays the same, and this is doubtful, the 5,800 figure is likely to decrease by 10% over the next few years. Less firms with the same federal spending with 8(a) firms will also increase the 8(a) per firm\u2019s average sales.\nContrarian Thinking\nWe have interviewed federal buyers in the past that simply put rely on the 8(a) program\u2019s sole source capabilities to make quick purchases. Without this ability many of the smaller procurements would take much longer and have a much higher administrative burden. Simply put, the federal government needs the 8(a) program to function efficiently.\u00a0\nThe old stock market saying \u201cbuy when the blood is in the streets\u201d may hold true for the 8(a) program as it currently sits. Over the next six months we foresee things returning to normal with the 8(a) program and those firms that acted now will be well ahead of the game!\nMark Ryan & Todd Luttenegger\n859-442-3300\nwww.ez8a.com\nez8a\n10500 Norbotten Dr\nFlorence Kentucky 41042\nUnited States \nYou are subscribed to this email as monica@lcwmail.com.\nClick here to modify your \npreferences\n or \nunsubscribe\n.",

    "body": "Survey reveals the views of consumers.\nDo school payment systems impact the education experience? New research suggests they can.\nThe education payment ecosystem extends far beyond tuition. It can include paying for extracurriculars for high schoolers, cafeteria lunches for grade schoolers or room and board for undergrads. As a result of these myriad touchpoints, school payment systems have the ability to affect the student experience.\u00a0\nTo learn more \nabout the evolving payment preferences in education, American Express and Forbes Insights asked consumers to evaluate their experience making education-related payments over the past six months. \nHere are five key findings:\u00a0\u00a0\n1. MULTISTEP PAYMENT PROCESSES CAN TURN OFF CONSUMERS\n41% of consumers feel frustrated when multiple steps are involved in making an education-related online payment, \nand 21% said the process took too long.\n2. NEARLY HALF REPORTED PAYMENT PROBLEMS\n46% of consumers reported a range of issues when making their payment in the last six months, \nincluding 14% who said they failed to complete an online, email or text payment.\n3. FRUSTRATION ALSO ARISES WHEN CREDIT CARDS AREN\u2019T ACCEPTED\n48% of consumers said they feel frustrated when credit card payment options are not offered.\n4. PREFERRED PAYMENT METHODS MATTER TO CONSUMERS\n86% of consumers said it\u2019s important that their education provider offer the payment method they prefer,\n and 67% said they would set up recurring payments or autopay if given the option.\n5. LIMITED PAYMENT OPTIONS MIGHT AFFECT STUDENT RETENTION \nNearly 1 in 4 consumers would consider switching education providers, including camps and extracurricular activities, if they couldn\u2019t use their preferred method. \nInstitutions that fail to offer payment options risk more than delayed payments: They potentially risk losing students altogether.\nWHAT THE DATA TELLS US\nEducation payment systems need to accommodate the payment preferences and varying needs of the students and parents who rely on them. Consumers most of all want a simple process when paying with the method they most prefer. \n\u00a0 \nGetty Images\nConsumer Choice: The Case For Streamlined Payment Solutions In Non-Retail Industries\nFor perspective into all seven industries studied in the nationwide consumer survey conducted by American Express and Forbes Insights, read our complementary report.\nExplore the Report\n \nSURVEY METHODOLOGY\nAmerican Express and Forbes Insights asked 687 consumers to evaluate their preferences and pain points when making education-related payments over the past six months. The exploration was part of a larger, comprehensive survey of 2,507 U.S. based consumers across key non-retail industries.\n \nUnsubscribe\n from Forbes Special Editions.\nManage Email Preferences\n \nMy Forbes Account\n \u00a0|\u00a0 \nNewsletters\n \u00a0|\u00a0 \nHelp\n \u00a0|\u00a0 \nPrivacy\nForbes Media 499 Washington Blvd. Jersey City, NJ 07310",

However, recent abrupt changes in public policy, sentiment, and discourse have introduced tension and uncertainty regarding sustainability and other social impact initiatives, as well as the communications surrounding them.\nCurrently, companies and organizations are attempting to navigate these challenging conditions by adopting various strategies\u2013from maintaining their commitments to simply rebranding or renaming their policies to fully abandoning initiatives\u2013each presenting its own distinct advantages and disadvantages. During this unprecedented period, how should we, as communicators, adjust our approach to sustainability and social impact communications and marketing when fear and uncertainty are muddying the waters?

    "body": "Hello all:\nMy name is Monica Marcel (mom to Ash, 2028) and our family is new to DePaul College Prep. It's great\u00a0to be a part of this community and we are excited for the season.\nAndrea Gosz (mom to Andrew, 2028) and I are JV Team Parents this season, and if any of you would like to join us in this role please reach out!\u00a0\nOur understanding from Coach Hinkamp is that Team Parents' primary role is to help coordinate meals/snacks, etc. Coach asked us to stay away from greasy foods, to remember any dietary restrictions boys may have, and mentioned that meals/snacks are not something we have to do for every game.\u00a0\nWith that guidance in mind: we were thinking that Crustables, protein bars and Gatorades would be fine most days, with an occasional Jersey Mike's or Jimmy John's delivery thrown in; for example, on a day when the\u00a0bus leaves school right at 3pm for a further away field, since kids won't have time to grab something.\nSince both Andrea and I are new to what JV baseball parents at DCP might have done in years passed, we'd really appreciate hearing any particular\u00a0traditions, expectations, or experiences you think we might build on or incorporate.\u00a0\nTo cover costs for the 20 boys on the roster and 30+ games on the schedule, we could:\u00a0\nUse a SignUp Genius for each family to choose particular games to be individually responsible for\nCollect funds upfront from all families, for Team Parents to then draw from to cover as many games as best we can\nSo to recap:\nPlease let us know if you'd like to join as Team Parent and/or if you have particular ideas for making the 2025 JV season special\u00a0\nPlease let us know if your child has any dietary restrictions.\u00a0\nIf you have a preference between 1 and 2 above for covering costs -- or if you have another ideas whatsoever -- please let us know that as well\nWe'll get to work on making our plan this week and get something out to you asap.\u00a0\nLook for this same message on Game Changer, to ensure 'all our bases are covered' (pun fully intended!!!).\nThank you! And #GoRams\nMonica and Andrea",

    "body": "Plus, a new history of Lollapalooza. Here\u2019s what you need to know today.\n \n.\nTo view this email as a web page, click \nhere.\nMonday - March 24, 2025\nToday's \nRundown\n is brought to you by WBEZ members and\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\nby Bianca Cseke\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\nGood afternoon! It\u2019s Monday, and I\u2019m back after visiting five countries in two weeks. Here\u2019s what you need to know today.\n\u00a0 \n1.\nHealth coverage for Chicago-area immigrants is threatened in Gov. JB Pritzker\u2019s budget proposal\n\u00a0\nNearly 33,000 Illinoisans without legal status \u2014 including 22,000 in Cook County \u2014 could be left without health care if lawmakers approve a plan to eliminate a costly program that has covered thousands of people since COVID-19 hit, my colleagues Elvia Malag\u00f3n and Mitchell Armentrout report.\nThe state\u2019s Health Benefits for Immigrant Adults provides health insurance for immigrants between the ages of 42 to 64, but costs have ballooned while Illinois faces a massive overall budget shortfall. Pritzker\u2019s office estimates cutting the benefits will save $330 million.\nBut a broad coalition of groups aims to get immigrant adult coverage back into the budget, saying fewer people with coverage means longer wait times for care. That, in turn, means higher costs and thin resources stretched thinner, according to Cyruss Winnett, chief public affairs officer of the Illinois Primary Health Care Association.\n\u201cEverybody needs to be clear-eyed about the implications this decision will have on our service capacity and our ability to meet the needs of our communities,\u201d Winnett said. [\nChicago Sun-Times\n]\n2.\nDoctors and patients are battling long COVID five years on\n\u00a0\nSymptoms like dizziness, brain fog and extreme fatigue still plague about 1 in 5 U.S. adults who have had COVID-19, according to The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.\nAs my colleague Araceli G\u00f3mez-Aldana reports, medical experts at Chicago\u2019s Shirley Ryan AbilityLab hope their comprehensive approach can provide solace to the invisible toll long COVID takes on their patients.\nMarie Saxon, a senior speech-language pathologist, and her team use what they call \u201cpacing\u201d or \u201csymptom management.\u201d\n\u201cWe try to figure out what that means for each person,\u201d Saxon said. \u201cSo, that might mean for someone, I can work on my spreadsheet for 90 minutes, but then I start making mistakes, I start getting a headache. So, we need to figure out what that break is and then how soon after can you return to that activity.\u201d [\nWBEZ\n]\nSPONSOR MESSAGE FROM POLYMATH UNIVERSITY\nPolymath University: Enroll in Summer or Fall Courses Now\nLegacy higher education offers a business model from the 1950s and an educational model from the 1880s. We've built a new nonprofit university in Chicago from the ground up \u2013 Polymath University \u2013 that is interdisciplinary, apprenticeship based, and debt-free. We call it, \"ROTC for the private sector\" and we're launching our first Master's level courses this Summer.\nRegister for a Systems Thinking course this summer\nAttend an info session\nFollow us on LinkedIn\n3.\nMayor Johnson accepted campaign contributions from a lawyer whose firm has pending lawsuits against City Hall\n\u00a0\nChicago lawyer Antonio Romanucci has become a relatively well-known civil rights and personal injury attorney, handling high-profile lawsuits including the one that led to a $27 million settlement for the family of George Floyd.\nAs my colleague Robert Herguth writes for the Chicago Sun-Times, Romanucci & Blandin, LLC, represents clients in nine pending lawsuits against City Hall.\nEven though the city\u2019s Law Department often helps decide if and how to settle these legal cases, Johnson continues to accept campaign contributions from Romanucci and other employees of his law firm, records show.\nWhile the mayor is not supposed to accept campaign donations from city contractors under municipal ethics rules, there\u2019s no prohibition on taking campaign cash from lawyers. [\nChicago Sun-Times\n]\n4.\nChicago\u2019s piping plover monitors help the endangered birds feather the nest at Montrose Beach\n\u00a0\nAs winter ends, piping plovers will soon return to their nesting grounds in Chicago, which means monitors are finishing their preparations and new members are being trained, Rafaela Jinich reports for the Chicago Sun-Times.\nDuring nesting season, usually May until August, more than 100 volunteers take turns in two-hour shifts from 6 a.m. to 8 p.m., keeping an eye on the birds, ensuring their nesting sites remain undisturbed and engaging with the public.\n\u201cThere\u2019s something special about these birds. They\u2019re so small, so vulnerable, and yet they travel incredible distances and return year after year,\u201d said Eden Essex, who has been monitoring since plovers returned to Chicago in 2019. \u201cOnce you start watching them, you can\u2019t help but care.\u201d [\nChicago Sun-Times\n]\n5.\nA new book about Lollapalooza is an entertaining history of the rise of alternative rock\n\u00a0\nLollapalooza: The Unscripted Story of Alternative Rock\u2019s Wildest Festival\n includes hundreds of interviews with musicians, promoters and others, The Associated Press reports.\nWhen Lollapalooza was introduced in 1991 as a traveling music festival, \u201cit was as if a switch had been flipped,\u201d authors Richard Bienstock and Tom Beaujour write. Conceived as a farewell tour for Jane\u2019s Addiction, the festival introduced audiences to acts such as Pearl Jam, Rage Against the Machine, Smashing Pumpkins and Soundgarden.\nThe book also details the work that went into producing a traveling festival (an unusual concept at the time), Lollapalooza\u2019s use of a second stage for additional acts to play and the village set up to introduce festivalgoers to political and cultural advocacy.\nPerhaps most jarring in 2025: the $27.50 ticket price for the inaugural festival in 1991. [\nAP\n]\n\u00a0\nHere's what else is happening\n\u00a0\nConcerns about espionage are rising as President Donald Trump and Elon Musk fire thousands of federal workers with inside knowledge of the government. [\nAP\n]\nGenetic testing company 23andMe filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy, raising questions about where its troves of genomic data will end up. [\nAP\n]\nMia Love, the first Black woman elected to Congress as a Republican, has died at 49. [\nKUER\n]\nTokyo\u2019s official cherry blossom spotters have confirmed the first blooms of the season. [\nAP\n]\n\u00a0\nOh, and one more thing...\n\u00a0\nIt\u2019s easy to overlook the Yukon, on the southwest corner of Clark and Van Buren streets, because the building is overshadowed by the Metropolitan Correctional Center, the triangle-shaped high-rise jail built in 1975.\nBut from one particular vantage point (two stories up, on the exit stairs from the elevated CTA stop at LaSalle and Van Buren), you can see its story unfold, WBEZ contributor Dennis Rodkin writes for \nReset\n.\nThe Yukon is a two-story structure built in 1898 by the Boston-based real estate investor who also put up the Rookery, the Monadnock and the Marquette in Chicago. The family that\u2019s owned the Yukon for more than half a century put it up for sale. Now, the property taxes are delinquent and at least three tenants have vacated their spaces in recent months. [\nWBEZ\n]\n\u00a0\nTell me something good\n\u00a0\nI was just in India and saw the Taj Mahal, and it absolutely lived up to the hype as one of the most beautiful buildings in the world. That has me wondering, what\u2019s something that left you in awe while traveling, whether it\u2019s an iconic landmark or a unique experience?\nFeel free to email me, and your response may be included in the newsletter this week.\nThanks for reading and have a nice night! I'll see you tomorrow.\n\u2014 Bianca Cseke\nThe Rundown is reader-funded.\u00a0\nYour gift of any amount helps power this newsletter and all of WBEZ\u2019s reporting.\u00a0\nDONATE TODAY\n\u00a9Chicago Public Media Inc 848 East Grand Ave, Navy Pier Chicago, IL 60611\nUnsubscribe\u00a0from The Daily Rundown\n\u00a0| \nPrivacy Policy",

And a positive one at that.\n\u00a0\nI knew classroom teaching wasn\u2019t my sweet spot, but I dabbled in it on three continents before I found my way to transformational training and facilitation for adults, and a few years later when I became MBTI and coaching certification Sparks of Change was born. I\u2019ve long known I am not the one to lead the movement, but my role is to support and spark, if you will, others to be and do their best. And, in the past two years a new identity emerged as I became a trauma-informed coach and healer, developing myself into a somatic and spiritual leader.\nAs coach, facilitator, trainer, instructional designer and healer\u2014my role is to help people get along just a little better. Corny factor acknowledged, this is my bit towards world peace.\u00a0\nPsst:\n\u00ad\nRead the gory details of my journey summarized in pithy bullet points.\n\u00ad\nAbout Me\n \nLast summer I started itching to figure out how to communicate the common thread to my roles and skills.\u00a0\u00a0\nThus, with help from the amazing folks at \nPerspektiiv\n, \nI am thrilled to launch the new Sparks of Change website!\n\u00ad\nCheck it out now!\u00a0\n \n\u00ad\nI facilitate connection\n\u00a0to yourself, to others and with Spirit.\u00a0\u00a0\nI take a holistic and inclusive approach to wellness, experiential learning and facilitation for individuals and groups interested in transformation and wellbeing.\u00a0\nPromo code: CONNECTION\nTo celebrate and be of service to those who know me and those will be new, \u00a0I am gifting everyone a deep discount to come work with me.\u00a0\n\u00a0\nUse code CONNECTION for a 25% discount on any offering. Must be purchased by April 15, 2025 but you can schedule sessions for any time, they won't expire.\n\u00a0\nThis is heart work, I offer a money back guarantee if you are not satisfied.\u00a0\n\u00a0\nLet's Connect Now\n\u00ad\nI would love to support and learn along with you,\u00a0\n\u00a0\nJoayne Nicole\u00a0\n\u00ad\nSparks of Change\n4509 Oakland Ave, 55407, Minneapolis\nThis email was sent to\u00a0\nmonica@lcwmail.com\nYou've received it because you have indicated interest or subscribed.\nView in browser\n | \nUnsubscribe",

    "body": "Get your tickets today!\n \nONE MONTH AWAY!\nJoin Seph Schlueter on his first headline tour with special guest Jamie MacDonald, featuring songs from his debut EP, Counting My Blessings. Rooted in his journey of faith and shaped by years of worship leading, Seph\u2019s music offers a simple but powerful message of hope. Don\u2019t miss this opportunity to hear Seph live as he shares his journey, his songs, and his prayer for revival.\nThursday, April 24, 2025\nMoraine Valley Church\nPalos Heights, IL\nBUY TICKETS\n \n\u200a\nABOUT SEPH SCHLUETER\nFor artist and songwriter Seph Schlueter, his debut single \u201cCounting My Blessings\u201d hitting No. 1 on Spotify Brazil\u2019s Viral Playlist was beyond unexpected. It\u2019s a story covered in God\u2019s fingerprints, one Seph is all too happy to share. As a young high school graduate, Seph joined a missionary group/youth retreat in Ohio as a worship leader. \u201cI gave my life to the Lord in high school,\u201d Seph shares, \u201cand made the decision to give Him my whole life. I joined Damascus to be a part of bringing revival to the Catholic church, for students and families to have a real encounter with Jesus.\u201d As he grew in leadership at Damascus, Seph was also developing his songwriting skills. The more he wrote, the more his songs gained traction within the Damascus and Catholic community. Friends encouraged him to send his songs to record labels in Nashville. \u201cI didn\u2019t know anyone in the music industry or where to send my music. An artist I followed on Instagram made a post thanking a bunch of people at her label, so I wrote down all their names and sent my song to them as well as a bunch of artists I looked up to. That usually doesn\u2019t work too well,\u201d Seph jokes. For Seph, launching Counting My Blessings on the heels of a viral hit only adds to his prayer for these songs. \u201cI hope this EP gives people a framework for Jesus. These songs are my loaves and my fish for the Lord. If He wants to multiply it, that\u2019s great. Multiplication isn\u2019t my job, faithfulness is. If no one on earth heard my songs but only heaven sang them, that would be enough.\u201d \nBUY TICKETS\n \nABOUT JAMIE MACDONALD\nJamie MacDonald is living her dream as a signed artist with Capitol Christian Music Group, creating music that inspires and uplifts. With a soulful voice and raw, heartfelt lyrics, songs like \u201cA Million Chances\u201d and \u201cDesperate\u201d tell stories of redemption and hope, drawn from her own journey. That journey hasn\u2019t been easy. Raised in Michigan in a chaotic home, Jamie faced loss, addiction, and heartbreak. A church camp as a pre-teen offered her a glimpse of hope, but she struggled for years, falling into addiction and losing her way. It wasn\u2019t until she cried out to God in her darkest moment that her life began to turn around. Since then, Jamie has poured her faith and story into her music. Along the way, she worked in prison ministry, and found her authentic sound in Gospel-inspired melodies. Now back in Nashville\u2014the city where she was born\u2014Jamie\u2019s music is a beacon of hope for anyone searching for their own second chance. \nBUY TICKETS\n \n\u200a\n\u200a\n\u200a\nImportant Ticket Info:\u00a0\nThere has been an increase in fraudulent and unlawful scams around concert ticket sales online.

Working While Black \nRacism and Black women in the workplace \n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n \nHello friends, \nAs a Black woman in corporate, or in any office job, you're always under scrutiny. Heck, as a Black woman existing and minding your own business, the same is true. \nDowngraded For Being Quiet\nI learned that for the first time at a training day in England. I've told the story before, but here it is in a nutshell. I was quiet throughout the day, as the trainer wasn't telling me anything I didn't know - no point in taking up airtime when there were people who needed the input more, I thought. \nHaving aced the tests when the training finished, I discovered that the trainer thought that my silence equated to ignorance rather than knowledge. In other words, I'd been under scrutiny, and he'd drawn the wrong conclusion. It was a lesson I wouldn't forget. \nIt's one of the reasons why, even in the discomfort of my introversion (nothing wrong with being introverted but in my case it didn't lead to social adeptness) I constantly had to force myself to speak up and advocate for myself. Now it's easier than it would have been then, as I can use writing - for which I have a gift - as my main mode of communication. \nNot Enough or Too Much?\nReturning to the work sphere, the criticisms of Black women usually fall into two camps: not enough or too much, with a side order of microaggressions and outright racism. You can keep your head down, be good at your job, and prop up the poor managers above you in the hierarchy, and you'll still hear that you lack leadership qualities, confidence, experience and those go-getter qualities that are often prized in men and despised in women. \nBecause if you DO have any of those qualities, you'll suddenly be too full of yourself, too pushy, too confident (I got accused of this once because as a tall, long-legged woman, I strode through the corridors, even though inside I was quietly uncertain). And of course, in both cases, it can be said that you're not a team player. \nThank you for being on the free list for Sharon\u2019s Anti-Racism Newsletter.

Instead, by the time they get to their second job, they can see what's ahead with a dreadful inevitability. It's often the \"\npet to threat\n\" syndrome (the term coined by Dr Kecia Thomas in 2013, which is still all too relevant today.) \nIn fact, sometimes the \"pet\" period is pretty short. You may be welcomed into the company initially, but there'll likely be someone you report to and a close colleague who doesn't have your best interests at heart, is racist, or just hates you, and who will undermine you at every turn. \nTurn in the same level of performance as your white colleagues, and you'll be under-performing. Exceed their performance, and you'll need to be brought down a peg or two. Before you know it, you're on a performance improvement plan, and the only way to rescue your stalled progress internally is to get another job. Racism, discrimination and bias win again. \nTake Action\nAnti-racism advocates, this phenomenon is visible, if you are paying attention. So pay attention. And, if the person affected is ok with it (do check if they want your support) you can call out inconsistencies in treatment, both directly and by starting conversations that make others aware too. You can advocate for them in rooms they're not in. And you can show up consistently so they know they have some support. Don't expect trust at first, but do what you know you have to do as an active anti-racist. \nP.S. This phenomenon doesn't just happen in the office: check out the news and see how many Black women in prominent positions have been driven over the glass cliff in the past year alone and how many ridiculously qualified Black women end up out of a job simply for saying what they saw - you'll get into double digits pretty fast. \nThanks for reading. \nSharon \nAdditional Reading\nREBOOT: Why Black Women Prioritise Education \nWithout it, where would we be?\nwww.antiracismnewsletter.com/p/why-black-women-prioritise-education\nThe Triple Whammy of Being a Black Woman Introvert\nAll three can count against you in the workplace\nwww.antiracismnewsletter.com/p/black-woman-introvert\nTime to Stop Tone Policing Black Women\nBecause speaking nicely doesn\u2019t solve injustice\nwww.antiracismnewsletter.com/p/stop-tone-policing-black-women\nNote: poll feedback is private - if you\u2019re happy to share your thoughts in public, then please also \nleave a comment\n.\nWhat did you think of today's article?\n\ud83d\udd25\ud83d\udd25\ud83d\udd25I loved it!\n \u00a0|\u00a0 \n\ud83d\udd25\ud83d\udd25I liked it\n \u00a0|\u00a0 \n\ud83d\udd25It was ok\nLeave a comment \nLinda Be Learning Newsletter \nInnovative learning experiences and technologies, both human and machine \nSubscribe \nI am an\u00a0anti-racism educator and activist, the author of \n\u201cI\u2019m Tired of Racism\u201d\n, and co-host of\u00a0\nThe Introvert Sisters podcast\n.\n\u00a9 Sharon Hurley Hall, 2025.

    "body": "Fifth Edition of the World Zionist Village Newsletter\nTo view this email as a web page, go \nhere.\n \nCEO LETTER\nDear Friends and Supporters of Zionism,\nIn every generation, the torch of Zionism has burned brightly, illuminating a path for the Jewish people toward sovereignty, resilience, and unity. It was this vision that brought about the rebirth of Israel, the revival of Hebrew, and the remarkable flourishing of a people who had wandered for centuries without a homeland. Today, however, we stand at a crossroads. The very essence of Zionism is being questioned, misunderstood, and at times, even misrepresented.

But not all settings, like hospitals and nursing homes, allow live animals. Thanks to PARO, however, the benefits of a furry friend can be accessible to all. \u00a0\nPARO is a furry robot designed to mimic a baby harp seal. Sensor pads inside the robot read human touches and respond with life-like movements and sounds. Since its introduction to the public in 2001, this adorable companion has been shown to improve patients\u2019 relaxation, motivation and socialization.\nGriffin MSI currently has its own PARO in the Museum\u2019s permanent collection, and it will be on display at \nRobot Block Party\n on Friday, April 4 and Saturday, April 5 from 9:30 a.m. to 2 p.m. The two-day event features interactive displays from local robotics groups and the chance to experience PARO\u2019s healing powers firsthand.\nSee Details About Robot Block Party\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n \n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n \n \n \n \n \n\u00a0\nGriffin Museum of Science and Industry \n5700 S.

Here\u2019s what you need to know today.\n \n.\nTo view this email as a web page, click \nhere.\nFriday - March 21, 2025\nToday's \nRundown\n is brought to you by WBEZ members and\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\nby Esther Bergdahl\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\nGood afternoon! If you\u2019re looking to rescue an \nendangered historic movie house\n, consider scouting out Portage Park. As for the rest of the news, here\u2019s what you need to know today.\n\u00a0 \n1.\nChicago cops have been making fewer traffic stops, but more are ending in violence\n\u00a0\nThe fatal shooting of Dexter Reed one year ago today sent shockwaves through the city and led to promises of reform. Still, Chicago Police Department leaders have pushed officers to boost their numbers in recent years, leading to stops that put both cops and community members in danger. Last year, officers reported using force 787 times during traffic stops \u2014 the most since 2018, which was the first full year cops were subjected to tougher reporting requirements.\nTo get a better grasp of the factors that make some stops so volatile, my colleagues at the Sun-Times, alongside the Investigative Project on Race and Equity, analyzed use-of-force data, conducted interviews and reviewed court records and police disciplinary files. They found, among other things, that nearly 85% of those use-of-force incidents during traffic stops were concentrated in majority Black and Latino communities on the South Side and the West Side. Police officials declined interview requests.\n\u201cAny time the police get behind me, I cringe, you know, from the past trauma,\u201d said Eric Wilkins, 54, who is Black. \u201cYou don\u2019t know what\u2019s going to happen. Today could be that day that I get killed.\u201d [\nChicago Sun-Times\n]\n2.\nCTA, Metra and Pace say they will have to cut services by 40% in 2026 if the state doesn't intervene\n\u00a0\nThe agencies are staring down a $700 million-plus budget deficit in 2026, when federal COVID-19 pandemic grant money runs out. Severe cuts to transit would have ripple effects on the broader economy, my Sun-Times colleague David Struett reports. Nearly 3,000 transit workers could be laid off, and the Chicago area could lose $2.6 billion in gross domestic product due to increased congestion and job loss.\nThe CTA would be the first agency to run out of federal grants and reduce service in 2026, according to a report released today by the Regional Transportation Authority. Four of eight CTA rail lines would see suspended service on all or portions of the lines. More than 50 stations would close or drastically reduce service. Rail service would decline by anywhere from 10% to 25% on the rest of the rail network. Bus service would be hit just as hard: As many as 74 of CTA\u2019s 127 bus lines would be eliminated, leaving a half-million riders without a nearby bus stop, according to the agency.\n\u201cCTA\u2019s impact is going to be huge,\u201d RTA Executive Director Leanne Redden said. \u201cThere\u2019s cuts on [the] Metra and Pace side as well. Even beyond the transit riders, it affects employees. Workers won\u2019t be able to get to their jobs. Traffic congestion is going to be even worse.\u201d [\nChicago Sun-Times\n]\nSPONSOR MESSAGE FROM POLYMATH UNIVERSITY\nPolymath University: Enroll in Summer or Fall Courses Now\nLegacy higher education offers a business model from the 1950s and an educational model from the 1880s. We've built a new nonprofit university in Chicago from the ground up \u2013 Polymath University \u2013 that is interdisciplinary, apprenticeship based, and debt-free. We call it, \"ROTC for the private sector\" and we're launching our first Master's level courses this Summer.\nRegister for a Systems Thinking course this summer\nAttend an info session\nFollow us on LinkedIn\n3.\nSupreme Court uses Patrick Daley Thompson case to further limit feds\n\u00a0\nThe U.S. Supreme Court has unanimously sided with former Chicago Ald. Patrick Daley Thompson, finding that a law he\u2019d been convicted under outlaws false statements but not misleading ones, as his attorneys have long argued.\nA jury found Thompson guilty in February 2022 of two counts of lying to regulators and five counts of filing false income tax returns. The conviction ended his tenure as the 11th Ward\u2019s representative on the Chicago City Council. Thompson has already served four months in prison, and his appeal revolved only around claims that he made false statements to regulators.\nThe question Thompson raised at the Supreme Court, writes my Sun-Times colleague Jon Seidel, basically amounted to \u201cWhen is a lie a lie?\u201d Chief Justice John Roberts used the case to continue the high court\u2019s trend of putting restraints on federal prosecutors.\n\u201cIn casual conversation, people use many overlapping words to describe shady statements: false, misleading, dishonest, deceptive, literally true, and more,\u201d Roberts wrote. \u201cOnly one of those words appears in the statute. [The law] does not criminalize statements that are misleading but true.\u201d [\nChicago Sun-Times\n]\n4.\nImmigration crackdowns are leading to reports of ICE agents near Chicago Public Schools, emails show\n\u00a0\nStudents, educators and staff in Chicago schools have been on edge since the Trump administration promised mass detentions and expulsions of immigrants. In January, Hamline Elementary School in Back of the Yards became the site of panic amid rumors about the presence of Immigration and Customs Enforcement officers nearby.\nThe Chicago Tribune reports that even if ICE agents are not yet a common sight near local schools, the fear they inspire \u2014 particularly in plainclothes \u2014 has profoundly disrupted the day-to-day lives of Chicago students.\n\u201cThe teachers in the classroom are under enormous stress, because they\u2019re trying to teach a class, they\u2019re trying to get the kids ready to take their exams,\u201d said Patricia Gandara, an education professor and co-director of the Civil Rights Project at the University of California, Los Angeles. \u201c[But] kids may be crying. They\u2019ve got their heads down. They can\u2019t cooperate.\u201d [\nChicago Tribune\n]\n5.\nLincoln Park HS students say their principal \u201ccould have won a lot more\u201d on 'Wheel of Fortune'\n\u00a0\nLincoln Park High School Principal Eric Steinmiller deleted the first two emails he got from \nWheel of Fortune\n because he thought they were spam. Being on the long-running game show had never been on his radar, he told my colleague Anna Savchenko. The third email convinced him to hop on a flight to Los Angeles.\nThe \nWheel of Fortune\n episode with Steinmiller aired last night. To celebrate the occasion, he organized a watch party at his North Side high school, with some two dozen students, parents and teachers in attendance. Sitting in the auditorium, he laughed as he watched himself struggle to guess the right letters onscreen, while his opponents scored big by figuring out unexpected phrases like \u201cphoto finish your vegetables.\u201d\nSteinmiller said he was focused at the time on getting momentum on his wheel spins, which he practiced ahead of filming. \u201cMaybe I was too focused on getting a good spin,\u201d he said, which is why \u201cit kept landing on \u2018bankrupt.\u2019 \u201d [\nWBEZ\n]\n\u00a0\nHere's what else is happening\n\u00a0\nTourists from ally nations, including in Europe, are warning each other not to travel to the United States after multiple long ICE lock-ups. [\nAP\n]\nChicago postal workers join their colleagues nationwide to protest the Trump administration\u2019s likely attempts to dismantle and privatize the U.S. Postal Service, which is mandated in the Constitution. [\nBlock Club Chicago\n]\nIndiana\u2019s Department of Natural Resources has reported mass deaths of sandhill cranes from bird flu, an alarming first. [\nWBEZ\n]\nScientists may have unlocked some insights into why we can\u2019t remember being babies. [\nNPR\n]\n\u00a0\nOh, and one more thing...\n\u00a0\nFor more than a decade, Roxane Gay has been one of the most influential voices in modern feminism. Her writing challenges traditional feminist narratives, making space for nuance and imperfection in ways that have reshaped contemporary discourse.\nGay\u2019s new book, \nThe Portable Feminist Reader\n, curates a sweeping collection of feminist thought. It comes at a precarious moment, when the Trump administration seeks to erase words like \u201cfeminism\u201d and \u201cwoman\u201d from federal documents and progress on reproductive rights and LGBTQ+ protections is being rolled back. Gay, who will join WBEZ Reset host Sasha-Ann Simons for a conversation in Chicago on March 26, spoke with WBEZ contributor Elly Fishman about the process of building a feminist reader for our era.\n\u201cWriting is not something that can single-handedly save the world, but it can be a call to action,\u201d Gay said. \u201cIt can remind us where we\u2019ve been and what is at stake. Some of these essays offer practical ways to organize and mobilize, and that\u2019s part of what makes books powerful.\u201d [\nWBEZ\n]\n\u00a0\nTell me something good\n\u00a0\nThe Cubs were just in Tokyo and the Music Box Theatre is running a series on \nbaseball films\n. That has me wondering: What\u2019s your favorite sports movie?\nJeff writes:\n\"My favorite sports movie is 'Hoosiers.' It helps I\u2019m from Indiana (I live in Ravenswood now) and I was in the film due to being in the right time at the right place with high school basketball and acting/music background.\"\nBill writes:\n\"'Eight Men Out' is the best. Part of Chicago's history. Dennis Bingham's portrayal of the first base ump is realistic and mesmerizing.\"\nKen writes:\n\"'Bull Durham.' Crash's speech on what he believes is worth it alone.\"\nSusie writes:\n\u201cOne of the first movies I remember seeing was the Knute Rockne story [ed: '\nKnute Rockne, All American']\n with Pat O\u2019Brien and the famous Ronald Reagan as 'the Gipper.' I really enjoyed it as a youngster.\u201d\nPaul writes:\n\u201cFavorite sports movie? 'Breaking Away.' One of the best coming of age movies and a film every cyclist should see. The race- Yes, the Little 500 is real and pretty much how the movie depicts it- is a fun event to travel for and have a great weekend in Bloomington Indiana at IU.\u201d\nMatt writes:\n\u201cAt the risk of sounding like a middle schooler, one of my favorite filmmakers is a YouTuber. Jon Bois makes heartfelt, hilarious and highly detailed documentaries about under-explored subjects that catch his fancy, including multi-part series on woebegone franchises like the Atlanta Falcons, Seattle Mariners and Minnesota Vikings. My favorite of his docs is 'The Bob Emergency,' a tongue-in-cheek analysis of the numerical rise and fall of athletes with the name Bob that somehow becomes an incredibly moving portrait of several undersung sports figures in the 20th Century (named Bob, of course).\u201d\nThanks for reading \u2014 it has been such a pleasure writing for you these past two weeks! Have an excellent weekend, and Bianca will be back Monday.\n\u2014 Esther Bergdahl\nThe Rundown is reader-funded.\u00a0\nYour gift of any amount helps power this newsletter and all of WBEZ\u2019s reporting.\u00a0\nDONATE TODAY\n\u00a9Chicago Public Media Inc 848 East Grand Ave, Navy Pier Chicago, IL 60611\nUnsubscribe\u00a0from The Daily Rundown\n\u00a0| \nPrivacy Policy",

Since October 7, 2023, Israeli children have been forced to flee their homes, schools, and communities, facing disruption, anxiety, and trauma. To support these children, we worked with Israeli creators to publish a children\u2019s book called \"Cami Is Missing Home\"\u2014a heartfelt story that addresses the feelings of loss and adaptation faced by young evacuees.

Take a minute to \nsavor scenes\n from a Lombard cafe where patrons socialize through the night during Ramadan. As for the rest of the news, here\u2019s what you need to know today.\n\u00a0 \n1.\nCTU contract deal in sight, delaying pivotal CPS budget vote\n\u00a0\nChicago Public Schools officials and Chicago Teachers Union leaders were close to a contract agreement today as all parties appeared exasperated by protracted negotiations that have dragged on for almost a year.\nThe day after a tense meeting at City Hall in which Mayor Brandon Johnson tried to broker a compromise, the school district returned to the bargaining table with new proposals on additional planning time for teachers and extra pay for veteran educators, sources close to negotiations told WBEZ and the Chicago Sun-Times. The two sides also continued discussing the frequency of evaluations for some teachers, the third and final outstanding issue.\nThe progress came as the Board of Education postponed a crucial vote on a proposed late-year amendment to the CPS budget that would have reimbursed City Hall for a long-disputed pension payment as well as funded a CTU agreement. At the start of the board\u2019s monthly meeting, board President Sean Harden announced the amendment was withdrawn from the agenda because CPS and CTU were \u201cextremely, extremely close\u201d to a deal.\n\u201cThis morning they met and considerable progress has been made,\u201d Harden said. \u201cI\u2019m very pleased about that.\u201d [\nChicago Sun-Times\n]\n2.\nCity ordered to speed up installation of crosswalk signals to assist visually impaired pedestrians\n\u00a0\nJust 3% of Chicago\u2019s crosswalks accommodate visually impaired pedestrians and a federal judge has ordered the city to speed up installation for the rest of Chicago\u2019s 2,800 intersections.\nU.S. District Judge LaShona Hunt\u2019s proposed remedial order is aimed at resolving a lawsuit filed nearly five years ago by the American Council of the Blind of Metropolitan Chicago. The lawsuit accused the city of violating Title II of the Americans for Disabilities Act by failing to equip signalized street intersections with accessible pedestrian signals. The judge\u2019s order mandates the city to install the devices \u201cat a minimum of approximately 71% of signalized intersections\u201d by Dec. 31, 2035, and five additional years to hit the 100% mark.\n\u201cAs our populations age \u2014 as we see more and more Chicagoans with disabilities \u2014 this can\u2019t continue to be a marginal investment,\u201d Ald. Daniel La Spata, 1st Ward, told my Sun-Times colleague Fran Spielman. \u201cThis has to be something we take seriously as a city.\u201d [\nChicago Sun-Times\n]\nSPONSOR MESSAGE FROM SPLOOT VETERINARY CARE\nSploot: Redefining Vet Visits, One Tail Wag at a Time\nSploot is more than a vet\u2014it\u2019s a new kind of pet care.

Madigan is scheduled to be sentenced June 13, four months after his historic conviction for a bribery conspiracy and other crimes, my Sun-Times colleague Jon Seidel reports. In February, a jury found Madigan guilty of a nearly decadelong bribery conspiracy involving ComEd.\nJurors also convicted him of a plot to install former 25th Ward Ald. Danny Solis on a state board in exchange for Solis\u2019 help securing private business for Madigan\u2019s law firm. However, they couldn\u2019t agree whether to find Madigan guilty of a broad racketeering conspiracy, in which he was accused of turning his political empire into a criminal enterprise.\nU.S. District Judge John Blakey confirmed he also intends to hold a forfeiture hearing on June 9 that could result in a financial judgment against Madigan, who was the longest-serving state House leader in the United States. [\nChicago Sun-Times\n]\n4.\nComparing 3 Bears stadium proposals in Arlington Heights, Bronzeville and the lakefront\n\u00a0\nAfter decades at Soldier Field, the Bears have their sights set on a new stadium that brings their facilities and capacity into the 21st century. The only question is where they\u2019ll be able to build it.\nWith only eight years left on the Bears\u2019 Soldier Field lease, the NFL team has started to entertain proposals that would keep it near the lakefront or even send it to the northwest suburbs, where the franchise currently owns the property of the now-closed Arlington Park racetrack.\nThe Bears and public officials have not come to terms yet on any stadium deal, but developers and the team are pushing bold (and expensive) ideas. All of them involve moving the Bears into a world-class stadium with a dome. My colleagues at the Sun-Times have sized up the pros and cons of the three most prominent proposals \u2014 Arlington Heights, the museum campus lakefront and the former Michael Reese hospital site in Bronzeville. [\nChicago Sun-Times\n]\n5.\n\u2018Lakshmi\u2019 could be the next surprising romantic comedy set in Chicago\n\u00a0\nPuja, a Chicago-area actress, writer and director, is working to develop a new romantic comedy that she feels will speak to her fellow Gen Xers, especially immigrants aging in the U.S.\n Lakshmi\n focuses on falling in love later in life; Puja dreamed up the story after wondering about widowhood. The script made it to the quarterfinals of a prestigious screenwriting competition and has attracted the interest of prolific Indian actress Neena Gupta for the lead role.\nThe story begins when 60-year-old Lakshmi, recently widowed and living in Chicago, finds a surprise romance with fun, spiritual and chaotic Tom. Jim Carrey has been floated for Lakshmi\u2019s newfound love, while Bollywood star Aamir Khan could play a supporting role, Puja told Block Club Chicago.\n\u201cIf you had an arranged marriage and then you, like, stumble into first love at 60 years old, that\u2019s hilarious and a lot,\u201d she said. \u201cI feel like it\u2019s enough to just navigate falling in love when you\u2019re young \u2026 and then there\u2019s this other idea [that] it\u2019s never too late.\u201d [\nBlock Club Chicago\n]\n\u00a0\nHere's what else is happening\n\u00a0\nCoyote vs. Acme\n, a completed Looney Tunes film with a big-name cast that Warner Bros. shelved for tax incentives in 2023, may soon see the light of day.

Morgan\u2019s band The Hush Sound toured with Fall Out Boy while Morgan was still a suburban Illinois high schooler in the mid-aughts. She went on to create a number of projects, from solo band Springtime Carnivore to a punk cover album with LA rocker Katy Goodman.\nThe multi-instrumentalist-slash-vocalist joined Vampire Weekend as a touring member in 2018, even joining for the band\u2019s Lollapalooza set that year. But Morgan\u2019s voice \u2014 her livelihood \u2014 would soon be altered by COVID-19. Five years ago this month, the Oak Brook\u2013raised singer contracted the virus, which she believes happened during a festival in\u00a0Okeechobee, Florida, where she performed with Vampire Weekend.\nIn her forthcoming memoir \nThe Lost Voice\n, Morgan chronicles how the disease left her voice impaired. \u201cThe top half of my range became inaccessible,\u201d she said, \u201cand I began to feel like a stranger in my own body as well.\u201d Now a participant in the Mayo Clinic\u2019s long COVID treatment program, Morgan is still navigating all of the ways that COVID has shaped her art and life writ large. [\nWBEZ\n]\n\u00a0\nTell me something good\n\u00a0\nThe Cubs are in Tokyo and the Music Box Theatre is running a series on \nbaseball films\n.

A pity.\"\n\u00a0\nPaul writes:\n\u201c\u2018A League of Their Own!\u2019 An all-star cast, memorable dialogue (\u201cThere\u2019s no crying in baseball!\u201d), and a fact-based story that even has an Illinois connection (the Rockford Peaches) - what more could you ask for?\u201d\n\u00a0\nAlison writes:\n\u201cA League of Their Own is undoubtedly the best sports movie ever. Then the miniseries with Abbi Jacobson and D'Arcy Carden that came out a few years ago was even better!\u201d\nFeel free to email me, and your response may be included in the newsletter this week.\nThanks for reading \u2014 have a great evening!

Here\u2019s what you need to know today.\n \n.\nTo view this email as a web page, click \nhere.\nFriday - April 4, 2025\nToday's \nRundown\n is brought to you by WBEZ members and\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\nby Bianca Cseke\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\nGood afternoon! It\u2019s Friday and, nine games into the season, the \nCubs\n finally play at Wrigley Field. Here\u2019s what else you need to know today.\n\u00a0 \n1.\nCar buyers are rushing to lock in deals before President Donald Trump\u2019s tariffs raise prices\n\u00a0\nChicago-area dealerships say they\u2019ve seen an increase in sales and foot traffic as the new taxes on cars assembled outside the U.S. kick in, Bob Chiarito reports for the Chicago Sun-Times.\nThe tariffs will also apply to imported auto parts starting May 3, which will add to the cost of cars made in the U.S., as well as auto repairs. The tariffs were part of a much larger move declaring taxes on imports from all countries.\nCar prices affected by tariffs will vary widely based on the automaker and the model, but the Budget Lab at Yale University estimated \u201ca loss of purchasing power of $3,800 per household on average.\u201d\nFor now, people like Katie Lopez, a 48-year-old social worker from Mount Greenwood, are on a mission to buy a car before any tariffs cause potential price increases.\nDealers across the Chicago area have been preparing the last couple of months by increasing their inventory, and car sales teams have been using the threat of tariffs to spur customers into action \u2014 with some telling the Sun-Times they\u2019ve recently experienced record sales. [\nChicago Sun-Times\n]\n2.\nA gun turned over to Chicago police wound up in the hands of a teenager\n\u00a0\nThe Chicago Police Department has used gun buybacks to get thousands of guns off the street, but at least two of them have resurfaced at crime scenes, Casey Toner, Tom Schuba and Peter Nickeas report for the Chicago Sun-Times and the Illinois Answers Project.\nA December 2023 gun buyback event was marked by excitement, confusion and ultimately chaos after one cop inventorying the weapons at a police station noticed a Glock handgun was missing. In an office full of cops assigned to inventory the guns and keep them secure, someone had walked off with the weapon.\nPolice say they found the stolen gun nearly a year later after chasing down a 16-year-old boy who had allegedly been pulling on car door handles in South Shore, about five miles from where the buyback event took place.\nThe lost weapon\u2019s journey mirrored an earlier event in which a gun turned in by a Cook County judge disappeared from another buyback in Chicago \u2014 only to resurface at a fatal police shooting in Cicero, as the Better Government Association and Chicago Sun-Times reported in 2017.\nBoth cases raise questions about the integrity and logistics of Chicago\u2019s gun buybacks, which are a key element of the police department\u2019s community policing and public relations efforts. [\nChicago Sun-Times\n]\nSPONSOR MESSAGE FROM GREATER CHICAGO FOOD DEPOSITORY\nHelping Our Neighbors\nMore Chicagoans than ever are struggling to put food on the table. 1 in 5 local households faces hunger. Proposed federal cuts to critical hunger-relief programs will make the situation worse. But you can make a difference for our neighbors. \nGifts to the Food Depository\n are now matched to provide 2x immediate relief for families, older adults and veterans reeling from economic challenges.\n3.\nFamilies are turning to the Illinois Attorney General to help bring back surgeries for transgender youth\n\u00a0\nAbout two months ago, Lurie Children\u2019s Hospital and Northwestern Memorial Hospital, stopped providing gender care surgeries for people younger than 19 after an executive order from President Donald Trump threatened to cut federal funding.\nAfter the order, Raoul and 14 other attorneys general vowed to protect access to gender-affirming care. But this week, Raoul said it would be hard to make a case Lurie and Northwestern are violating state law, my colleague Kristen Schorsch reports.\nIn recent weeks dozens of families and advocates have written to Raoul\u2019s office asking him to enforce the Illinois Human Rights Act and demand hospitals keep providing treatment, according to documents WBEZ obtained under the Illinois Freedom of Information Act.\nMany families have told WBEZ they feel betrayed and disappointed by the hospitals\u2019 actions, and they fear what other gender-affirming care the hospitals may stop next. [\nWBEZ\n]\n4.\nNine years after the FBI knocked on his door, the feds are moving to toss the charges against former Ald. Danny Solis\n\u00a0\nThe request, part of a deal Solis struck with the feds in 2018, brings his case to a stunning but long-expected conclusion and signals the end of an era at the Dirksen Federal Courthouse, my colleague Jon Seidel writes for the Chicago Sun-Times.\nThough he\u2019s been labeled a \u201cmassive tax cheat\u201d and a \u201cmalignant tumor,\u201d he\u2019s also been described as a \u201cwalking microphone\u201d and one of the \u201cmost significant\u201d undercover government moles Chicago has seen in decades. Prosecutors say he delivered \u201cextraordinary\u201d cooperation that helped them snare two of the city\u2019s most powerful politicians.\nNow, Solis appears to be square with the federal government. Barring a surprise twist, he\u2019ll walk away with his freedom, criminal record and pension intact. [\nChicago Sun-Times\n]\n5.\nIllinois Humanities faces an abrupt $1 million funding cut\n\u00a0\nThe Trump administration\u2019s cuts to the National Endowment for the Humanities could have a trickle down effect on museums, history programs and Chicago\u2019s popular humanities festival, my colleague Mike Davis reports for WBEZ.\nAmong the list of Illinois organizations that received federal humanities funding in the past three years are the Adler Planetarium, the Newberry Library, the Abraham Lincoln Presidential Library, the Art Institute of Chicago, several colleges and universities and even the city\u2019s newest cultural institution, the \nNational Museum for Public Housing\n, which formally opened today. \u00a0\nThe cuts are significant because they come midyear, when projects have been started with the promised funding, said Gabrielle Lyon, executive director of Illinois Humanities. She said she\u2019ll be watching closely to see whether the federal government will actually be allowed to pull the grant at all. [\nWBEZ\n]\n\u00a0\nHere's what else is happening\n\u00a0\nThe job market remained healthy last month \u2014 but tariffs could upend things. [\nNPR\n]\nSevere weather killed at least seven people across the Midwest and South, and more storms are expected this weekend. [\nAP\n]\nCanadians are canceling trips to Chicago over Trump, sparking worries ahead of the summer tourist season. [\nChicago Sun-Times\n]\nCook County\u2019s prescribed burn program, which was once banned, has grown into one of the largest in the country. [\nBlock Club Chicago\n]\n\u00a0\nOh, and one more thing...\n\u00a0\nBaby fever has spread throughout Brookfield Zoo.\nSome of the spring babies expected include Humboldt penguin chicks, a nyala antelope calf, a western gray kangaroo joey and Lake Titicaca frogs, according to the zoo.\nBrookfield Zoo has led efforts in a conservation program at Punta San Juan for nearly 20 years. Researchers estimate the wild population of the penguins to be under 24,000 and about 30 live in a colony at the zoo.\nThe penguins will be on display beginning in June, zoo officials said in a statement. [\nChicago Sun-Times\n]\n\u00a0\nTell me something good\n\u00a0\nWhat\u2019s the best book you\u2019ve read recently? I finally have some room on my library hold list, and I always feel like staying in for weeks after getting back from long trips.\nSusan writes:\n\u201c\nWildwood \nby Elinor Florence is one I would definitely read again. A beautifully written story of Molly, a young single mom, down on her luck, who inherits a house & farm in Canada from a great-aunt. It details her life with her non-verbal child in the Canadian backcountry-wilderness, her struggles to overcome her situation and survive her first Canadian winter. And a love story, too.\u201d\nKaren writes:\n\u201c\nFrozen River\n is the story of a famous midwife in the 1700s, how she grew as a woman and a midwife in a community that gave all advantages to the men. It\u2019s also a mystery based on her diary.\u201d\nAnd Lisa writes:\n\u201c\nThe Small and the Mighty\n by Sharon McMahon is such a fascinating and inspirational book. It really highlights the amazing ripple effects of people doing what they can with what they have and where they are at. These are stories from American history, but they reminded me that there are always important ways to make a difference in the world.\u201d\nThanks for all the responses this week! Now to decide what to add first to my library hold list.\nThanks for reading and have a nice weekend! I'll see you on Monday.\n\u2014 Bianca Cseke\nThe Rundown is reader-funded.\u00a0\nYour gift of any amount helps power this newsletter and all of WBEZ\u2019s reporting.\u00a0\nDONATE TODAY\n\u00a9Chicago Public Media Inc 848 East Grand Ave, Navy Pier Chicago, IL 60611\nUnsubscribe\u00a0from The Daily Rundown\n\u00a0| \nPrivacy Policy",

Consider the questions that fueled their creative processes\u2014How can we recreate cultural immersion online? What tools enable resilience and understanding in diverse contexts? \u2014as they transformed traditional methods into dynamic virtual experiences.

    "body": "Here's what you need to know about filing your taxes. \nView in browser\n \n \nYour Taxes and Help with Marketplace Costs\nMonica\n\u00a0\nRemember:\u00a0\nIf you haven\u2019t already filed your taxes, now\u2019s the time to do so.\n\u00a0\nAccording to our records, you enrolled in a Marketplace health plan for 2024 and got help with your premium costs. You must file a federal income tax return for 2024 using information from the Form 1095-A we mailed to you. This is true even if you don\u2019t normally have to file. To get an electronic copy of your Form 1095-A, log into \nHealthCare.gov\n, select your \n2024\n application, then select \u201cTax forms.\u201d\n\u00a0\nYour 2024 tax return is how you\u2019ll compare the amount of financial help you received and the actual amount you qualify for in 2024 based on your final income. If there\u2019s a difference, it might affect the size of your refund or how much you owe on your tax return.\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\nImportant:\n File your income tax return by the \nApril 15, 2025 deadline\n using the information on Form 1095-A we provided by mail or online. If you don\u2019t do this, you might lose your help with premium costs in the future.\n\u00a0\n\u00a0The\n \nHealthCare.gov\n Team\n\u00a0\nP.S.\n Many people with Marketplace coverage can get free help with filling out their taxes. This may include free access to tax software programs, or free in-person help.

This week, we'll explore the significance of having a GSA Schedule and why it's crucial for businesses seeking to do work with the federal government.\nB-to-B and B-to-G Sales Channels: Similarities and Differences\nWhile business-to-business (B-to-B) and business-to-government (B-to-G) sales channels share some commonalities, they also have distinct differences. As businesses scale, their purchasing processes often resemble those of government entities, with bureaucratic structures and complex procurement procedures. For small businesses, navigating these complexities can be daunting. That's where GSA Schedules come in, providing a streamlined storefront to facilitate federal government contracting.\nFederal Government Structure for Making Purchases\nSam.gov\nThink of a SAM.gov profile like having a phone number that's constantly being bombarded with cold calls. You wouldn't respond to every inquiry, would you? Similarly, a SAM.gov profile can be a necessary step, but it's not an effective way to stand out or attract meaningful business opportunities. In today's competitive market, having a robust online presence is crucial for attracting and engaging with potential clients.\nGSA Schedule\nObtaining a GSA Schedule elevates your company to the mid-tier of federal procurement, giving you a prime storefront. After investing time and effort into demonstrating your reliability, capabilities, and competitive pricing, you're now positioned to play a significant role in the federal government's procurement landscape. A GSA Schedule is a crucial stepping stone for federal contracting, allowing you to participate in the government's buying process.\nSpecific GWACs and IDIQ Contracts\nYour GSA Schedule is generating revenue and attracting new clients. As your business grows, it's essential to expand your capacity to meet the demands of larger accounts. To take your business to the next level, consider targeting larger government-wide contracts, such as GWACs or IDIQs. These contracts streamline the procurement process, reducing competition and increasing your chances of securing lucrative federal contracts.\nTeaming, Joint Ventures, being Acquired\nElite federal contractors have built a network of relationships with other trusted vendors, fostering a reputation that often precedes lucrative opportunities. These connections can lead to prime access to coveted contracts, sometimes before the position is even publicly advertised.\nWhile it may take time to reach the highest levels of federal contracting, such as GWACs and IDIQs, or even joint ventures, obtaining a GSA Schedule can quickly establish your firm in the federal market. With a GSA Schedule, you can gain a foothold in just a few months and lay the foundation for future growth. If your firm is looking to make a strong entry into federal contracting, a GSA Schedule is a great place to start.\nObtaining a GSA Schedule is a critical step in establishing your firm as a trusted and reliable partner in the federal contracting landscape. By having a prime storefront, you'll be well-positioned to capitalize on new opportunities and grow your business. If you're ready to take your company to the next level, we're here to help. Our experts can guide you through the process of obtaining a GSA Schedule and provide valuable insights on how to navigate the complexities of federal contracting.

Miles will be credited to your account 8-12 weeks after you reach the Threshold Amount. Bonus Miles may appear on your account in more than one deposit. To receive the 110,000 bonus miles, your Card account must not be canceled or past due at the time of fulfillment. Eligible purchases can be made by the Basic Card Member and any Additional Card Members on a single Card account. Eligible purchases are purchases for goods and services minus returns and other credits. Eligible purchases to meet the spend requirement do NOT include fees or interest charges, cash advances, purchases of traveler's checks, purchases or reloading of prepaid cards, purchases of gift cards, person-to-person payments, or purchases of any cash equivalents. Additional Card Members on your account are not eligible for their own offer. In rare instances, your period to spend $12,000 may be shorter than 6 months if there is a delay in receiving your Card. Also, purchases may fall outside of the 6 month period in some cases, such as a delay in merchants submitting transactions to us or if the purchase date differs from the date you made the transaction. (For example, if you buy goods online, the purchase date may be the date the goods are shipped). This offer is not transferable. If your application is not received by 04/02/2025, we will not process your application even if we later receive your application. American Express reserves the right to modify or revoke offer at any time. \u00a0\u200b\nIf you have a history of cancelling or downgrading American Express Card accounts within your first year and you cancel or downgrade your new Card account within your first year, we may not credit, we may freeze, or we may take away the bonus miles from your account. If we determine that you have engaged in abuse, misuse, or gaming in connection with this offer in any way or that you intend to do so, including if you return purchases you made to meet the Threshold Amount, we may not credit, we may freeze, or we may take away the bonus miles from your account. We may also cancel any accounts you have with us.\u200b\n2.\n\u00a0\nExpanded Buying Power\nThe portion of your account balance that is above your credit limit is due in full each month as part of your minimum payment due. You will not incur interest charges on the portion of your account balance that is above your credit limit so long as you pay the entire minimum payment due by the closing date of the billing period in which it is due. If you do not, then the penalty rate will apply to your entire balance, including any amount above the credit limit. Some\u00a0Delta SkyMiles Reserve Business American Express Card Members\u00a0who opened their accounts prior to 2/1/24 may not have the Expanded Buying Power feature on their accounts. Please call the number on the back of your card to confirm.\n3.\n\u00a0\nMiles on Eligible Purchases\n1x Mile on eligible purchases:\n\u00a0Basic Card Members will earn 1 mile for each dollar of eligible purchases charged on their Card or any Additional Cards on the Card Account.\n1.5x Miles on U.S. Shipping:\n\u00a0Basic Card Members will earn 0.5 additional miles (for a total of 1.5 miles) for each dollar of eligible purchases on their Card or any Additional Cards on the Card Account charged at merchants in the U.S. for shipping services. To earn additional miles for shipping, eligible purchases must be made at courier, postal, and freight shippers located in the U.S. Basic Card Members will not earn additional miles for shipping costs added to retail purchases or moving services.\n\u00a0\n1.5x Miles on Transit:\n\u00a0Basic Card Members will earn 0.5 additional miles (for a total of 1.5 miles) for each dollar of eligible transit purchases on their Card or any Additional Cards on the Card Account. Eligible transit purchases include purchases with train, taxicab, ride share service, ferry, toll, parking, bus, and subway merchants. Purchases of airfare, car rental and cruises are not considered eligible transit purchases.\n\u00a0\n1.5x Miles at U.S. Office Supply Stores:\n Basic Card Members will earn 0.5 additional miles (for a total of 1.5 miles) for each dollar of eligible purchases on their Card or any Additional Cards on the Card Account at office supply stores located in the U.S. Office supply stores are in the business of selling a range of office supplies, including items like: paper, notebooks, office equipment, and office furniture. Office supplies purchased at other retail stores will not earn additional miles.\n\u00a0\n1.5x Miles on purchases after spending $150,000:\n\u00a0If in any calendar year eligible purchases made on the Delta SkyMiles\n\u00ae \nReserve Business Card total more than $150,000, Basic Card Members will earn 0.5 additional miles (for a total of 1.5 miles) on eligible purchases on their Card or any Additional Cards on the Card Account made after the $150,000 threshold is reached through the end of the same calendar year. Only one accelerator will apply even if a purchase qualifies for multiple mileage categories. If an eligible purchase qualifies for a category that has a higher mileage accelerator, only the higher accelerator will apply instead of the one-half mile per dollar. For example, if you make a Delta purchase after reaching the $150,000 threshold, the Basic Card Member will earn two additional miles per dollar instead of an additional one-half mile per dollar for that Delta purchase. The close of the calendar year is December 31st without regard to the time of the year that the account is opened. This means that for the first year of Card Membership, the Card Account\u2019s time period to reach the $150,000 threshold may be less than twelve months.\n3x Miles on Delta Purchases:\n\u00a0Basic Card Members will earn 2 additional miles (for a total of 3 miles) on each dollar of eligible purchases on their Card or any Additional Cards on the Card Account charged directly with Delta where Delta is the merchant of record, such as purchases via\u00a0\ndelta.com\n, the Fly Delta app, phone reservations, or ticket counters, for upgrades, miles, seat selection, Delta Sky Club\n\u00ae \nmembership, and in-flight purchases of food and beverages on Delta-operated flights (\u201cDelta Purchases\u201d). Delta Purchases do not include in-flight purchases where Delta is not the merchant of record, such as in-flight wireless internet access and charitable contributions. Delta Purchases do not include Delta Gift Cards and purchases made at\u00a0\ndeltashop.com\n\u00a0and/or the Delta Flight Museum. Delta Purchases include Delta Vacations\n\u00ae \npackages but not other all-inclusive packages. Delta Purchases include new Delta Stays prepaid hotel or vacation rental bookings on the Delta Stays platform (\ndelta.com/stays\n). Delta Purchases include purchases of qualifying Delta, Delta Connection\n\u00ae\n carrier and Delta Shuttle\n\u00ae \nflights taken with the purchase of a fare that is eligible for SkyMiles mileage credit. For purposes of this Card benefit, \u201cDelta Purchases\u201d also includes Delta Basic Economy fares, notwithstanding that these fares do not earn SkyMiles mileage credit for travel. Full SkyMiles program terms:\u00a0\ndelta.com/memberguide \n. Additional miles earned for Delta flight purchases made with the Card will be based on the total ticket price, including base fare, carrier-imposed surcharges and government-imposed taxes and fees.\nEligible purchases are purchases for goods and services minus returns and other credits. Eligible purchases do NOT include fees or interest charges, cash advances, purchases of travelers checks, purchases of gift cards, person-to-person transactions, purchases or reloading of prepaid cards, or purchases of other cash equivalents. Miles will be posted to the Basic Card Member\u2019s Delta SkyMiles account 8 to 12 weeks after the end of each month. To be eligible to receive miles, the Card Account must not be canceled or past due at the time of fulfillment.\nMerchants are assigned codes based on what they primarily sell. We group certain merchant codes into categories that are eligible for additional miles. A purchase with a merchant will not receive additional miles if the merchant\u2019s code is not included in a reward category. Basic Card Members may not receive additional miles if we receive inaccurate information or are otherwise unable to identify the purchase as eligible for a reward category. For example, Basic Card Members may not receive additional miles when: a merchant uses a third-party to sell their products or services; or a merchant uses a third-party to process or submit the transaction to us (e.g., using mobile or wireless card readers); or Card Members choose to make a purchase using a third-party payment account or make a purchase using a mobile or digital wallet.\nFor questions about additional miles on a purchase, call the number on the back of your Card. Please visit\u00a0\namericanexpress.com/rewards-info\n\u00a0for more information about rewards.\nGeneral: \nAll SkyMiles program rules apply.

There is so much to celebrate this week!\nMinds That Think\nThis week, we are celebrating National Reading Week! Some of our 3rd - 6th graders are leading the way by sharing their favorite books in our morning meetings. It has been wonderful to see their excitement for reading and to hear the stories that have inspired them. To wrap up our week, Wildcat Buddies will meet on Friday afternoon for a special reading session together. It\u2019s always a joy to see our older and younger students bond over a good book!\nHearts That Love\nLast night, we gathered at St. Gertrude Church as our 8th graders received the Sacrament of Confirmation. It was a beautiful and sacred evening, marking an important step in their faith journey. Please join me in praying for these young men and women\u2014that they may fully embrace the gifts of the Holy Spirit and become true disciples of Jesus in all they do.\nHands That Serve\nA heartfelt thank you to everyone who contributed to making The Soir\u00e9e a spectacular success! Our annual fundraising gala netted an incredible $90,000, which will go a long way in supporting our school\u2019s mission and tuition assistance . A special shout-out to the Soir\u00e9e Committee, whose months of dedication and hard work made this event not only a successful fundraiser but also a memorable evening of community and celebration. Your commitment to serving something bigger than yourselves is an inspiring example for us all.\nAlso, a reminder that we have an early release on Friday as we head into our much-anticipated Spring Break! We hope you enjoy the time with family and return refreshed and ready for the last stretch of the school year.\nThank you, as always, for your support, faith, and commitment to Northside Catholic Academy.

    "subject": "Closing Chicago\u2019s life expectancy gap after COVID",
    "body": "Plus, spring break plans for procrastinators. Here\u2019s what you need to know today.\n \n.\nTo view this email as a web page, click \nhere.\nWednesday - March 19, 2025\nToday's \nRundown\n is brought to you by WBEZ members\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\nby Esther Bergdahl\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\nGood afternoon! Yes, some \ngnarly weather\n is coming, but so is \nChicagohenge\n. As for the rest of the news, here\u2019s what you need to know today.\n\u00a0 \n1.\nFive years since COVID, how Chicago works to improve the health of the city\n\u00a0\nWhether a person has access to healthy meals, a job and stable housing all contribute to their physical and mental health \u2014 and ultimately, how long they can expect to live. In Chicago, it\u2019s vastly unequal depending on where you live and what you look like.\nThere\u2019s a 25-year life expectancy gap between the Loop and West Garfield Park, public health data shows. In fact, researchers in 2019 found that Chicago had the largest life-expectancy gap across neighborhoods of any big city in America.\nSince the COVID-19 pandemic, in some cases, the gap has swelled, my colleague Kristen Schorsch reports. Five years later, public health officials and community leaders are working to make sure the trust they built and the lessons they learned during the pandemic to help people become healthier aren\u2019t lost \u2014 with fewer resources and a federal government that has targeted Chicago for everything from gun violence to immigration.\n\u201cPeople are really scared right now,\u201d said Daisy Gabriel, who distributes healthy foods to low-income seniors with the nonprofit Beyond Hunger. \u201c[C]lients know even if we have to purchase the eggs and it\u2019s going to cost us $4 a unit, we\u2019re going to make sure you\u2019re getting the items that you depend on and look forward to each month.\u201d [\nWBEZ\n]\n2.\nWith a critical CPS budget vote looming, a long-awaited memo is released on ways to fill CPS\u2019 deficit\n\u00a0\nThe memo, by the Baker Tilly Advisory Group, walks through all the ways Chicago Public Schools could find money to cover all expenses, particularly those associated with a pension fund that includes thousands of CPS employees.\nMy colleagues Sarah Karp, Fran Spielman and Nader Issa report that the memo dismisses the idea of cutting costs this year, noting that the school year will be over in a few months. Given the timing, the memo states, \u201cit would be difficult to generate sufficient savings to cover both the current budget shortfall and other Board obligations.\u201d\nMeanwhile, Mayor Brandon Johnson has likened himself to a parent trying to evict an adult child from the basement \u2014 only in this scenario, the overgrown kid is Chicago Public Schools and the parent is the city of Chicago.\nThe Chicago Board of Education \u201cis going to be an independent body,\u201d Johnson said at a press conference yesterday. \u201cI don\u2019t want to sound like my dad, but at some point, they\u2019re gonna have to move out. That\u2019s what this is. It\u2019s a relationship that we have to disentangle.\u201d\n\u200b\u200b\nFinding money for the pension payment has been a source of high drama since last summer. The city covered the payment for 100 years, but in 2021, former Mayor Lori Lightfoot began demanding that the school district pitch in.

This whole thing is a mission for exclusion.\u201d\nA federal complaint has also been lodged against Chicago Public Schools and the state board of education for allegedly \u201cforcing students\u201d to share bathrooms and locker rooms with transgender classmates. [\nWBEZ\n]\n4.\nWBEZ and 12 other public media stations are under investigation by FCC\n\u00a0\nPublic broadcasting stations are prohibited from running commercials. However, they are permitted to air corporate underwriting spots, which are supposed to be nonpromotional announcements that acknowledge their financial support.\nWBEZ is among more than a dozen public media stations being investigated by the Federal Communications Commission for its underwriting practices, reports contributor Bob Chiarito for the Sun-Times \u2014 an inquiry which may jeopardize federal money on which the station relies.\nThe station received an estimated $1.47 million, or about 4.6% of its total operating revenue, from the Corporation for Public Broadcasting, according to its financial statements for the 2024 fiscal year. The CPB is a private nonprofit created by Congress to help support public broadcasting. [\nChicago Sun-Times\n]\nThe investigation comes at a time when WBEZ\u2019s parent company is battling financial hardship. Thirty employees of the Chicago Sun-Times \u2014 around 1 in 5 on its payroll \u2014 have agreed to resign under buyout terms offered by the paper\u2019s nonprofit ownership in hopes of stanching persistent financial deficits.

That doesn\u2019t mean anyone should feel bummed about a staycation in Chicago, as WBEZ contributor Lauren Viera so delightfully proves.\nShe highlights places to seek out a new-to-you park or micromuseum, revisit a stunning architectural spectacle or swap your doomscrolling for a visit to the Doomsday Clock.\nAdventures don\u2019t have to be big to make a splash; consider visiting the city\u2019s smallest park, just 20 square feet on IIT\u2019s campus, celebrating iconic architect Ludwig Mies van der Rohe. If you love to squirm, pop into Lincoln Park\u2019s International Museum of Surgical Science or (\nmy admitted favorite\n) the Insect Asylum in Avondale.\nI don\u2019t want to spoil the rest of the list, but even if you\u2019ve got spring break plans outside the city, these fabulous finds are happy to see you all year long. [\nWBEZ\n]\n\u00a0\nHere's what else is happening\n\u00a0\nThe sole grandson of former President John F. Kennedy condemned the spectacle around the Trump administration's much-touted release of thousands of files related to the assassination. [\nPeople\n]\nThe parliament in Hungary, a nation loudly admired by American right-wing figures, has banned displays of LGBTQ+ pride, including the Budapest Pride Parade. [\nDW\n]\nLawyers for the Internal Revenue Service pleaded with Trump administration officials not to justify mass-firing probationary employees with \u201cperformance\u201d complaints, pointing out that contradictory evidence within the IRS would show the move was fraudulent. [\nProPublica\n]\nNearly 500 researchers into artificial intelligence believe the bubble is about to burst. [\nFuturism\n]\n\u00a0\nOh, and one more thing...\n\u00a0\nTwenty-seven years ago, master tea-blender Rod Markus started Rare Tea Cellar, his Ravenswood laboratory stocked with unusual and hard-to-find ingredients.\nThe more he tasted, the more he learned that tea is as terroir-driven and complex as wine. Black and green teas grown on specific mountains in China and Sri Lanka deliver deeply nuanced and rich flavor bouquets. Certain parcels of Darjeeling exhibit sweet, muscatel grape\u2013like notes, while shade-grown Japanese teas deliver unmatched umami. He discovered the almost haunting pine and honey qualities of hand-picked Emperor\u2019s Ceylon Platinum white tea from the highest mountaintops of Sri Lanka\u2019s Dimbula region.\nNow, Markus\u2019 Rare Tea Cellars is moving into retail at specialty grocer Piccadilly Market, which just opened in Lincoln Square. His trove of freeze-dried earthly delights, infused oils, spices, vinegars, caviar, chili pastes and aged soy sauces continue to supercharge the imaginations of chefs and bartenders at more than 1,800 high-end restaurants, bars and hotels across the U.S. and beyond.\nBut Markus\u2019 first love will always be tea, which is why WBEZ contributor Maggie Hennessy sought him out \u201cto help me up my own sad tea game.\u201d [\nWBEZ\n]\n\u00a0\nTell me something good\n\u00a0\nThe Cubs were in Tokyo and the Music Box Theatre just ran a series on \nbaseball films\n.

I love that movie, and there is bowling\u2026.\"\nCindy writes:\n\"Favorite sports movie: \u2018Harvard Beats Yale 29-29,\u2019 hands down. The documentary includes clips from the famous 1968 game, as well as interviews with players 40 years later.

One constant mission.\n When we opened our doors 20 years ago, our office looked quite different. Files were stored on CD, books and paperwork lined our shelves, a boombox provided the tunes, and a fax machine hummed in the corner. Like the physical tools we used, language itself has transformed dramatically over these two decades.\nPhrases have faded from use, slang has ridden its own roller coaster, emojis have woven themselves into our daily communication tapestry, and new technologies have integrated into the very fabric of how we express ourselves across cultures and borders.\n\u00a0\nYet through all these changes, one thing remains constant: \nthe fundamental human need to connect through language\n.\n\u200a\n20 years of connecting worlds\nFor two decades, we've been honored to serve as the bridge between languages, cultures, and ideas for our clients and their audiences. What began as a workplace language training company has grown into a human-powered, tech-driven global language partner offering:\nTranslation:\n Culturally nuanced translation that captures not just words, but meaning and intention across 75+ languages\nMultilingual research moderation:\n Bilingual moderators who bring depth and cultural understanding to focus groups and in-depth interviews\nTranscription:\n Fast, accurate transcriptions that preserve every nuance\nTranscreation:\n Creative adaptation that ensures your marketing message resonates authentically in every market\nMultimedia localization:\n Subtitling and voiceover to connect with multilingual audiences worldwide\nEach service represents a different way we help you forge authentic connections with your global audience\u2014ensuring that language barriers never stand in the way of understanding.\nLet's chat about your next project!\n \n\u200a\nConnect with us in person!\nWe're celebrating our milestone anniversary by connecting face-to-face with our community at these upcoming events:\nCo-sponsoring Women in Research (WIRe) at Quirk's\n \u2014 April 1: Join us in supporting this vital organization that champions women's voices in our industry.\n \nExhibiting at Quirk's Chicago\n \u2014 April 2-3: Stop by our booth to celebrate with us and learn how our language solutions can enhance your market research initiatives.\nSpeaking and exhibiting at AAPOR\n \n\u00a0\u2014 May 14-16: Jill Bishop will be joining the Multicultural, Multilingual, and Multinational Research panel to present \u201cBehind the curtain: How translation agencies are leveraging AI for survey localization and transcriptions.\"\n\u200a\nThe connections we've made\nWe're proud to have built relationships with organizations working across the globe:\nBut our most meaningful connections have always been with the people\u2014researchers, marketers, and business leaders who trust us to carry their message across languages with precision and cultural sensitivity.\nAt Multilingual Connections, we understand that language isn't just about words\u2014it's about creating authentic human connections that transcend borders.

While you may have recently discovered that there is a more effective way to achieve inclusive excellence, we could have saved you some time...\nHere's a few of the latest realizations that are already reflected in IDC's signature programs:\nDiversity Training should focus on skills, not controversial topics (when prior training \nhas not \nbeen provided) or general information (when prior training \nhas\n been provided).\nDiversity Recruiting should not concentrate on representation goals, but prioritize objective, fair, and holistic end-to-end talent management practices.\nProfessional standards are required for both organizations and Inclusive Excellence practitioners.\nGlobal and local business risks must be evaluated holistically (e.g., legal, reputational, financial, cultural, operational, etc.) and balanced with sustainability goals.\nDiversity is a competitive advantage that must be validated with a strong business case (i.e., making money, saving money, achieving organizational goals).\nDiversity, accessibility, and technology are the future. Organizations must prepare for a workplace and marketplace that builds on this 3-pronged approach.\nDiversity efforts must go beyond EEO categories, towards intersectional identities. Community expertise and collaboration should trump lived experiences alone.\nThe mass adoption of AI technology must integrate trust, accuracy, security, fairness, and ethical leadership. Guardrails must be used to prevent AI bias, as well as ensure that misinformation and online harassment are not normalized.\nDon't fall behind; the Diversity, Equity, Inclusion, and Accesibility landscape is evolving at lightening speed. Get credentials, become a member, collaborate with your peers, and continue your professional development journey with IDC!\n \nHurry-- This Special Ends on Thurs., Mar. 20th and Will Not be Extended!\n \n \nJoin us for IDC's Signature Train-the-Trainer Program on Mar. 26-27\n \n \nLast Chance!

Through this program, the federal government seeks to allocate at least 3% of its contracting dollars to HUBZone-certified small businesses each year, providing significant opportunities for these companies to compete for and secure federal contracts. This article examines the recent growth trends in HUBZone spending across various industries from 2021 to 2023, highlighting the sectors that have seen the most growth and outlining the benefits of the HUBZone program for small businesses.\nHow the HUBZone Program Benefits Small Businesses\nThe HUBZone program is designed to foster economic development and create jobs by providing small businesses in designated areas with preferential access to federal contracts. Key benefits include:\nRestricted Competition:\n For certain contracts, competition is limited exclusively to HUBZone-certified businesses, giving these companies an edge in winning federal projects.\nPrice Evaluation Preference:\n HUBZone-certified businesses enjoy a 10% price evaluation preference in open contract competitions, allowing them to be more competitive when bidding against larger companies.\nEligibility for Multiple Programs:\n In addition to competing for HUBZone set-aside contracts, certified businesses can also qualify for other socio-economic programs (such as 8(a) or Woman-Owned Small Business programs), expanding their contracting opportunities.\nThis structured support not only increases federal investment in underutilized areas but also enables small businesses to build a sustainable base of government contracts, promoting long-term growth and community development.\nA review of the top industries by HUBZone dollars spent over the past three years reveals significant growth, especially in construction and technology-related sectors. The following industries stand out for their substantial increase in funding:\nCommercial and Institutional Building Construction (NAICS 236220)\nGrowth:\n $1.05 billion (from $2.31 billion in 2021 to $3.37 billion in 2023)\nInsight: The largest growth in HUBZone spending has been in commercial and institutional building construction, reflecting the federal government\u2019s commitment to infrastructure development in underutilized areas. This increase likely includes investments in public facilities, schools, and community buildings, which not only improves infrastructure but also creates jobs and boosts local economies.\nOther Computer Related Services (NAICS 541519)\nGrowth: \n$604 million (from $1.62 billion in 2021 to $2.23 billion in 2023)\nInsight: The second-largest growth occurred in computer-related services, which includes a range of IT support and digital transformation services. This trend highlights the increasing federal demand for technology solutions to modernize government operations, particularly in areas such as cybersecurity, cloud computing, and data management.\nComputer Systems Design Services (NAICS 541512)\nGrowth:\n $246 million (from $809 million in 2021 to $1.06 billion in 2023)\nInsight: As the third-largest growth sector, computer systems design services also saw significant funding increases, underlining the federal push towards comprehensive digital infrastructure. These services are essential for developing customized software solutions, which are critical in making government processes more efficient and accessible.\nThe HUBZone program is more than just a contracting opportunity; it is a catalyst for economic transformation in America\u2019s underserved communities. With over $3.3 billion allocated to the top industry\u2014commercial and institutional building construction\u2014in 2023 alone, the program is making a real difference by investing in both physical infrastructure and digital modernization. For small businesses in HUBZone-designated areas, this initiative provides a competitive advantage, increased visibility, and the chance to grow by contributing to impactful federal projects.\nIf federal contracting is part of your marketing plan, EZ8A can help guide you through the HUBZone eligibility process. Navigating certification requirements can be complex, but our expertise in federal contracting can simplify the journey, helping you position your business for success in the HUBZone program.

In \npart one\n, Delvin talked about how he became a writer, and his choice to move beyond struggle stories and show Barbadian protagonists as heroes and more. Ready to dive in?\nDelvin, what response have you had to your writing?\nThe response has been positive. People are often surprised at the approaches I take to certain ideas. Whether it is the reimagining of Bajan (Barbadian) folklore characters in a fantasy setting, the intricate fight scenes that I weave using them, or the novel approach to things that should not work on paper, it is always exciting for the audience. \nI\u2019m especially happy with my prose, being smooth to read but also poetic or visceral when it needs to be. I admit I wasn\u2019t comfortable with my writing for quite some time. Despite the accolades I received when I first started, I always consider myself a student of the form. With my progress having tangible results to the reader, I am excited to see my style evolve as I continue learning and improving. \nYou've set up your own publishing imprint. Why did you make that choice, and were there any challenges and notable successes along the way?\nBeyond Publishing Caribbean was formed due to our established relationship as comic creators in Barbados. It made more sense to pool our resources and come under one banner as opposed to try to operate separately. This allowed us to reach a larger audience and have more of an impact when it came to our roster of titles. \nWe also had more control of the stories we want to tell. Not beholden to established brands and labels, we could focus on the ideas that we were passionate about and the execution of said stories. \n[Editor's note: a great point, which is why I advocate for \nself-publishing\n.]\nAs for prose, it seemed natural to expand to different products and mediums as the publisher grew. There was also the added landscape of traditional publishing when it came to fantasy novels and Caribbean novels at the time. There is an established presentation when it came to those genres and it clashed with the way I wanted the \nOffset \nnovels to look. To coincide with the comic series, I opted to add illustrations to capture key moments in the story in cinematic ways throughout the book. This was something that was not explored in the traditional space, and it is still limited to this day, at least in the Western hemisphere. \nThe biggest challenge right now is distribution. We have natural limitations being in the Caribbean when it comes to shipping and it is limiting how quickly we can scale. We have adjusted our business models to suit, but it is still a tall task in expanding our reach. \nAs for successes, Beyond Publishing has released 11 titles across multiple genres such as fantasy, science fiction, crime drama, horror and adventure. We have won several awards from the Caribbean Advertising Federation in publication, illustration and book design, along with collaborations with the National Cultural Foundation, U.S. Embassy and with international publishers such as Wise Acre Comics and Megascope Books (an imprint of Abrams Publishing). \nWe are currently working on a project with UNESCO through their Creative Caribbean grant initiative that seeks to encourage financial literacy and entrepreneurship in readers. The comic series called Loose Change is seeking to launch in August 2025, and I am excited to share this one with the world. \nEnjoyed this interview?

At the base level, I prefer to see stories that come from the source cultures rather than appropriated by someone else. I make an effort to check out any books, comics, films etc from unique regions when I have a chance because I believe they have a more authentic point of view that wouldn\u2019t be reached from the outside. \nIn the speculative fiction space, Black creators have been making strides whether there are based in the U.S or U.K or coming from African countries themselves. While this is fantastic, I believe the Caribbean has much to add to that conversation. Our unique history, character and setting allows for massive narrative opportunities. Especially, since the Caribbean is a melting pot of sorts for various other cultures. \nIf you could wave a magic wand, what future would you create for Caribbean writers?\nI would like to see established industries around the literary medium in the Caribbean. Despite the strides made from organisations such as Bocas Lit Fest, Frank Collymore Endowment and many others, I still think we should have more tangible environments to encourage creators to publish their work. \nFor example, it is difficult to find professional editors, literary agents and book designers within the Caribbean market. I am sure they exist but there is no \nWriter\u2019s Digest\n for the Caribbean that a new author can use to shop or improve their manuscript. Regional printing presses also do not have a print-on-demand model which can force new writers into massive print runs that will be a challenge to sell. \nThere is also a certain look and feel people have for Caribbean stories in the literary space. It is often rustic or abstract in their presentation, with grass-roots narratives. Some of these books are favourites of mine. However, I do think there is room to present the Caribbean in cinematic ways without sacrificing our identity to do so. It is my hope that through my series, as it grows more readers and upcoming authors would begin to reimagine the Caribbean in a different light. \nI know that for comics and even animation/film, Caribbean storytellers have been trying to shift towards this trend. There is hope for the future, for sure. \nDaily News for Curious Minds\nBe the smartest person in the room by reading 1440!

I have seen many stories that are combative against certain groups, and I understand why and the need for this. I even enjoy those type of stories from time to time. But they can have an alienating effect. I would like people to see people as human beings. The colour of our skin or our background does not diminish the human experience that we have, and stories are a powerful vehicle to show that human experience. \nThe best-case scenario is that people see the African Diaspora as being cool, without wanting to gentrify it (for lack of a better term). I have seen this in Hip Hop culture which is the most dominant in music right now. Despite it not being limited to the African-American demographic anymore, it is still a cultural leader in that space, without keeping out anyone else who may not be in that demographic. People look up to Kendrick Lamar, Kanye West, etc., across the world without insisting that rappers' music to be repurposed through a rapper of another \u201crace\u201d. I would like stories to happen the same way and I believe we are nearly there as the world opens up its access to global content. \nThank you, Delvin.

However, recent abrupt changes in public policy, sentiment, and discourse have introduced tension and uncertainty regarding sustainability and other social impact initiatives, as well as the communications surrounding them.\nCurrently, companies and organizations are attempting to navigate these challenging conditions by adopting various strategies\u2013from maintaining their commitments to simply rebranding or renaming their policies to fully abandoning initiatives\u2013each presenting its own distinct advantages and disadvantages. During this unprecedented period, how should we, as communicators, adjust our approach to sustainability and social impact communications and marketing when fear and uncertainty are muddying the waters? What new challenges are anticipated from our customers, investors, and employees?

    "body": "Plus, Lollapalooza announces its 2025 lineup. Here\u2019s what you need to know today.\n \n.\nTo view this email as a web page, click \nhere.\nTuesday - March 18, 2025\nToday's \nRundown\n is brought to you by WBEZ members and\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\nby Esther Bergdahl\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\nGood afternoon! The World Wildlife Fund announced that populations of the iconic but endangered Eastern monarch butterfly \nalmost doubled\n last year. As for the rest of the news, here\u2019s what you need to know today.\n\u00a0 \nSUPPORT THE RUNDOWN: \nYou could win a\u00a05-night trip to Thailand!\n\u00a0\nDONATE\n1.\nA Chicago church won\u2019t be planting fruit trees this spring as climate funds remain frozen\n\u00a0\nAs cities like Chicago grapple with rising global temperatures, improving the urban canopy \u2014 the layer of collective tree cover in a city \u2014 isn\u2019t just about beautifying the neighborhood. Trees help reduce air pollution and are increasingly among the most cost-effective ways to mitigate the impacts of climate change, reports my colleague Juanpablo Ramirez-Franco.\nLocal environmental nonprofit Faith in Place had plans in January to give out grants, funded by the Biden administration\u2019s Inflation Reduction Act, to 58 faith-based organizations across the Midwest. These would pay for tree planting in low-income communities and create urban forestry jobs to maintain them.\nThe Stone Temple Baptist Church in North Lawndale was ready to plant fruit trees in its community garden, providing the majority-Black community with seasonal access to pears, peaches, apples and plums.\nThen, on his first day in office, President Donald Trump signed his \u201cUnleashing American Energy\u201d executive order, which abruptly froze those payments. Faith in Place has laid off five employees after breaking the news to its partner organizations.\n\u201cIt\u2019s really upsetting that the government\u2019s not keeping their end of the bargain,\u201d Faith in Place\u2019s Rev. Brian Sauder said. \u201cWe\u2019ve kept our commitment, and they aren\u2019t keeping their commitment to us.\u201d [\nWBEZ\n]\n2.\nStricter rules around truck pollution would prevent 500 deaths a year in the Chicago area, study shows\n\u00a0\nEnvironmental scientists at Northwestern University are asking Chicago to look west for inspiration \u2014 all the way to California, where strict emissions regulations on trucks used for overland shipping have greatly reduced deaths and illnesses related to pollution. This study, reports the Chicago Tribune, projects that majority Black and Latino neighborhoods would see the greatest improvement in health outcomes, including hundreds fewer cases of childhood asthma.\nThe Illinois Pollution Control Board is currently considering a proposal to adopt California\u2019s Clean Trucks rule, which requires manufacturers of medium and heavy-duty trucks to increase their production and sales of zero-emission vehicles. However, under the Trump administration, the Environmental Protection Agency is seeking exemptions for Clean Trucks rules and similar state initiatives that exceed federal requirements. [\nChicago Tribune\n]\nIn December, my Sun-Times colleague Brett Chase looked into Mayor Brandon Johnson\u2019s commitment to Chicago\u2019s environmental issues and how shakeups at City Hall affect residents in neighborhoods like Little Village and McKinley Park. [\nChicago Sun-Times\n]\nSPONSOR MESSAGE FROM GREATER CHICAGO FOOD DEPOSITORY\nVisits to Chicago food pantries on the rise\nHousehold visits to Chicago food pantries and grocery programs have increased by 57% since 2020. And while the need keeps growing, hunger relief programs are under federal threat. As caring neighbors, you are the hope that ignites change. \nGifts to the Food Depository\n are now matched for 2x the impact to provide meals and build solutions to end hunger.\n3.\nThe Chicago Teachers Union accuses CPS of fostering disruption and chaos in not agreeing to key compromises\n\u00a0\nThe Chicago Board of Education is set to vote on a contentious budget amendment to set aside money for the teacher\u2019s contract, as well as a controversial pension payment. There\u2019s some concern among the partly appointed, partly elected board that approving the budget amendment before the teachers\u2019 contract is landed could leave the school district without enough money to pay for this year\u2019s contract costs.\nThe school district and the union have been bargaining since last April, and both sides say they are close to a deal, writes my colleague Sarah Karp. But after CPS quickly rejected a proposal to reinstate 30 minutes of teacher planning time \u2014 a major remaining sticking point \u2014 the two sides are trading accusations of sabotage.\nSources say the union is now \u201cbarreling toward an escalated conflict instead of the stability of a landed contract.\u201d The CTU has completed the legal process and can take a vote at any time that would give 10 days notice of a strike. [\nWBEZ\n]\n4.\nSabrina Carpenter, Olivia Rodrigo and Tyler, the Creator to headline Lollapalooza 2025 in Chicago\n\u00a0\nSet your reminders or get in touch with your ticket guy: Lolla turns 21 this year and passes go on sale Thursday. Four-day general admission, July 31 to Aug. 3 at Grant Park, starts at $385.\nHeadliner Olivia Rodrigo is making her Lollapalooza debut, while returning stars and new favorites include A$AP Rocky, Gracie Abrams, the Jack Antonoff-led band Bleachers, K-pop girl group TWICE, country singer Luke Combs and rising multi-instrumentalist Mk.gee.\nChicago talent also made its way onto the lineup, including R&B singer-songwriter Ravyn Lenae, who had one of WBEZ\u2019s favorite albums of 2024; Djo, the music alias for actor Joe Keery of \nStranger Things\n and \u201cEnd of Beginning\u201d fame; and the Chicago Youth Symphony Orchestra.\nLollapalooza is the largest of the summer\u2019s Chicago music extravaganzas \u2014 a summer marking the first festival season without Pitchfork, which announced it would not return to Chicago in 2025. [\nWBEZ\n]\n5.\nNew venue Bookclub revives former Elbo Room in \u201ca leap of faith\u201d\n\u00a0\nThe DIY concept of Bookclub was born out of necessity in summer 2021. As lockdown restrictions began to lift, K.O. Weakley \u2014 who makes music under the name TYGKO \u2014 was eager to return to the stage. But less than a week before he planned to perform at KIP Studios in Logan Square, the location was served a cease and desist order.\n\u201cWe knew we needed a place to play; we knew other people needed a place to play; we knew that we needed a live context for the music that we had been making,\u201d Weakley told my Vocalo colleague Nudia Hernandez. \u201cThat was the main push behind even opening a DIY spot.\u201d\nIn September, Weakley and co-founder Cam Stacey announced they had bought the Elbo Room, the famed venue which put its building up for sale and closed in 2019 after 30 years in Lake View. Bookclub opened at the end of January with live music and daytime, dog-friendly bar hours. [\nVocalo\n]\n\u00a0\nHere's what else is happening\n\u00a0\nThe ceasefire in Gaza ended after Israel accused Hamas of stalling on hostage releases and launched air strikes, killing hundreds. [\nABC News\n]\nBecause of changes stemming from the Trump administration\u2019s excising of diversity, equity and inclusion measures, the federal government no longer explicitly prohibits contractors from segregating facilities based on protected identities. [\nNPR\n]\nScientists report National Institutes of Health officials are urging them not to reference mRNA vaccines, a promising field that has implications for cancer treatments, in grant applications. [\nKFF Health News\n]\nA suburban man is bringing back an annual passion project: selling heritage tomato plants and donating to organizations that supply food pantries. [\nBlock Club Chicago\n]\n\u00a0\nOh, and one more thing...\n\u00a0\nWhen \nPurpose\n premiered at Chicago\u2019s Steppenwolf Theatre last spring, it was a big deal. Even before preview performances, there were whispers that the family drama, written by Branden Jacobs-Jenkins (\nAppropriate\n), would go to New York.\nBut the production\u2019s Broadway premiere over the weekend illustrates Chicago\u2019s keen ability to incubate shows that rouse even the center of the theater world. If the Chicago production was really good, writes my colleague Mike Davis, the Broadway show reaches another level.\nAudiences locked onto parallels between the Jasper family on stage \u2014 a father entrenched in the civil rights movement, his son juggling a political career and a prison sentence \u2014 and the family of Rev. Jesse Jackson in Chicago. But underneath the politics were relatable themes that easily connected with audiences. Both Jasper children struggle with their mental health, and Jacobs-Jenkins carefully portrays the generational differences in a Black family in understanding and addressing issues of mental health and sexuality.\nThen there\u2019s Tony-nominated actress LaTanya Richardson Jackson (\nA Raisin in the Sun\n) \u2014 and wife of actor Samuel L. Jackson \u2014 who plays Claudine Jasper, the matriarch. [\nWBEZ\n]\n\u00a0\nTell me something good\n\u00a0\nThe Cubs are in Tokyo and the Music Box Theatre is just concluding a series on \nbaseball films\n. That has me wondering: What\u2019s your favorite sports movie?\nErika writes:\n\u201cOk - you said \nsports\n, not just baseball... so I hope this is ok!\nBut anytime I hear \u2018favorite sports movie,\u2019 I immediately think of my favorite sports documentary, which is actually just one of my favorite movies of all time: the 1994 documentary, \nHoop Dreams\n. I have loved it since I first saw it MANY years ago as a twenty-something year-old. I was struck by how captivating it was and how the filmmaking pulled me into the stories of the Gates and Agee families so much so that I felt like I knew them.\nI clearly remember Siskel and Ebert championing this film on At the Movies back in 1994 (what Chicago area movie-loving kid didn't watch that syndicated show every single week since they were born?), and everything they said about \nHoop Dreams\n held to be true. Many years later, I've now been lucky to be able to teach this film as part of an English elective course for high school students, and my passion for the film, the families' stories, and for teaching only grows stronger with each viewing. I've met Arthur Agee a few times; he even generously spoke to one of my classes last semester after we studied and wrote about the film.\nAs Ebert once said, \u2018...movies are like a machine that generates empathy.\u2019 \nHoop Dreams\n generates that and so much more. We are all kinder, more understanding people after watching it. I'm so grateful to the families who opened up their lives and trusted the filmmakers - and so grateful to the filmmakers, Steve James, Peter Gilbert, and Frederick Marx, who proved to be talented and caring storytellers worthy of their trust.\nThank you for reading if you made it this far. I never pass up an opportunity to share a few words (or a paragraph) about \nHOOP DREAMS\n!\u201d\nFeel free to email me, and your response may be included in the newsletter this week.\nThanks for reading \u2014 have a great evening! I'll see you tomorrow.\n\u2014 Esther Bergdahl\nThe Rundown is reader-funded.\u00a0\nYour gift of any amount helps power this newsletter and all of WBEZ\u2019s reporting.\u00a0\nDONATE TODAY\n\u00a9Chicago Public Media Inc 848 East Grand Ave, Navy Pier Chicago, IL 60611\nUnsubscribe\u00a0from The Daily Rundown\n\u00a0| \nPrivacy Policy",

    "body": "Plus: AI Is The New Gender Gap Front In Tech | Law School Admissions Get More Competitive | Nurses Push Back on AI Patient Care\nBECOME A MEMBER\n\u00a0\u2022\u00a0\nNewsletters\n\u00a0\u2022\u00a0\nMyForbes\nIt\u2019s 2025 and corporate espionage is no longer done by sneaking contracts out of office buildings or installing malware on your competitors\u2019 computers. Now, Slack messages are the new target.\nAt least that\u2019s what work management platform Rippling has accused its main competitor\u2014global payroll company Deel\u2014of going after in a corporate espionage \nlawsuit filed on Monday\n. Rippling says that Deel hired a \u201cspy\u201d employee to steal Rippling data, including sales tactics, product pricing and customer retention strategies.\u00a0\nAccording to the suit, Rippling\u2019s \u201cspy\u201d employee shared intel on Deel\u2019s own customers who discussed switching to Rippling.\u00a0\u00a0\nRippling also alleges that the \u201cspy\u201d took employee contact information from Rippling colleagues and passed it on to Deel, which then sent WhatsApp messages to certain employees and offered them jobs at the competitor.\u00a0\nThe smoking gun moment came when Rippling\u2019s general counsel sent a letter to Deel\u2019s senior leadership that mentioned a \u201choneypot\u201d Slack channel set up specifically to catch the employee. Lo and behold, the \u201cspy\u201d employee searched and accessed the Slack channel shortly after the letter was sent.\u00a0\nBad blood has been brewing between the two companies since Rippling banned former employees who now work at competitors, including Deel and Workday, from its \ntender offer stock sale in June.\u00a0\nAnd while their products\u2013\u2013payroll systems and work management tools\u2013\u2013can be quite boring for those not working in people management, the details of the lawsuit certainly aren\u2019t. If anything, it\u2019s a reminder that your employer can monitor not only what you send on Slack, but also what channels you preview and your searches.\u00a0\nHappy reading, and hope you have a lovely week!\nMaria Gracia Santillana Linares\u00a0\nCareers Reporter\nFollow me on\u00a0\nForbes.com\nWORK SMARTER\nPractical insights and advice from Forbes staff and contributors to help you succeed in your job, accelerate your career and lead smarter.\nWhy \nmidday power naps \ncan \nincrease your productivity and strengthen your memory\n.\nFrom interviews to business deals, \nquestions are essential to any type of job\n.

It's only exacerbating gender discrepancies in tech. \n\u00a0 \nGetty\nAI Upskilling Is The New Gender Gap In Tech \nRead Report\nIn the already male-dominated tech world, a new \nreport\n by staffing firm Randstad shows the staggering gap in AI skills between men and women.\nWe\u2019ve all seen the ads for \n\u201cAI skills\u201d classes\n. From prompt engineering 101 to managing AI agents, learning how to best use artificial intelligence at your job is currently a major focus of corporate development programs.\nBut not everyone is benefitting from such opportunities equally. A new report by global staffing firm\n\u00a0\nRandstad found\n that while 71% of men report having AI skills, only 29% of women can say the same.\nEquitable access to resources and skilling opportunities is key to the global talent scarcity, Randstad CEO Sander van\u2019t Noordende wrote in the report. \u201cWhen it comes to AI, demand continues to grow at an unprecedented rate, and so does the AI equity gap it is creating,\u201d he adds. This is especially true in the tech industry, where women \nmake up only about 25% of roles.\n Whether it be in more formal LLM training or simple advice on how to effectively prompt generative AI to create a customized deck, access to AI training is quickly mirroring already-existing gender gaps.\u00a0\n\u201cTechnology scales so fast, it scales what already is,\u201d says Sree Menon, a partner at venture capital firm FalconX and founder of EmpowerHer.ai.\nBut here\u2019s the caveat: The gender discrepancy comes from employees reporting using employer-provided AI. That\u2019s not to say that there isn\u2019t an actual gap between men and women in AI usage, but is it possible that women are under-reporting their own use of the technology?\nSays Menon: \u201cI have seen women take a lot more pride in their work, and take it more personally, than men do. So when it comes to using AI, that may be an admission that I actually used help.\u201d\u00a0\nIndeed, a 2024 report by Microsoft and LinkedIn found similar results: Workers are \nreluctant to share with their bosses\n that they\u2019re using AI at work, even when it\u2019s sanctioned by their employers. Ethan Mollick, a professor at the University of Pennsylvania\u2019s Wharton School who studies AI, told \nForbes\n at the time that employees \u201cknow if they tell [their bosses] about it, then maybe [they\u2019re] not so impressed by all the amazing work they\u2019re doing. Everyone is trying to not show that they\u2019ve automated their work.\u201d \nTOUCH BASE\n \nRand Larsen has spent the past year living in a camper van, traveling the country to help small business owners connect and navigate entrepreneurship.\n \nBrandon Kochkodin\n \nNews from the world of work \nOwning a small business can be a lonely affair, especially for those pursuing entrepreneurship through acquisition, a practice that has gained traction but remains rare in the broader small business world. \nOne influencer is creating a community to help business owners stay sane,\n \nForbes\u2019 \nBrandon Kochkodin \nreports\n.\u00a0\nIt\u2019s getting harder to get into law school.\n Applications are up 20.2% from last year, according to the\n\u00a0\nLaw School Admissions Council\n, while open seats remain relatively the same. Law school applications rise during recessions, according to the \nWall Street Journal\n, or when the job market is tough, as in 2021. But this year could also be experiencing a \u201cTrump bump,\u201d as applicants follow high-profile legal battles.\u00a0\nPresident Trump\n\u00a0\nrevoked 19 executive orders\n signed by former President Biden\n last week, including actions establishing a \n$17.75 minimum wage\n for federal contractors, mandating apprenticeship programs, and what the Trump Administration called a \u201cdirective to prioritize union-driven policies that imposed unnecessary regulations on industries.\u201d\nThe Trump Administration\n continues to lay off employees as part of the president\u2019s effort to downsize the federal government. \nLast week, the Department of Education said it would \ncut about 50% of its workforce\n. But it\u2019s not certain that these employees will remain out of work, as a federal appeals court on Monday upheld a ruling ordering several agencies to \nrehire\n their laid-off employees.\u00a0\nAI nurses are facing growing pushback from their human counterparts,\n reports the \nAP\n. As companies increasingly hire AI chatbots to supposedly aid nurses with paperwork and help address a worker shortage, nursing unions say that these programs are instead generating false alarms and dangerous advice.\u00a0\nForbes\n released its tenth annual\n \nBest Management Consulting Firms list\n today, a ranking of the best firms across 16 different industries and 17 different functional areas. \nTopping the list was Deloitte\n, which received the most recommendations from both clients and other consulting partners. \nNUMBER TO NOTE\n86%\nThat\u2019s how many teenagers said it is extremely or very important for them \nto have a job or career they enjoy when they\u2019re an adult\n, more than the percentage who said the same about getting married or having children in a recent Pew Research Center survey.\u00a0 \n\u00a0\nVIDEO\nWhat You Need to Know About Trump\u2019s Student Loan Forgiveness\nWatch Video\nQUIZ\nAccording to a report by Reuters, which of the following was not part of federal workers\u2019 experience when returning to the office?\nA.\nFinding cockroaches on floors and bugs out of faucets\nB.\nWorking from a supply closet due to lack of space\nC.\nUsing a personal hotspot to access government data\nD.\nLeaking ceilings\nCheck if you got it \nright here.\nMORE FROM FORBES\nTesla Is No Longer Elon Musk\u2019s Most Valuable Asset\nRead Article\n \nHow Pam Bondi Got Rich In Just Six Years Out Of Office\nRead Article\n \nMeet The Influencer Helping Small Business Owners Stay Sane\nRead Article\n \nThere is More To Explore\n \n \nFuel your success with unlimited access to a world of inspiration unique to Forbes \u2014 including the premium content featured in today\u2019s newsletter \u2014 for just $9.99/month (regularly $12.99). \nUnlock Premium Access \n \nUnsubscribe\n from Careers.\nManage Email Preferences\n \nMy Forbes Account\n \u00a0|\u00a0 \nNewsletters\n \u00a0|\u00a0 \nHelp\n \u00a0|\u00a0 \nPrivacy\nForbes Media 499 Washington Blvd. Jersey City, NJ 07310",

For example, several recent cases resulted in fines for lawyers who provided fictitious citations that were obtained through Gen AI. In response, the American Bar Association issued Formal Opinion 512, reinforcing that ethical obligations under the ABA Model Rules of Professional Conduct remain critical when using Gen AI. Lawyers must ensure accuracy, safeguard client confidentiality, communicate AI use transparently, and uphold reasonable billing practices. \nLaw firms that want to take advantage of AI\u2019s potential must prioritize training, clear policies, and human verification.\nTo learn more, check out this\n \nblog\n.\nRead Blog\n \nPrefer video to text?

We \nreally appreciated all the energy and obvious underlying knowledge that you have related to the topic.\n All of our panelists really enjoyed hearing from you, our guests enjoyed hearing from you, and we look forward to working with you again.\u201d\n\u200c\nJay Reyes\n, \nChief Counsel at the American Bar Association\nSchedule a Free Consultation\n \nWhat's Up With Me\nMy wife and business partner, Agnes Vishnevkin, and Iwere making our plans to travel from our hometown of Columbus, Ohio, to visit my parents for my mom\u2019s 75th birthday in New York City. At the same time, she\u2019s been struggling with a period of back pain for the past two months. Her condition fluctuated, but it was worse again in the days leading up to the trip, so I suggested she should skip the trip. She was quite reluctant to do so, because she was concerned that my mother would be upset. I was surprised how hard it was to convince her to agree to stay home.\nThis is the kind of situation where she and I differ: I tend to think people will understand and forgive, while she is more worried about others\u2019 judgments. Maybe sometimes I underestimate how judgmental people might be, but in this case I think I was right. Sometimes, we need to reduce our concerns about other people\u2019s opinions and focus on our own self-care. Now, that doesn\u2019t mean being a jerk, there has to be a balance, but in this case the balance to me was clearly toward self-care. \nWhat do you think should be the balance between self-care and consideration of other people\u2019s feelings?\n\u00a0\nWould love to get your feedback on what you found most useful about this edition of the \u201cWise Decision Maker Guide\u201d - simply reply to this email.\nDecisively Yours,\nDr. Gleb\nDr. Gleb Tsipursky\nCEO of Disaster Avoidance Experts\nPS: Are we connected on LinkedIn?

    "subject": "Reminder: Learn how to use logic to defeat unconscious bias",
    "body": "Did you know that logic is a powerful tool for defeating bias?\n\u200a\n \n\u200a\n\"Overcoming Bias: A Guide to Skilled Skepticism\"\n\u200a\nDon\u2019t you love being right? I sure do. I think that\u2019s one reason most of us are afflicted with what\u2019s called \u201cconfirmation bias\u201d \u2013 the pesky habit of noticing only the evidence that proves our previously held beliefs correct. In other words, we see what we expect to see.\n\u00a0\nThis is where our biases \u2013 our inflexible beliefs about categories of people \u2013 trick us into jumping to the wrong conclusions. Once we get it into our heads that members of particular groups \u201call\u201d \u2013 because they are members of that group \u2013 share a particular characteristic, our brain just can\u2019t resist proving that bias right.\n\u00a0\nTake for example what can happen when we encounter a new team member who uses a wheelchair. Unfortunately, there is a tendency for some of us who are fully-abled to reflexively assume that a person in that situation will require extra help to perform their duties. \n\u00a0\nThat assumption \u2013 that bias \u2013 in turn means that we fastidiously notice every time he or she does, in fact, ask for help and \u2013 conveniently for the confirmation we are seeking \u2013 we fail to spot the more numerous times when that same person is utterly self-sufficient.\n\u00a0\nNoticing only that which makes us feel right may be tempting, but it sure is a bad idea if we are to see the people around us for who they really are and what they have to bring to the workplace.\n\u00a0\nSo, here\u2019s a thought: What if we adopt and practice a far-more productive habit? Namely the habit of \"skilled skepticism\". What if, every time we make an assumption about what someone is like, we pause to weaken that conclusion by dissecting its logic? Specifically, we ask ourselves these two questions:\n\u00a0\nHave I ever encountered someone who uses a wheelchair whose need for extra help interfered with my performance in some way?\n\u00a0\nThis brings us to the reality that, sure, some people who use wheelchairs do require extra help. That\u2019s real. It\u2019s not, however, \u201call\u201d as our confirmation bias tricks us into believing.\u00a0And this brings us to the demonic nature of bias. \n\u00a0\nWhen we have even one experience with a member of a group that negatively impacts us in some way -- in this case \u201cinterferes with performance\"-- the brain seeks to protect us from repeating that experience by erroneously teaching us that all members of the group in question are equally apt to put us at that disadvantage. \n\u00a0\nSadly experiences like this can cause a bias to be born. By recalling that experience and recognizing that it is an \nisolated\n incident, it brings the event into perspective and, thereby, weakens its impact on our thinking. \n\u00a0\nHow many people who use wheelchairs do I \nactually know\n who are constantly asking for help?\n \n\u00a0\nThe key phrase here is \u201cactually know.\u201d This doesn\u2019t mean saw depicted on the web or heard a rumor about. It means having had significant ongoing contact with a situation in which help was regularly sought. The answer is overwhelmingly apt to be very few if any. That answer -- that insight -- has the power to cut through your bias, to weaken it, and allow the rational brain to take over. \n\u00a0\nSkilled scientism \u2013 it works. You\u2019ll be surprised at what you will learn \u2013 not only about your colleagues \u2013 but about yourself as well.\u00a0\n\u00a0\n \nVISIT OUR\u00a0WEBSITE\n \nCLIENTS AND TESTIMONIALS\n \nCONTACT US TODAY!\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\n \n \n\u200a\nSondra is Available for\u00a0\nVirtual Presentations\n\u00a0on How to Defeat Unconscious Bias\n \n \n \nMission and Purpose:\nSondra's purpose is to meet each client\u2019s individual goals by providing practical, immediately applicable tools for defeating unconscious bias.

With a 75% rejection rate, it is critical to understand the key requirements and strategies for success. Here\u2019s a concise guide to navigating the process effectively:\nKey Requirements for 8(a) Certification\nSocial Disadvantage\nOwners must demonstrate social disadvantage, often tied to minority status.\nU.S. citizens with 100% minority heritage qualify automatically; others with at least 25% heritage must provide a detailed narrative.\nEligible groups include Native Americans (with tribal cards), Hispanics (including those of Iberian descent), and individuals from the Middle East or North Africa (with documented discrimination narratives).\nTips:\nNative Alaskans and Hawaiians are presumed eligible but often overlook their status.\nOwnership of 51% or more by the disadvantaged individual(s) is mandatory.\nEconomic Disadvantage\nOwners cannot earn more than $400 thousand annually on average (past 3 years).\nNet worth must not exceed $850 thousand, excluding the primary residence, business assets, and retirement accounts.\nTotal assets must not exceed $6.5 million, excluding retirement accounts.\nTips:\nRetained earnings reinvested into the firm or taxes paid on such earnings do not count towards the income cap.\nTo reduce net worth, consider paying down the mortgage on your primary residence.\nFully disclose all assets to avoid denial due to discrepancies found in the SBA credit check.\n\ufeff\nPotential for Success\nThe firm must demonstrate financial viability, including profitability, a positive net worth, and at least two years in business (or meet criteria for a two-year waiver).\nNot more than 70% of the firm\u2019s revenue should come from a single source, evaluated on a rolling 12-month basis.\nTips:\nOnly the 51% owner must work full-time for the business.\nA two-year waiver is possible with at least $150,000 in revenue and one profitable tax return.\nThe 70% revenue rule is waived for firms with a two-year waiver.\nControl of the Firm\nThe disadvantaged owner must manage daily operations, lead strategic planning, and typically be the highest-paid individual.\nThe firm should not share employees or office space with other entities that could indicate control issues.\nTips:\nLimit revenue from past employers to no more than 25%.\nJustify any instance where the owner is not the highest-paid employee.\nGood Moral Character\nOwners must be free of unresolved ethical issues.\nTaxes must be current, or a payment plan must be in place.\nAll criminal offenses, regardless of age, must be disclosed.\nTips:\nOffenses over 5\u20137 years old are often forgiven, but nondisclosure is never tolerated.\nThe SBA conducts an FBI background check on all applicants.\nEvery year, 500\u2013600 firms achieve 8(a) Certification, opening the door to unparalleled opportunities in federal contracting. While the process is demanding, careful preparation and adherence to SBA requirements can set your firm up for success.\nFor further assistance or questions about 8(a) Certification, feel free to contact us.\nMark Ryan & Todd Luttenegger\n859-442-3300\nwww.ez8a.com\nez8a\n10500 Norbotten Dr\nFlorence Kentucky 41042\nUnited States \nYou are subscribed to this email as monica@lcwmail.com.\nClick here to modify your \npreferences\n or \nunsubscribe\n.",

    "body": "Survey reveals the views of consumers.\nA healthcare provider\u2019s payment system can directly influence patient satisfaction and loyalty. Here\u2019s why, according to new research. \nCatalyzed by post-pandemic shifts across the healthcare industry, providers have worked to innovate their payment systems. Consumers interact with these systems whenever they make a payment at a doctor\u2019s office, hospital or for any healthcare service not covered by insurance. Are healthcare payment options meeting patient expectations? \nTo learn more\n about evolving payment preferences in healthcare, American Express and Forbes Insights asked consumers to evaluate their experiences making healthcare payments over the past six months. \nHere are five key findings: \n1. HAVING CHOICE OF PAYMENT METHOD IS IMPORTANT\n87% of consumers said it\u2019s important for their healthcare provider to offer their preferred payment method, \nand 24% said they would consider switching to a different healthcare provider if they couldn\u2019t pay with their preferred payment method. \n2. THE MAJORITY PREFER TO PAY BY CREDIT CARD \u2026\n54% of consumers prefer to pay for healthcare expenses by credit card,\n the most popular option by far.\n3. \u2026 AND THEY ARE LIKELY TO BECOME FRUSTRATED WHEN THEY CAN\u2019T\n48% of consumers said they feel frustrated when credit card payment options are not offered \nwhen paying healthcare expenses.\n4. OFFERING DIGITAL METHODS MAY IMPROVE CONSUMER SATISFACTION\n33% of consumers experience frustration when modern payment solutions are not offered, \nindicating they would like the option to pay using a digital wallet or mobile payment system.\n5. DIGITAL REMINDERS ARE MOST POPULAR BUT SOME CONSUMERS PREFER PAPER\n68% of consumers prefer an email notification when their healthcare payment is due, \nand 54% would like a text notification. Nearly half would still like a mailed statement.\nWHAT THE DATA TELLS US\nThe survey shows that consumers want convenience, and they expect choice when making a healthcare payment. When they have a choice, the majority prefer to pay with a credit card. \n\u00a0 \nGetty Images\nConsumer Choice: The Case For Streamlined Payment Solutions In Non-Retail Industries\nFor perspective into all seven industries studied in the nationwide consumer survey conducted by American Express and Forbes Insights, read our complementary report.\nExplore the Report\n \nSURVEY METHODOLOGY\nAmerican Express and Forbes Insights asked 680 consumers to evaluate their preferences and pain points when making healthcare-related payments over the past six months. The exploration was part of a larger, comprehensive survey of 2,507 U.S. based consumers across key non-retail industries.\n \nUnsubscribe\n from Special Editions.\nManage Email Preferences\n \nMy Forbes Account\n \u00a0|\u00a0 \nNewsletters\n \u00a0|\u00a0 \nHelp\n \u00a0|\u00a0 \nPrivacy\nForbes Media 499 Washington Blvd. Jersey City, NJ 07310",

Today, we\u2019ll see more than 12 hours of sunlight for the first time \nsince September\n. As for the rest of the news, here\u2019s what you need to know today.\n\u00a0 \nLet WBEZ take you to the symphony!\u00a0\nSupport The Rundown & you could win.\u00a0\nDONATE\n1.\nAmid backlash against Elon Musk and DOGE, Tesla owners say they\u2019re caught in the middle\n\u00a0\nAcross the country, authorities have reported vandalism against Tesla vehicles and dealerships. The Chicago area hasn\u2019t been immune to the backlash: Vandals tagged a new Tesla dealership in Buffalo Grove over the weekend and a Tesla showroom in the Gold Coast has been the site of protests calling for people to ditch their vehicles.\nIndividual Tesla owners are also facing outrage from all sides, reports my colleague Emmanuel Camarillo at the Sun-Times. \u201cI think you should be able to separate personal property from that,\u201d one driver said. \u201cThe people who own the property have nothing to do with what [CEO Elon Musk] did, and most of us bought the car before Elon went rogue.\u201d\nEddie Zipperstein, owner of Richard\u2019s Body shop in Albany Park, said his store had serviced four vandalized Teslas in the last couple of months. The vandalism to those cars included damage from eggs and one case in which a Tesla was rammed from behind.\nZipperstein owns a Cybertruck and has seen people\u2019s frustrations when he\u2019s on the street. \u201cI get the finger like literally once a day, and it\u2019s not because I drive like an idiot,\u201d he said. He hopes people realize that \u201ca car is not a political statement.\u201d [\nChicago Sun-Times\n]\n2.\nCTA slow zones are growing, and that means longer commutes for \u2018L\u2019 riders\n\u00a0\nThe Chicago Tribune reports that slow zones, wherein trains that normally travel up to 55 mph stutter and crawl between 35 and 15 mph, have more than doubled since 2020.\nFive years ago, CTA riders might encounter slow zones over 13% of the rail system, but today that number stands at 30%. All train lines suffer from slow zones, but the Forest Park branch of the Blue Line is particularly burdened, with 77% of its route slowed down. Major portions of the Green Line, the Brown Line and downtown strips of the Red Line also performed poorly.\nThe CTA points to still-diminished ridership and funding since the COVID-19 pandemic, leaving riders still caught between a rock and a slow spot. [\nChicago Tribune\n]\nSPONSOR MESSAGE FROM MODE MOBILE\nThe \u2018Uber\u2019 Disruption of the $500 Billion Smartphone Industry\nNo, it's not Nvidia... It's Mode Mobile, 2023\u2019s fastest-growing software company according to Deloitte.\nJust as Uber turned vehicles into income-generating assets, Mode is \nturning smartphones into an easy passive income source,\n already helping \n45M+\n users earn \n$325M+\n through simple, everyday use.\nThey\u2019ve just been granted their stock ticker by the Nasdaq\n, and you can still \ninvest in their pre-IPO offering at just $0.26/share.\nDisclaimers\n1 Mode Mobile recently received their ticker reservation with Nasdaq ($MODE), indicating an intent to IPO in the next 24 months. An intent to IPO is no guarantee that an actual IPO will occur.\n2 The rankings are based on submitted applications and public company database research, with winners selected based on their fiscal-year revenue growth percentage over a three-year period.\n3 A minimum investment of $1,950 is required to receive bonus shares. 100% bonus shares are offered on investments of $9,950+.\n3.\nRobbery of $30,000 necklace incited the brawl and shootout at O'Hare\n\u00a0\nA $30,000 gold necklace caused a wild shoot-out where nearly 60 shots were fired and a self-proclaimed rapper was wounded last week at O\u2019Hare Airport, according to police reports, writes my colleague Mohammad Samra at the Sun-Times..\nPassengers from a Spirit Airlines flight from Houston made their way down an escalator to baggage claim around 12:55 a.m. Wednesday; one of them, a 27-year-old South Side man, spotted the 25-year-old rapper and followed him.\nThe 27-year-old, carrying a backpack that contained the white gold necklace and $1,000, noticed half a dozen or more males exit a van outside and walk toward the lower level where he was heading, according to a police report and sources.\nOnce downstairs, the 27-year-old was attacked by several masked males and he was hit in the head and chest area after a quarrel, apparently over the backpack. Soon, \u201c[m]ultiple male offenders began to open fire at each other,\u2019\u2019 according to the police report, which showed evidence technicians recovered 57 shell casings. [\nChicago Sun-Times\n]\n4.\nCindy Pritzker, beloved family matriarch and philanthropist, dies at 101\n\u00a0\nMarian \u201cCindy\u201d Friend Pritzker was the matriarch of one of Chicago\u2019s most powerful families. She was the wife of the man behind the Hyatt Hotel dynasty, aunt of Illinois Gov. JB Pritzker and a philanthropist who championed the city\u2019s public libraries and architecture.\nPritzker also liked to have a good time. She enjoyed the occasional glass of wine and cigarette. She held the family record for swearing. At age 80, she got her ears pierced for the first time. A decade later, she got her first tattoo. She headed the Chicago Public Library Board and, with her husband, co-founded the Pritzker Architecture Prize. Andy Warhol even painted her portrait, which now hangs in the Chicago Athletic Association hotel\u2019s rooftop lounge that carries her name.\nPritzker died Saturday, according to a family representative, report my colleagues Kaitlin Washburn and Michael Sneed at the Sun-Times. She was 101 years old. A statement from her family did not disclose how or where she died. [\nChicago Sun-Times\n]\n5.\nPeggy Montes helped establish Chicago's Women's History Month \u2014 and still is a 'lady in motion'\n\u00a0\nIt\u2019s easier for Montes to name the Chicago institutions she does not have a relationship with, whether as a philanthropist, trustee, awardee or founder, reports my Sun-Times colleague Mariah Rush.\nThe Bronzeville native is chairwoman emerita at DuSable Museum, member of the Black Creativity Program at the Griffin Museum of Science and Industry and co-founder of the Leadership Advisory Council at the Art Institute of Chicago, to name a few.\nBeside the arsenal of awards and accomplishments is a woman well aware of her mark on Chicago\u2019s cultural and political history, and she has more goals on her to-do list.\nMontes says she knows why so many social and political powerhouses have sought her help: \u201cI am intelligent, I have wisdom, I\u2019m beautiful and I\u2019m going to do what is right.\u201d [\nChicago Sun-Times\n]\n\u00a0\nHere's what else is happening\n\u00a0\nA new study finds that excessive heat can age you as much as smoking. [\nNPR\n]\nRepublicans in Congress holding town halls and constituent meetings are facing a torrent of confrontational voters scared about possible cuts to Social Security. [\nAP\n]\nIn Little Village, Rodeo Farm is working to restore Illinois prairie with native plants. [\nBlock Club Chicago\n]\nSun-Times reporter Maddie Lee follows the Cubs to Japan for the Tokyo Series against defending World Series champions Los Angeles Dodgers. [\nChicago Sun-Times\n]\n\u00a0\nOh, and one more thing...\n\u00a0\nActor Carrie Coon has appeared in TV series such as \nThe Leftovers, Fargo \nand\n The Gilded Age\n, as well as movies such as \nGone Girl\n. But here in Chicago, she is perhaps best known as an ensemble member of Steppenwolf Theatre, alongside her husband, the actor and writer Tracy Letts.\nCurrently, Coon stars in the third season of Mike White\u2019s award-winning HBO anthology \nThe White Lotus\n. Her character belongs in a trio of middle-aged women who take a girls\u2019 trip to Thailand. While they are ostensibly vacationing, each character\u2019s secrets lurk under an otherwise placid surface. It\u2019s the type of layered, complex character that has attracted Coon throughout her career.\n\u201cWe\u2019re all living in this world where we\u2019re performing self on social media,\u201d she told my colleague Mike Davis. \u201cIt\u2019s absolutely absurd, and everyone\u2019s feeling lonely and everyone\u2019s feeling left out, and everyone\u2019s pretending they\u2019re not. And if you ask any one of these women who is the most judged, left out or lonely, they would each say themselves. It\u2019s just that Laurie happens to be portraying it in the story more thoroughly.\u201d [\nWBEZ\n]\n\u00a0\nTell me something good\n\u00a0\nThe Cubs are in Tokyo and the Music Box Theatre is running a series on \nbaseball films\n. That has me wondering: What\u2019s your favorite sports movie?\nFeel free to email me, and your response may be included in the newsletter this week.\nThanks for reading \u2014 have a great evening!

If you\u2019d like to read it all, please consider \nupgrading your subscription.\nHello friends, \nOne of the things that came up in the SHHARE anti-racism membership community a couple months ago was the question of how to build and sustain anti-racist habits. In other words, while everyone's heart is in the right place, sometimes things slip through the cracks, and people don't feel like they're living up to their values. \nIn response to this, I put together a live learning session on the topic, centred around the productivity practice of habit stacking. In my previous career as a freelance writer, I wrote about habit stacking for \nOnePageCRM\n: \n\u201ctake a few of the small changes you want to make and combine them into a single routine that helps you achieve them. Once you get used to doing the first task, all the others will fall into place as a matter of course.\u201d\nWhy did I think habit stacking was useful for anti-racism? Because small actions, repeated regularly, can add up to lasting change. \nGetting Started With Anti-Racism Habit Stacking\nMany of you will have started with one small action, which might be as simple as following a Black or Global Majority activist or creator and reading, learning from, commenting on or amplifying their work. I'm guessing that's how many of you found me. But imagine the power when you start daisy-chaining multiple actions together, to create daily, weekly and monthly anti-racism habit stacks. \nIn the session, I looked at habits: \nto support an anti-racism mindset \nto create a foundation for learning and taking action \nto spot and deal with racism both in the workplace, and in social and family settings \nfor reflection and self-awareness \nfor going further once you get beyond the initial phase of habit building. \nAnd I shared this sample habit stack for anti-racism: \nDaily:\n Reflective practice morning and evening; amplify a Black creator or activist; identify and learn from a new source and reflect on your learning; add to your list of new sources \nWeekly/Monthly\n: Support a Black-owned business (regular donation or one-off); volunteer in a Black-owned business; advocate for an anti-racism cause; track your progress \nRegularly\n: Accountability check-ins; seek support from the group; speak up; interrupt racism; self-care \nMy Personal Habit Stack\nSince I believe in applying what you learn, the week after the learning session there was another task for the community: to create and share their own starter habit stack. And since I'm part of the community, I created and shared my own. \nSubscribe to SARN Supporter to read the rest.\nBecome a paying subscriber of SARN Supporter to get access to this post and other subscriber-only content. \nUpgrade \nA subscription gets you:\n\u2022 All free benefits (access to the monthly curated reading list, all interviews, and occasional free articles) plus: \n\u2022 Even more anti-racism content (2x a week), plus a monthly behind-the-scenes update \n\u2022 The private SARN podcast, with Sharon's short takes on anti-racism issues (2x per month) \n\u2022 Access to the FULL archive of 500+ posts - no more paywall! \nOther ways to support my work:\nUpgrade to a paid subscription\nMake a donation via \nKo-Fi\n or \nPayPal\nBuy SARN merch\nBuy or gift a copy of \nI\u2019m Tired of Racism\n (don\u2019t forget to leave a review)\nFollow me on LinkedIn\nUpdate your email preferences or unsubscribe \nhere\n\u00a9 2025 Sharon Hurley Hall, Sharon's Anti-Racism Newsletter \n60 Sunrise Drive\nSouthern Heights, Christ Church 17096, Barbados \nPowered by beehiiv\nTerms of Service",

I know it puts more pressure on families to financially engage and we try to avoid it.\u00a0 Regardless, we're gonna open our final fundraiser and try something a little different.\u00a0 Rather than doing the traditional bracket, we are going to do squares. This is very simple, buy your squares and win based on the final score of each game.\u00a0 Remember, there are 67 games when including the play in games.\u00a0 That means you literally have 67 chances to win.\u00a0 With each game fetching a $100 prize, you could win up to $6700.\u00a0 Let's make this the biggest fundraising event yet.\u00a0 Send it out to friends and families.\u00a0 Let's make sure we sell this one out\u00a0 We're going $100 per square.\u00a0 Payment cam be made with Zelle to \nrogs1@mac.com\n.\nLet me know if you have any questions.\nMike",

They were named Billboard\u2019s Top Christian Artist of the 2010 decade, and in 2020 received their eighth American Music Award nomination. A major motion picture based on the life of frontman Bart Millard who wrote the mega-hit song \u201cI Can Only Imagine\u201d after the loss of his father, opened at a remarkable No. 3 at the box office on Mar. 16, 2018 (Lionsgate, Roadside Attractions). Since their debut in 2001, the band has sold more than 9 million units in CD, single and DVD sales, garnered more than 49 No. 1 multi-format radio singles, and had four consecutive mainstream radio hits. MercyMe made history in 2014 as \u201cI Can Only Imagine\u201d surpassed 2 million digital downloads, making it the first song in Christian music to go platinum and double-platinum in the digital domain. The song has now gone 5x platinum. In 2009, Billboard named MercyMe\u2019s \u201cWord Of God Speak\u201d the No. 1 Song of The Decade and the group the No. 1 Artist of the Decade in both the Christian Songs and Christian AC Songs categories, recognizing them as one of the industry\u2019s most notable talents.\u00a0 \nDon't wait!

Push it to friends, family and colleagues.\u00a0 All are welcome to join.\u00a0 67 chances to win.\u00a0\nThank you again\nMike\nOn Mar 14, 2025, at 12:07 AM, Michael Rog <rogs1@mac.com> wrote:\nGood Evening Everyone,\nJust want to say thank you again for the great support shown during the fundraising and the First Pitch Event.\u00a0 We are now reaching the end of the fundraising season as we enter the baseball season.\u00a0 As you are likely aware, there are other groups at DePaul doing March Madness brackets. I know it puts more pressure on families to financially engage and we try to avoid it.\u00a0 Regardless, we're gonna open our final fundraiser and try something a little different.\u00a0 Rather than doing the traditional bracket, we are going to do squares. This is very simple, buy your squares and win based on the final score of each game.\u00a0 Remember, there are 67 games when including the play in games.\u00a0 That means you literally have 67 chances to win.\u00a0 With each game fetching a $100 prize, you could win up to $6700.\u00a0 Let's make this the biggest fundraising event yet.\u00a0 Send it out to friends and families.\u00a0 Let's make sure we sell this one out\u00a0 We're going $100 per square.\u00a0 Payment cam be made with Zelle to \nrogs1@mac.com\n.\nLet me know if you have any questions.\nMike",

    "body": "Plus, this year\u2019s viral St. Patrick\u2019s Day stunt. Here\u2019s what you need to know today.\n \n.\nTo view this email as a web page, click \nhere.\nFriday - March 14, 2025\nToday's \nRundown\n is brought to you by WBEZ members\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\nby Esther Bergdahl\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\nGood afternoon! Warmer temperatures have arrived, but so has the potential for \nmajor storms\n this weekend. As for the rest of the news, here\u2019s what you need to know today.\n\u00a0 \n1.\nSlim odds of an arrest when someone is shot and wounded in Chicago\n\u00a0\nMore than 19,000 people have been wounded by gunfire in the city since 2018, but the chance of anyone being charged with the shooting is about 6%. Last year alone, there were 2,300 nonfatal shootings and police made arrests in just 141 of them, my colleagues Andy Grimm and Tom Schuba report for the Sun-Times.\nLaw enforcement has also expressed deep frustration with the process. \u201cEven if you wanted to run down every case like [it was] a murder, there\u2019s just no time to do it,\u201d one retired detective said. \u201cAnd you\u2019re not going to get approved for any overtime unless it\u2019s a case that\u2019s been in the news.\u201d [\nChicago Sun-Times\n]\nCynthia Green lost two sons to gun violence. A third was left paralyzed. She thinks she knows when detectives are doing their jobs. \u201cI do think it makes a difference who you are or who they think you are and if they think it is worth it,\u201d she says. \u201cAnd that\u2019s not how it should be.\u201d [\nChicago Sun-Times\n]\n2.\nImmigration agents arrested a U.S. citizen and created warrants after an arrest, lawyers say in court\n\u00a0\nChicago attorneys with the National Immigrant Justice Center and the ACLU of Illinois have accused the federal government of violating immigration law and the constitutional rights of at least 22 people who were arrested and detained in the Midwest as part of President Donald Trump\u2019s crackdown on immigration. Two people are still in custody, 19 were released on bond and one has already been deported, the lawyers said.\nAttorneys are asking for the immediate release of people still detained, bond reimbursements, weekly reports on immigration arrests, and additional training and discipline of federal agents involved in the arrests, my colleague Adriana Cardona-Maguigad writes at the Sun-Times.\nThese actions may violate the Nava Settlement, a 2018 class-action lawsuit filed in response to unlawful arrests by ICE agents who used traffic stops and other tactics to make arrests without a warrant. Under the agreement, ICE officials can conduct a warrantless arrest if they believe an individual is likely to escape, but they must provide evidence.\n\u201cNo one disputes that ICE has authority to do immigration enforcement in the U.S., in Chicago, anywhere in the U.S.,\u201d said Mark Fleming of the National Immigrant Justice Center\u2019s federal litigation project. \u201cBut they only have authority to do it under the laws that Congress have passed or are part of the legal limitations of the U.S. Constitution.\u201d [\nChicago Sun-Times\n]\nMEMBERS FUND WBEZ CHICAGO\nExperience some of Chicago's best dining!\nWant to go on a tasting adventure of Chicago\u2019s culinary gems across Hyde Park, The Loop, Lincoln Park, Logan Square and Pilsen? When you \nsupport WBEZ\n, you can win a $500 dining package\u00a0to \nVirtue\n, \nThe Berghoff\n, \nMedi\n, \nLardon\n, and \nHaiSous\n! Donate TONIGHT by 7 p.m. for your chance to \nexperience our city\u2019s rich culinary scene while supporting independent journalism\n.\n3.\nTrump takes aim at Chicago again \u2014 this time with a federal task force on antisemitism\n\u00a0\nA new Federal Task Force to Combat Antisemitism, led by U.S. Attorney General Pam Bondi, notified Mayor Brandon Johnson and his counterparts in New York, Boston and Los Angeles yesterday that it wanted to meet soon to discuss their responses to incidents of antisemitism over the last two years, my colleagues Fran Spielman and Tina Sfondeles report. A representative for Gov. J.B. Pritzker called out a pattern of obsession with Illinois in general and Chicago in particular by the Trump administration.\n\u201cIf the Department of Justice was actually interested in combating antisemitism, they would expand their scope beyond just a politicized effort in a few select blue cities and states,\u201d spokesman Alex Gough said. \u201cProtesting, even if it\u2019s something you disagree with, is a critical part of the protections under the First Amendment and in no instance should we allow the federal government to infringe upon that right.\u201d [\nChicago Sun-Times\n]\nMore than 50 universities are currently under federal investigation for alleged racial discrimination, including against white and Asian students, as part of the Trump administration\u2019s campaign against diversity, equity and inclusion efforts. [\nAP\n]\n4.\nSome CTA buses to start giving out tickets for blocking bike and bus lanes\n\u00a0\nTransit and biking advocates had long spoken out in favor of designated lanes to share city streets with cars, while decrying drivers\u2019 intrusions in those lanes. This summer, the Chicago Transit Authority plans to deploy ticket-writing cameras on some of its buses as part of the city\u2019s bike and bus lane enforcement pilot, writes my Sun-Times colleague David Struett.\nThe CTA board this week approved a $315,852 contract with Hayden AI for the cameras and technology. The city\u2019s Transportation Department has said the cameras will be fixed to buses using Dearborn, Madison and Washington streets and Chicago Avenue. Cameras added to six CTA buses will begin issuing warnings and tickets in July or August, according to a CTA spokesperson. The exact date will be determined after a 60-day testing period begins in May or June.\nThe potential violations include $90 fines for parking in a bus lane, $250 fines for bike path obstructions, $50 tickets for parking in expired meters outside of the central business district and $140 tickets for personal vehicles parked in commercial loading zones. [\nChicago Sun-Times\n]\n5.\nChicago pubs prep for St. Patrick\u2019s Day \u2018splitting the G\u2019 TikTok trend\n\u00a0\nGuinness, the centuries-old malted barley stout synonymous with Irish pub culture, may not have the edge of other viral beverages, but this St. Patrick\u2019s Day is the beer\u2019s time to shine on social media. Drinkers dedicated to \u201csplitting the G\u201d film themselves attempting to swig enough on their first chug to line up the foam with the middle of the \u201cG\u201d on a Guinness-branded glass, writes my colleague Katie Anthony at the Sun-Times.\nChris Wise, 27, has made it his mission to \u201csplit the G\u201d at every bar in Chicago \u2014 and has chronicled his attempts on TikTok. \u201cWhat works for me, when it works, is three big gulps,\u201d he said. \u201cYou gotta go in the mindset of, \u2018I\u2019m gonna get it.\u201d\nIn Avondale, at a pub which boasts a \u201cBest Pint in America\u201d award, Chief O\u2019Neill\u2019s bar manager Anluan McKinney said they expect to go through 50 or more kegs of Guinness on parade day alone. [\nChicago Sun-Times\n]\n\u00a0\nHere's what else is happening\n\u00a0\nSenate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer drew fire from fellow Democrats after supporting a Republican budget plan that averts a partial government shutdown. [\nABC News\n]\nHamas indicated willingness to release five American hostages after 524 days, including 21-year-old New Jersey native Edan Alexander and four who have been killed in Gaza. [\nTimes of Israel\n]\nWhen the Chicago River is dyed green tomorrow to celebrate St. Patrick\u2019s Day, scientists will be ready to study how it affects wildlife in and near the water. [\nChicago Tribune\n]\nThe beavers spotted along the Chicago River finally have names, after a round of voting: mom Ida Beav Wells and kits Chewy Garcia and Plumpton Sinclair. [\nBlock Club Chicago\n]\n\u00a0\nOh, and one more thing...\n\u00a0\nOrganizers have revived a citywide celebration of composer J.S. Bach, starting with a daylong festival and a Union Station pop-up.\nThe first Bach in the City concert, \u201cBach and the Venetians,\u201d happens March 21 at St. Vincent de Paul in Lincoln Park. The organizers hope that event \u2014 and an earlier performance that day at Union Station for commuters \u2014 will spur Bach events that dot Chicago\u2019s music scene throughout the year and the city.\n\u201cI\u2019m 72, and I am on fire for this as much as I was when I was 21,\u201d said organist and conductor Richard Webster, the music director of 98% of Bach Weeks, the previous incarnation of the fest which ran for five decades. \u201cI need this musical outlet. I don\u2019t want to shrivel up. I love what I do, and I still have a passion and energy for it.\u201d [\nWBEZ\n]\n\u00a0\nTell me something good\n\u00a0\nChicago expects temperatures exceeding 70 degrees by the end of the week. How are you planning to embrace milder climes and more hours of daylight?\nAnn writes:\n\u201cMy garden is enjoying the warmth. Snowdrops have quickly popped up and bloomed, both in the garden and in the lawn. The small early crocuses are up and forming buds. I\u2019m looking forward to glory of the snow, scillas, and early daffodils.\u201d\nSandra writes:\n\u201cHow will I embrace the spring thaw? Finally getting out of hibernation mode; going for walks by the lake and taking my new electric bike out for some joy rides!\u201d \nThanks for reading \u2014 have a wonderful weekend! I'll see you on Monday.

    "body": "Good Evening Everyone,\nJust want to say thank you again for the great support shown during the fundraising and the First Pitch Event.\u00a0 We are now reaching the end of the fundraising season as we enter the baseball season.\u00a0 As you are likely aware, there are other groups at DePaul doing March Madness brackets. I know it puts more pressure on families to financially engage and we try to avoid it.\u00a0 Regardless, we're gonna open our final fundraiser and try something a little different.\u00a0 Rather than doing the traditional bracket, we are going to do squares. This is very simple, buy your squares and win based on the final score of each game.\u00a0 Remember, there are 67 games when including the play in games.\u00a0 That means you literally have 67 chances to win.\u00a0 With each game fetching a $100 prize, you could win up to $6700.\u00a0 Let's make this the biggest fundraising event yet.\u00a0 Send it out to friends and families.\u00a0 Let's make sure we sell this one out\u00a0 We're going $100 per square.\u00a0 Payment cam be made with Zelle to \nrogs1@mac.com\n.\nLet me know if you have any questions.\nMike",

Here\u2019s what you need to know today.\n \n.\nTo view this email as a web page, click \nhere.\nThursday - March 13, 2025\nToday's \nRundown\n is brought to you by WBEZ members and\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\nby Esther Bergdahl\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\nGood afternoon! Although I'm not a queen, I want to wish everyone a \nhappy Purim\n, which starts tonight. As for the rest of the news, here\u2019s what you need to know today.\u00a0\n\u00a0 \nRELAX & RECHARGE:\u00a0\nYour support of WBEZ could win you a luxury spa day.\u00a0\nDONATE\n1.\nTrump slashes environmental programs in Chicago that protect poor communities\n\u00a0\nEnvironmental justice, \nborn in Chicago\n decades ago, recognizes how poorer communities often experience more air, water and ground pollution than more affluent areas. Environmental justice programs at the Environmental Protection Agency have since zeroed in on drinking water protections, as well as hazardous waste and other problems.\nHowever, President Donald Trump this week ordered closures of EPA offices that help low-income communities overwhelmed with pollution, writes my colleague Brett Chase at the Sun-Times. It\u2019s unclear how many positions will be cut in Chicago, but union officials estimate it may affect 20 to 30 of the roughly 1,000 EPA regional employees.\nThe order was one of dozens aimed at rescinding health and environmental protections. Related actions this week included a rollback of air pollution safeguards for coal-fired power plants, a planned review of fine-particle pollution rules begun under former President Joe Biden and elimination of requirements aimed at curbing global warming. [\nChicago Sun-Times\n]\nYesterday, EPA Administrator Lee Zeldin announced plans to target more than two dozen rules and policies in what the agency called the \u201cmost consequential day of deregulation in U.S. history.\u201d Zeldin lauded his agency\u2019s upcoming moves as a \u201cdagger straight into the heart of the climate change religion.\u201d [\nNPR\n]\n2.\nIllinois eyes taxing drivers by the mile \u2014 rather than by the gallon of gas\n\u00a0\nIllinoisans pay the second-highest motor fuel tax in the country after California. That tax helps pay for road, bridge and public transit improvements throughout the state. These days, reports my Sun-Times colleague George Wiebe, vehicles require less gas \u2014 or no gas at all \u2014 so funding for infrastructure has taken a hit.\n\u201cIf you were to say to someone with an electric vehicle, \u2018Do you think you should pay to maintain the roads and bridges that you\u2019re driving on?\u2019 I think most people would say yes,\u201d said Marc Poulos, executive director of Operating Engineers Local 150, which strongly supports the proposed legislation.\nWith a mileage-based system, drivers could expect to pay three to four cents per mile. That would come on top of any tolls already being paid, similar to the gas tax. Oregon and Utah have already implemented similar programs, and five states including Pennsylvania and California have begun pilot or exploratory efforts, according to the National Conference of State Legislatures. [\nChicago Sun-Times\n]\nSPONSOR MESSAGE FROM GRIFFIN MUSEUM OF SCIENCE AND INDUSTRY\nThe Black Creativity Juried Art Exhibition\nFor 50 years, the Griffin Museum of Science and Industry has hosted the nation's premier exhibition of African American art. The Black Creativity Juried Art Exhibition features over 100 works from professional and emerging Black artists from across the U.S., highlighting African American achievement in art, science, and technology. Now open through April 27. For more details, visit \nMSIChicago.org.\n3.\nNorthwestern faculty and students say efforts to appease Trump chill free speech\n\u00a0\nConcerned students and faculty say they understand the threats the Trump administration is putting on the Evanston school, but they tell my colleague Lisa Kurian Philip that a new anti-bias training includes commentary characterizing criticism of Israel as antisemitic.\nIn one of the most contentious parts of the video, which students are required to watch, the presenter suggests comments made by critics of Israel are as problematic as those made by David Duke, the infamous leader of the Ku Klux Klan.\nNorthwestern is the target of multiple federal investigations. Federal officials say the university has failed to protect Jewish students. The stakes were magnified late last week when the White House announced $400 million in cuts to Columbia University over similar allegations. University spokesperson Jon Yates said the new antisemitism training video was meant to help the campus community understand how it feels for Jewish students to hear certain words and experience certain actions.\n\u201cI look at these trainings not as an end point, but I hope that they'll be a starting point to enabling \u2026 a more broad and a more thoughtful conversation about these issues in all quarters of the university,\u201d said Michael Simon, who directs the Jewish campus organization Hillel. [\nWBEZ\n]\n4.\nSouth Side pastor takes action on \u2018egg crisis\u2019 by giving away 40,000 eggs\n\u00a0\nAs\u00a0\negg prices soar\n due to bird flu, many Chicagoans have had trouble finding eggs at grocery stores or are not able to afford eggs at current prices \u2014 which are nearly 60% more expensive than last year. The U.S. Department of Agriculture expects egg prices to rise 41% this year over last year\u2019s average of $3.17 per dozen.\nThe Rev. Charlie Dates, head pastor at Progressive Baptist Church in Bridgeport and Salem Baptist Church in Pullman, organized both churches to buy eggs from wholesale distributor Sysco. On Saturday, volunteers will distribute eggs at locations across the South Side between noon and 2 p.m. Each person who shows up will receive a carton of eggs, and Dates said he hopes to have enough eggs to pass out to nearly 3,000 families.\n\u201cWe have a unique opportunity to do what the church has always done, and that is to care for marginalized people,\u201d he told my Sun-Times colleague Cindy Hernandez. \u201cSo, we\u2019re not going to wait for [President Trump] to fix it.\u201d [\nChicago Sun-Times\n]\n5.\nInside the fossil hunt: Digging for the monsters of Illinois\u2019 Mazon Creek\n\u00a0\nField Museum \u201csuper volunteer\u201d Jack Wittry has done as much as anyone to link the Field\u2019s distinguished scientists with a colorful group of characters: earnest fossil nerds, buyers and sellers, suspicious hoarders, wealthy dilettantes and scrappy collectors who test the outer bounds of legality.\nWBEZ contributor Zachary Nauth introduces us to some of them, searching for the love of the chase, for science, for money and for reasons unknown. Their work has made the Field\u2019s collection of 123 plant species and 330 animal species from Mazon Creek, about 80 miles southwest of Chicago, world-famous.\nWittry\u2019s biggest score for the Field was the largest collection of high-quality Mazon Creek fossils in the world, held by Thomas Testa, who lived in nearby Carbon Hill. It had been appraised at close to $100,000, Wittry said, but the Field could never persuade a conspiratorial Testa to donate his haul.\nThen, out of the blue in 2015, Wittry got a text message: \u201cYou\u2019ve got 24 hours to come get them.\u201d [\nWBEZ\n]\n\u00a0\nHere's what else is happening\n\u00a0\nA mechanical titanium heart kept one Australian man alive for more than 100 days while he waited on a transplant, a breakthrough stopgap against donor shortages. [\nCNN\n]\nThanks primarily to immigration, the Chicago-Naperville-Elgin metropolitan area grew by nearly 71,000 people last year. [\nChicago Tribune\n]\nThe oldest face in Western Europe belongs to a human ancestor found in Spain, where it lived more than 1 million years ago. [\nThe Guardian\n]\nThe Oasis reunion tour, scheduled to launch this summer, will be turned into a film by the creator of \nPeaky Blinders\n. [\nVariety\n]\n\u00a0\nOh, and one more thing...\n\u00a0\nFor a certain kind of kid, memorizing as many decimal points of the mathematical constant pi is a titanic feat. However soon you trail off after 3.14, as my Sun-Times colleague Rafaela Jinich reminds us, the world\u2019s favorite irrational number has inspired celebrations since Pi Day became a thing in 1988.\nThe first celebration took place in San Francisco at 1:59 p.m., featuring fruit pies and a tea urn set up by physicist Larry Shaw and his wife. Over the years, the event grew to include a \u201cPi Shrine,\u201d a circular parade and a ritual of walking around the shrine 3.14 times while singing \u201cHappy Birthday\u201d to Albert Einstein \u2014 whose birthday also falls on March 14. Even the U.S. House of Representatives got in on the action, formally recognizing Pi Day in 2009.\nWhether you\u2019re in it for the math or just the munchies, some of Chicago\u2019s restaurants and bakeries will serve up \u03c0-inspired deals on Friday, March 14. But since Pi Day is essentially the Super Bowl for pie businesses, some skip the discounts and instead roll out more flavors, knowing demand will be high.

    "body": "You don't want to miss this.\n\u200a\n \nGreetings.\u00a0As I have recently returned from a month teaching in our MBA program in Bahrain, I had some time for reflection while I was between class sessions.\u00a0This trip was a tremendous experience for me as I was pushed outside my comfort zone traveling to the Persian Gulf for the first time.\u00a0Once there, I realized how friendly everyone was and it was so great to discover our similarities and respect our differences.\u00a0One common theme was our discussion about discovering what you are passionate about in your career and in starting a business.\u00a0Almost every entrepreneur we profile from Branson to Oprah to Jobs talk about how important passion is to being successful in business and in life! When you spend time doing what you love, what you\u2019re uniquely gifted to do, all sense of time disappears. The old saying is to find a job you love and you will never work another day in your life.\u00a0Now I realize that many of our graduating seniors have to \u201cpay their dues\u201d for a while to cover their expenses and get started in their career.\u00a0We all had jobs that we did not really like, but the key is to keep an eye on what you are really passionate about.\u00a0It is about finding your WHY in your career. Simon Sinek has a great Ted Talk on the Power of Why that defines us.\u00a0The caution is that when you find a job you are good at, you might get comfortable and keep doing it to pay the bills, but it does not really fulfill your passion.\u00a0People hesitate pursuing their true passion because it represents change, what am I giving up.\u00a0Fear of the unknown, sadness of letting go and change can be scary. Is it better to just stay comfortable and be miserable? One thing to think about is if you only had 5 years to live, what really matters and how could you move toward your true passion.\u00a0We wish you all a great journey to find your true passion!\nCEC Executive Director\nBruce Leech\n\u200a\n \nNews Stories & Highlights \n\u200a\n \nEFBC Webinar With George Karavattuveetil \nOn February 11th, students had the opportunity to engage in an exclusive discussion on\u00a0career ownership and personal growth, hosted by the\u00a0Entrepreneur & Family Business Council and the Coleman Entrepreneurship Center. This event featured\u00a0George Karavattuveetil, President and Founder of\u00a0Psyched, who shared invaluable insights on how to take control of what is yours.\nThroughout the discussion, George guided attendees through key strategies to help them\u00a0identify their goals, build self-discipline, cultivate confidence, and effectively communicate their needs. He emphasized the importance of\u00a0leveraging personal strengths and taking intentional steps toward career success.\nStudents left the event feeling empowered and equipped with practical tools to\u00a0seize new opportunities and navigate their professional journeys with confidence. This discussion served as a reminder that success starts with self-awareness, discipline, and the courage to take action.\nA huge thank you to\u00a0EFBC, and George Karavattuveetil\u00a0for making this event possible! Stay tuned for the EFBC: Women Trailblazers Webinar on March 20th!\n \nWomens Month Spotlight - Mariel Mudrik \nAt the\u00a0Coleman Entrepreneurship Center,\u00a0we love seeing student entrepreneurs thrive, and\u00a0Mariel Mudrik, co-founder of\u00a0DePhi Media, is no exception. As a frequent user of CEC resources, Mariel has embraced every opportunity to grow her business while balancing the challenges of being a student entrepreneur.\nDePhi Media, a video production company that\u00a0\u201cdares to be different,\u201d\u00a0specializes in infusing projects with\u00a0experimental storytelling and editing techniques, breaking away from the industry norm. \nMariel and her team started DePhi after recognizing\n how difficult it was for businesses to market their products effectively. By helping business owners feel seen, DePhi creates content that leaves a tangible impact. \u201cThe most rewarding part is reading reviews and seeing real change in the businesses we work with,\u201d Mariel shares. However,\u00a0time management\u00a0has been one of the biggest challenges, juggling work, business operations, class, homework, and other commitments. Luckily, having a strong co-founder has helped her balance the workload.\nMariel recently competed in the\u00a0Big East Pitch Competition, an experience that reinforced a key lesson:\u00a0\"Entrepreneurship is a hard journey, but you don\u2019t have to do it alone.\" The competition exposed her to a larger network of people willing to help, emphasizing the importance of\u00a0seeking out resources and connections. At the\u00a0CEC, she\u2019s taken full advantage of networking events, and workshops, which helped her build DePhi\u2019s identity and visibility. \u201cThe Coleman Center provides opportunities for everyone, you get as much out of it as you put in,\u201d she says.\nAs DePhi grows, Mariel envisions future collaborations with Chicago-based artists and brands, such as working with local musicians on visually compelling music videos or partnering with Chicago-based businesses and creative studios for commercial projects. She\u2019s also focused on\u00a0expanding DePhi\u2019s social media presence and eventually\u00a0building out a studio.\n\ufeff\nTo connect with Mariel and learn more about DePhi, visit \ndephimedia.com\n, \nreach out via\u00a0\nLinkedIn\n, or email her at\u00a0\nmariel@dephimedia.com\n.\n \n \n \nMeet Mia Thomas, Our New Student Assistant!\nWe\u2019re thrilled to welcome Mia Thomas to the Coleman Entrepreneurship Center as our newest student assistant!

By 2021, remote work participation had surged, especially in professional, scientific, and technical services, as well as information and finance industries. The rise in remote work contributed positively to Total Factor Productivity (TFP) growth across 61 private-sector industries, particularly through reduced nonlabor costs, such as office space expenses.\nFrom 2019 to 2022, the increase in remote work was linked to a 1.1 percentage-point rise in industry-level productivity, with companies benefiting from lower turnover and operational efficiencies. However, productivity gains were not passed to employees through higher compensation. Instead, workers reaped indirect benefits, such as reduced commuting time and expenses. Despite these advantages, industries varied in their ability to balance output and labor input. For most high-productivity sectors, output growth outpaced labor input increases, indicating efficient use of remote work.\nDr. Gleb\u2019s Take\nThis study confirms that remote work isn\u2019t just a convenience\u2014it\u2019s a powerful driver of productivity and cost-efficiency. Businesses that adapt to remote or hybrid models are gaining a competitive edge, leveraging reduced office space and operational costs while enhancing employee retention.\nHowever, the failure to share these productivity gains with employees reflects shortsighted leadership. Workers saved time and money on commuting, but organizations missed an opportunity to strengthen loyalty by sharing financial benefits to support workers being more productive and comfortable in their home offices. I always advise my clients to invest into employee home offices, such as good tech, ergonomic furniture, and fast internet, which is a win-win for employees and companies alike.\u00a0\nThe data is clear: remote work is not a temporary pandemic solution but a sustainable model for the future of work. Leaders who embrace and optimize this shift will outperform competitors who cling to outdated, office-centric paradigms.\n\u201c\nBaby boomers say they don\u2019t need to retire now that they can work from home\u2014and they\u2019ve got side hustles on top of their 9-to-5\u2019s\n\u201d (Fortune)\nSummary\nRemote and hybrid work have reshaped retirement plans for baby boomers, allowing them to extend their careers while enjoying better work-life balance. A survey by Smart Energy GB found that nearly 70% of those over 60 are working in hybrid roles, while others work remotely full-time. Without the stress of commuting, many baby boomers are energized to take on side hustles, with tutoring being the most popular choice.\nThe flexibility of remote work has enabled 25% of surveyed boomers to explore new hobbies they had planned for retirement, such as gardening, yoga, and walking. This dual approach to career and leisure has left 66% feeling less stressed, 94% reporting a renewed zest for life, and 90% expressing satisfaction with their careers.\nGlobally, the trend of \u201cunretiring\u201d is growing. In the U.K., 14% of baby boomers and late Gen Xers have returned to work, with an additional 4% considering it. In the U.S., the share of workers aged 65 and older has nearly doubled since the 1980s, with 20% of that age group now employed. Many older workers cite financial concerns as a key reason for staying in or returning to the workforce.\nDr. Gleb\u2019s Take\nThis is a striking testament to the transformative power of remote work. Baby boomers have cracked the code to achieving both financial security and personal fulfillment in their later years. By eliminating the daily grind of commuting, remote work has given them the flexibility to maintain their income while pursuing hobbies and even side gigs.\nEmployers should take note: offering hybrid or fully remote roles is not just a perk\u2014it\u2019s a retention strategy for experienced, highly skilled workers. Boomers bring decades of expertise, and their willingness to stay in the workforce longer is a massive asset to businesses willing to adapt to their needs.\nThe \"unretiring\" trend also highlights a cultural shift. Work is no longer seen as a binary choice between career and retirement. Instead, flexible models enable older workers to blend income, passion projects, and personal growth. Companies that fail to embrace this model risk losing out on a wealth of institutional knowledge and leadership from seasoned a multigenerational workforce.\u00a0\n\"\nMatt Yglesias Considered As The Nietzschean Superman\n\" (Astral Codex Ten)\nSummary\nThis piece explores Nietzsche's concepts of \"master morality\" and \"slave morality,\" contrasting their historical roots and societal impacts. Master morality celebrates strength, achievement, and individual excellence, while slave morality emphasizes humility, equality, and harm reduction. The article critiques both frameworks, noting that slave morality often manifests as an obsession with diminishing oneself or others to avoid judgment, while master morality can devolve into arrogance and disregard for communal well-being.\nThrough diverse examples\u2014from Puritans and Soviet propaganda to Ayn Rand and modern liberalism\u2014the essay navigates attempts to reconcile these moralities. Figures like Ayn Rand and Richard Hanania represent different approaches to integrating Nietzschean ideas into modern frameworks. The author concludes by endorsing a \"spiral of values,\" where altruism and ambition coexist in a dynamic balance to glorify civilization and improve human happiness.\nDr. Gleb\u2019s Take\nThis essay is a masterful exploration of moral frameworks, and gets at a key point: the dichotomy of master and slave morality is too simplistic for the complexity of modern life. Both approaches contain dangerous extremes\u2014unchecked master morality fosters exploitation and harm, while uncritical slave morality stifles innovation and achievement.\nThe path forward isn\u2019t in choosing one over the other or crafting tenuous compromises like \u201cliberal democracy.\u201d It\u2019s in embracing \nadaptive morality\n: a system where individuals and societies balance personal excellence with collective good. This means rewarding ambition when it uplifts others and challenging humility when it becomes performative or self-defeating.\nNietzsche\u2019s Superman isn\u2019t a literal figure\u2014it\u2019s a call to evolve past outdated binaries. We need a vision that values strength as a tool for service and humility as a path to growth. That\u2019s how you build a world where ambition thrives without crushing the vulnerable.\nWhat did you think of my take on these articles?

If you\u2019re still relying on the same media tactics from years ago, you\u2019re leaving revenue on the table.\nThat\u2019s why I created the \nMake Media Work Again\n program. It\u2019s not just another marketing gimmick\u2014it\u2019s a real strategy shift that combines AI-driven media buying with high-value content to engage, educate, and convert your ideal customers.\nI\u2019m Paul Mosenson, founder of \nNuSpark Media Group\n, and for over 30 years, I\u2019ve helped B2C brands scale smarter\u2014without wasting ad spend. Now, AI allows us to pinpoint buyers, personalize engagement, and turn cold traffic into real relationships.\nThis approach is easy to test, requires an open mind, and delivers measurable results fast. If you\u2019re ready to see better leads and higher conversions, let\u2019s chat.\n\ud83d\udcc5 Book a quick call here\n:\n \nhttps://calendly.com/pmosenson/30min\nLet\u2019s make your media work again.\n\u2014Paul\nPaul Mosenson\nFounder, Marketing Consultant, AI Lead Generator, Media Director\nNuSpark Media Group\nOffice: 610-604-0639\nMobile: 610-812-2725\nSchedule a call\n with me with Calendly\nP.S.\n Even if you have a strong marketing team, I\u2019m happy to collaborate. \nWe\u2019re stronger together\n, and my approach can complement what you\u2019re already doing\u2014bringing fresh insights, AI-driven strategies, and a results-focused mindset.

Despite this growth, these businesses still encounter challenges in accessing government contracting opportunities. Fortunately, two key programs can help level the playing field: the 8(a) Business Development Program and the GSA Schedule.\nThe 8(a) Certification: Expanding Opportunities for Women-Owned Businesses\nThe 8(a) program provides a crucial pathway for socially and economically disadvantaged businesses, including women-owned businesses, to secure federal contracts. While many assume this program is limited to minority-owned businesses, the reality is that Caucasian women-owned businesses can also qualify if they meet the eligibility requirements.\nEligibility Criteria for 8(a) Certification:\n*Must be a small business\n*Must not have previously participated in the 8(a) program\n*Must be at least 51% owned and controlled by U.S. citizens who are socially and economically disadvantaged\n*Must meet specific financial criteria:\nPersonal net worth of $850 thousand or less\nAdjusted gross income of $400 thousand or less\nTotal assets valued at $6.5 million or less\n*Must demonstrate good character and have been in business for at least two years\n*Must submit a social disadvantage narrative that provides documented evidence of discrimination or bias that has impacted business growth\nMany Caucasian women-owned businesses mistakenly believe they are ineligible, but the SBA's 'preponderance of evidence' standard has made it easier for qualified applicants to gain certification. If you meet these criteria, the 8(a) program can provide invaluable access to government contracting opportunities.\nThe GSA Schedule: A Key Advantage for WOSBs\nThe GSA Schedule is another powerful tool for WOSBs seeking to expand their footprint in the federal marketplace. By obtaining a GSA Schedule Contract, women-owned businesses gain direct access to government buyers and streamlined contracting opportunities.\nGSA has been instrumental in supporting WOSBs, working to remove barriers and promote greater access to federal procurement opportunities. The federal government has long set a goal of awarding at least 5% of federal contracting dollars to WOSBs, particularly in industries where they are underrepresented.\nWhy the GSA Schedule is Beneficial for WOSBs:\nProvides a streamlined process for federal contracting\nEnhances credibility and visibility with government buyers\nHelps businesses compete more effectively for federal contracts\nOffers long-term revenue potential through repeat business with government agencies\nFor the 14th consecutive year, GSA has earned an 'A+' rating from the SBA on its Small Business Procurement Scorecard, demonstrating its commitment to fostering the growth of small and disadvantaged businesses.\nHow 8(a) Certification and GSA Schedules Work Together\nWomen-owned businesses that obtain both 8(a) certification and a GSA Schedule gain a significant competitive advantage. The 8(a) certification allows businesses to pursue set-aside contracts, while the GSA Schedule makes the procurement process more efficient, increasing accessibility to federal agencies.\nTake the Next Step Toward Federal Contracting Success\nIf you're a woman-owned business looking to maximize your federal contracting potential, now is the time to act!\nExplore your eligibility for 8(a) certification and leverage the benefits it offers.\nGet a GSA Schedule Contract to streamline your access to federal buyers.\nPartner with experts who can guide you through the certification and procurement process.\nDon't miss out on these valuable opportunities.

Miles will be credited to your account 8-12 weeks after you reach the Threshold Amount. Bonus Miles may appear on your account in more than one deposit. To receive the 110,000 bonus miles, your Card account must not be canceled or past due at the time of fulfillment. Eligible purchases can be made by the Basic Card Member and any Additional Card Members on a single Card account. Eligible purchases are purchases for goods and services minus returns and other credits. Eligible purchases to meet the spend requirement do NOT include fees or interest charges, cash advances, purchases of traveler's checks, purchases or reloading of prepaid cards, purchases of gift cards, person-to-person payments, or purchases of any cash equivalents. Additional Card Members on your account are not eligible for their own offer. In rare instances, your period to spend $12,000 may be shorter than 6 months if there is a delay in receiving your Card. Also, purchases may fall outside of the 6 month period in some cases, such as a delay in merchants submitting transactions to us or if the purchase date differs from the date you made the transaction. (For example, if you buy goods online, the purchase date may be the date the goods are shipped). This offer is not transferable. If your application is not received by 04/02/2025, we will not process your application even if we later receive your application. American Express reserves the right to modify or revoke offer at any time. \u00a0\u200b\nIf you have a history of cancelling or downgrading American Express Card accounts within your first year and you cancel or downgrade your new Card account within your first year, we may not credit, we may freeze, or we may take away the bonus miles from your account. If we determine that you have engaged in abuse, misuse, or gaming in connection with this offer in any way or that you intend to do so, including if you return purchases you made to meet the Threshold Amount, we may not credit, we may freeze, or we may take away the bonus miles from your account. We may also cancel any accounts you have with us.\u200b\n2.\n\u00a0\nEmployee Card\nIn order to use the Employee Card to make\u00a0purchases, you or your employee will need to provide the employee\u2019s Residential Address,\u00a0Social Security Number, and Date of Birth when confirming the\u00a0Employee Card. If this information is not provided within 60 days of Card\u00a0issuance, your Employee Card will be canceled.\n3.\n\u00a0\nMiles on Eligible Purchases\n1x Mile on eligible purchases:\n\u00a0Basic Card Members will earn 1 mile for each dollar of eligible purchases charged on their Card or any Additional Cards on the Card Account.\n1.5x Miles on U.S. Shipping:\n\u00a0Basic Card Members will earn 0.5 additional miles (for a total of 1.5 miles) for each dollar of eligible purchases on their Card or any Additional Cards on the Card Account charged at merchants in the U.S. for shipping services. To earn additional miles for shipping, eligible purchases must be made at courier, postal, and freight shippers located in the U.S. Basic Card Members will not earn additional miles for shipping costs added to retail purchases or moving services.\n\u00a0\n1.5x Miles on Transit:\n\u00a0Basic Card Members will earn 0.5 additional miles (for a total of 1.5 miles) for each dollar of eligible transit purchases on their Card or any Additional Cards on the Card Account. Eligible transit purchases include purchases with train, taxicab, ride share service, ferry, toll, parking, bus, and subway merchants. Purchases of airfare, car rental and cruises are not considered eligible transit purchases.\n\u00a0\n1.5x Miles at U.S. Office Supply Stores:\n Basic Card Members will earn 0.5 additional miles (for a total of 1.5 miles) for each dollar of eligible purchases on their Card or any Additional Cards on the Card Account at office supply stores located in the U.S. Office supply stores are in the business of selling a range of office supplies, including items like: paper, notebooks, office equipment, and office furniture. Office supplies purchased at other retail stores will not earn additional miles.\n\u00a0\n1.5x Miles on purchases after spending $150,000:\n\u00a0If in any calendar year eligible purchases made on the Delta SkyMiles\n\u00ae \nReserve Business Card total more than $150,000, Basic Card Members will earn 0.5 additional miles (for a total of 1.5 miles) on eligible purchases on their Card or any Additional Cards on the Card Account made after the $150,000 threshold is reached through the end of the same calendar year. Only one accelerator will apply even if a purchase qualifies for multiple mileage categories. If an eligible purchase qualifies for a category that has a higher mileage accelerator, only the higher accelerator will apply instead of the one-half mile per dollar. For example, if you make a Delta purchase after reaching the $150,000 threshold, the Basic Card Member will earn two additional miles per dollar instead of an additional one-half mile per dollar for that Delta purchase. The close of the calendar year is December 31st without regard to the time of the year that the account is opened. This means that for the first year of Card Membership, the Card Account\u2019s time period to reach the $150,000 threshold may be less than twelve months.\n3x Miles on Delta Purchases:\n\u00a0Basic Card Members will earn 2 additional miles (for a total of 3 miles) on each dollar of eligible purchases on their Card or any Additional Cards on the Card Account charged directly with Delta where Delta is the merchant of record, such as purchases via\u00a0\ndelta.com\n, the Fly Delta app, phone reservations, or ticket counters, for upgrades, miles, seat selection, Delta Sky Club\n\u00ae \nmembership, and in-flight purchases of food and beverages on Delta-operated flights (\u201cDelta Purchases\u201d). Delta Purchases do not include in-flight purchases where Delta is not the merchant of record, such as in-flight wireless internet access and charitable contributions. Delta Purchases do not include Delta Gift Cards and purchases made at\u00a0\ndeltashop.com\n\u00a0and/or the Delta Flight Museum. Delta Purchases include Delta Vacations\n\u00ae \npackages but not other all-inclusive packages. Delta Purchases include new Delta Stays prepaid hotel or vacation rental bookings on the Delta Stays platform (\ndelta.com/stays\n). Delta Purchases include purchases of qualifying Delta, Delta Connection\n\u00ae\n carrier and Delta Shuttle\n\u00ae \nflights taken with the purchase of a fare that is eligible for SkyMiles mileage credit. For purposes of this Card benefit, \u201cDelta Purchases\u201d also includes Delta Basic Economy fares, notwithstanding that these fares do not earn SkyMiles mileage credit for travel. Full SkyMiles program terms:\u00a0\ndelta.com/memberguide \n. Additional miles earned for Delta flight purchases made with the Card will be based on the total ticket price, including base fare, carrier-imposed surcharges and government-imposed taxes and fees.\nEligible purchases are purchases for goods and services minus returns and other credits. Eligible purchases do NOT include fees or interest charges, cash advances, purchases of travelers checks, purchases of gift cards, person-to-person transactions, purchases or reloading of prepaid cards, or purchases of other cash equivalents. Miles will be posted to the Basic Card Member\u2019s Delta SkyMiles account 8 to 12 weeks after the end of each month. To be eligible to receive miles, the Card Account must not be canceled or past due at the time of fulfillment.\nMerchants are assigned codes based on what they primarily sell. We group certain merchant codes into categories that are eligible for additional miles. A purchase with a merchant will not receive additional miles if the merchant\u2019s code is not included in a reward category. Basic Card Members may not receive additional miles if we receive inaccurate information or are otherwise unable to identify the purchase as eligible for a reward category. For example, Basic Card Members may not receive additional miles when: a merchant uses a third-party to sell their products or services; or a merchant uses a third-party to process or submit the transaction to us (e.g., using mobile or wireless card readers); or Card Members choose to make a purchase using a third-party payment account or make a purchase using a mobile or digital wallet.\nFor questions about additional miles on a purchase, call the number on the back of your Card. Please visit\u00a0\namericanexpress.com/rewards-info\n\u00a0for more information about rewards.\nGeneral: \nAll SkyMiles program rules apply.

Our students are certainly enjoying the weather!\u00a0 I want to take a moment to share a brief snapshot of some recent happenings around our campus:\nMinds that think\u2026\nWe jumped into Trimester 3 this week with some great projects all around the school across grades. At the middle school, the 7th graders are prepping for their Mock Trials next week and the 6th graders are planning their Medieval Feast while the 8th graders created Spanish books with their 2nd grade buddies. 7th and 8th graders are hard at work on their science fair projects and our 8th graders are also working diligently each day on their production of a \u201cMidsummer Night\u2019s Dream,\u201d memorizing lines, blocking scenes, and creating the set design. Our 4th graders are researching historical figures to bring to life at our annual Wax Museum. Mark your calendars for the 8th grade play on April 2 and the\u00a0 Science Fair, Art Fair and Wax Museum on April 24!\nHearts that love\u2026and hands that serve\nSoir\u00e9e Success \u2013 Thank You!\nWhat an incredible evening we had at this year\u2019s Soir\u00e9e! It was a fantastic celebration of our community, all while raising essential funds for tuition assistance. The NCA community at large showered their love and offered their service to make this event happen. A huge thank you to everyone who attended, participated in our raffle, and placed bids in our online auction. Most of all, thank you to our Soiree committee who took on a monumental task of planning this event,\u00a0 and to all the volunteers who helped the evening run smoothly. We are still finalizing the numbers and will share the impact of your generosity soon!\nLove and prayers for our Eighth Graders\nThis Friday is a nerve- wracking day for many of our eighth graders as they receive their selective enrollment and choice high school admissions decisions. Additionally, next Tuesday, many of them will be Confirmed in the Catholic Church. They have a lot on their plates on top of their intense academics. Let\u2019s keep these Wildcats in our prayers as they take these next steps in their journeys!\nThank you for your continued support and partnership in making NCA a place of faith, learning, and service.\nTerese \nUpcoming Dates:\n \nNCA Calendar\n \nMarch 5, 12, 19 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0Professional Development Early Dismissal: 2:10\n\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0ECP available\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\nMarch 16\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 Rehearsal for Confirmation Mass\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\n\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 11:30 St. Gertrude\nMarch 18\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 Confirmation Mass\u00a0\n\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a07:00 pm\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0\nMarch 21\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 Early Release for Spring Break 2:10\nMarch 24 \u2013 28\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 Spring Break\u00a0\nMarch 31\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 School Resumes\nApril 1\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0Lent Reconciliation Grades 3-8\n\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a09-10:30am; St Gertrude\u00a0 \u00a0*No All School Mass\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0this Tuesday\nApril 2, 9\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 Professional Development Early Dismissal:\u00a0 2:10\n\u00a0 \u00a0 16, 23, 30\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0ECP available\u00a0\nApril 2\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 8th Grade Play\u00a0\n\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 St. Gertrude Gym\nApril 9\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 First Reconciliation \u2013 2nd grade\nSchool News & Updates\n \nREENROLLMENT DEALINE APPROACHING\nReenroll by March 15th to secure your spot at NCA for the 2025-2026 schoolyear.

    "body": "Plus, Steppenwolf\u2019s lineup for its 50th anniversary season. Here\u2019s what you need to know today.\n \n.\nTo view this email as a web page, click \nhere.\nWednesday - March 12, 2025\nToday's \nRundown\n is brought to you by WBEZ members and\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\nby Esther Bergdahl\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\nGood afternoon! No matter what your area code, Chicago has something fun for you to do on \n312 Day\n. As for the rest of the news, here\u2019s what you need to know today.\n\u00a0 \nSUPPORT THE RUNDOWN TODAY:\u00a0\nYou could win a 6-night stay in Ireland!\u00a0\nDONATE\n1.\nHow chaos at the Education Department impacts Illinois schools\n\u00a0\nThe federal Department of Education announced last night more than 1,300 layoffs as part of a plan to reduce staffing by 50% through layoffs, buyouts and terminations.\nThe $79 billion agency, which employed 4,100 people when President Donald Trump was inaugurated, oversees federal financial aid for college students and offers oversight of special education services and civil rights laws that could be at risk.\nThe Trump administration\u2019s proposal to dismantle the Education Department would play out differently locally and statewide. If, for instance, federal education funding is reduced \u2014 by Congress or by other means \u2014 Illinois and Chicago schools wouldn\u2019t lose the majority of their education revenue, but they would be hurt. Most school funding in Illinois comes from local property taxes and the state. This school year, federal funding makes up about 16% of the $8.4 billion Chicago Public Schools operating budget.\nHowever, federal funding also concerns higher education, in itself a major economic driver in communities nationwide, my colleagues Nader Issa and Lisa Kurian Philip report.\n\u201cIt\u2019s going to potentially put an end to my research career, and we won\u2019t be able to develop these new therapies for diabetic wounds,\u201d said one UIC professor of newly decimated federal research grants. \u201cIt\u2019s the worst situation that I\u2019ve encountered in my 25-year career.\u201d [\nWBEZ\n]\n2.\nFederal officials drop a plan to expand a lakeside dump on the Southeast Side\n\u00a0\nThe U.S. Army Corps of Engineers is responsible for making sure the bottom of the Calumet River \u2014 a major waterway for commercial shipping in and out of Chicago \u2014 is deep enough to allow boats to easily navigate the water.\nThe dredged sediment from the bottom, contaminated by pollution, has been stored for decades just north of Calumet Park along Lake Michigan, my colleague Brett Chase reports for the Sun-Times. After sustained community opposition and a lawsuit, the Army Corps has set aside longstanding plans to expand an underwater landfill known as a \u201cconfined disposal facility\u201d in favor of a \u201csustainable and feasible alternative.\u201d [\nChicago Sun-Times\n]\nMeanwhile, the Chicago Tribune reports Chicago still ranks in the top 10 most polluted major cities in the U.S., even as we dropped from 2nd place to 7th in 2024. [\nChicago Tribune\n]\nSPONSOR MESSAGE FROM COLUMBIA COLLEGE CHICAGO\nColumbia College Chicago Celebrates 135 Years\nAs Columbia marks its 135th year, it celebrates a legacy rich in creativity, innovation, and resilience and its enduring commitment to shaping the arts, media, technology, and business. As we honor our past, we look forward to continuing our tradition of nurturing creative minds and shaping what\u2019s next in the years to come. Learn more at \ncolum.edu.\n3.\nFinal phase of Kennedy Expressway construction expected to begin next week\n\u00a0\nOutbound lanes will be reduced and reversible lanes become permanently outbound until the fall, writes my colleague Dave Struett at the Sun-Times. Drivers should expect \u201csignificant delays\u201d when the work begins on Tuesday, weather permitting, the Illinois Department of Transportation said in a news release.\nClosures will begin this week to set up the work zone. Drivers should expect overnight ramp and lane closures from Ohio Street and Montrose Avenue between 9 p.m. and 5 a.m.\nConstruction is expected to be completed \u201caround Thanksgiving,\u201d the Transportation Department said. Improvements to the reversible lanes were completed last year. The inbound Kennedy was revamped in 2023. [\nChicago Sun-Times\n]\n4.\nChicago Ukrainians fear deportations as Trump considers revoking legal status\n\u00a0\nLike many of the 40,000-plus Ukrainians who have arrived in Chicago since Russia invaded their homeland, 37-year-old Inha Ruda and her family entered the U.S. on a temporary humanitarian parole status that President Donald Trump is considering revoking.\nOthers could lose their legal status even sooner \u2014 perhaps as early as May \u2014 if Trump shuts down temporary protections issued by former President Joe Biden that have allowed 240,000 Ukrainians fleeing the war to come to the U.S.\n\u201cIt\u2019s hard to imagine how we\u2019ve started step by step, getting documents, finding jobs, everything new. We finally have safety, schools, everything good, and then somebody makes a decision that everything stops and now you have to go,\u201d she said. \u201cIt\u2019s difficult.\u201d [\nChicago Sun-Times\n]\n5.\nSteppenwolf's \u2018slate of rock stars\u2019 on tap for theater company\u2019s 50th anniversary season\n\u00a0\nThe anniversary season includes the world premiere of \nWindfall\n (April 9\u2013May 31, 2026), penned by ensemble member Tarell Alvin McCraney (an Academy Award winner for \nMoonlight\n, the film adaptation of his play \nIn Moonlight Black Boys Look Blue\n).\nOther highlights include works by heavyweights Suzan-Lori Parks, Mia Chung and ensemble member Rajiv Joseph. The season\u2019s concluding flourish is Peter Shaffer\u2019s \nAmadeus\n (Nov. 6, 2025\u2013Jan. 4, 2026), the Tony and Academy Award\u2013winning fictional account of the rivalry between composers Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart and Antonio Salieri.\n\u201cChicago has really been here for the repeated relationships with our ensemble members,\u201d co-artistic director Audrey Francis told my colleague Mike Davis. \u201cThey have this investment in our artistic journey and our evolution, and they have let us grow as artists and change. Every time we get on stage, they give us the opportunity to reinvent not only who we are but what we\u2019re capable of.\u201d [\nWBEZ\n]\n\u00a0\nHere's what else is happening\n\u00a0\nThe European Union has joined Canada in imposing tariffs on American goods, including bourbon, beef, jeans and motorcycles. [\nAP\n]\nWhen one Congressman misgendered a fellow committee member during a hearing yesterday, transgender Delaware Rep. Sarah McBride responded in kind, saying, \u201cThank you, Madam Chair.\u201d [\nTexas Tribune\n]\nElections in Greenland reacted to Trump\u2019s vocal designs on the Arctic nation, rocketing the independence-minded Demokraatit party into power. [\nThe Guardian\n]\nThe Transportation Security Administration stopped a would-be passenger at Newark International Airport last week: a 5-inch red-eared slider turtle stashed inside a man\u2019s pants. [\nTSA\n]\n\u00a0\nOh, and one more thing...\n\u00a0\nFrom the air above O\u2019Hare International Airport, Resthaven Cemetery looks like an island in a sea of beige. The view is barely less odd from the ground: about an acre and a half of land, one side surrounded by a low chain-link fence, the other by shrubby trees that block the runway directly adjacent. Across from the cemetery is a soulless gray and white Fedex Shipping facility filled with docked semitrucks.\n\u201cIt\u2019s kind of unique, standing in the middle of O\u2019Hare Field, listening to airplanes,\u201d says Resthaven caretaker Mike Moruzzi. \u201cIt gives [the cemetery] some character. It\u2019s an ambiance.\u201d\nIn many ways, Resthaven is a microcosm of the village of Bensenville\u2019s long history of being slowly eaten by development. It\u2019s a tale of what is sacrificed in the name of progress and the tension between the rights of a suburb and the city. It also evokes a contentious piece of local history which dates back decades before the Civil War.

It's Time to Pivot.\nFear is beginning to ripple across the U.S., and in other nations that have traditionally supported American businesses, citizens, and tourists. When people are fearful or worried, they change behaviors. Understand how these changes will affect your organization. For example:\nMore Federal government workers are applying for unemployment. Because States were unprepared for a massive influx in traffic, there could be delays in processing requests. This will drive up competition for jobs as well as cause financial hardships for new recruits. Is your system designed to handle increased activity? Will Algorithmic bias screen out applicants? How long is your recruitment cycle? Are unnecessary delays built into the process?\nSince some nonprofits were impacted by budget changes in Washington, they may not have the capacity to serve as many people as they did previously. What are your requirements and expectations for corporate giving and reporting?\nImpending social security cuts, as well as fluctuations in the stock market, will impact 401K/403B plans, as well as those who were planning to retire this year or are currently retired. Do you have a plan to engage older workers?\nSome small businesses are no longer operating because they lost their federal government contracts, boycotts are in play, and tariffs are about to kick in. What is your plan for diversifying the supply chain?\nAdd in the potential for a measles outbreak, climate emergency, or other disasters, there is a possibility that work-from-home becomes a necessity again. Have your policies been updated since the COVID work-from-home experience?\nLayoff's are hitting some industries worse than others. If you needed to pivot to another field, what are your transferrable skills?\nSome people still believe that cuts to Diversity, Equity, Inclusion, and Accessibility justify any economic hardships, but the reality is that the world is a little more complex than the hate that one person has for another individual or group.\nThe reality is that today's professionals must be prepared for anything.

    "body": "Thank you for attending Beyond\n the DEI Headlines: Actionable Insights\n. The feedback was overwhelmingly positive. Here's what one \nattendee\n\u00a0had to say, \"The event was\u00a0powerful and insightful.\"\nClick to hear Karen Brown's opening remarks and read key points below.\n \nImpact of Executive Orders on DEI:\n The president\u2019s executive orders and other actions are significantly affecting diversity, equity, inclusion (DEI), equal opportunity (EEO), and affirmative action (AA) work. efforts. These changes are reshaping the approach organizations take toward this work.\nMixed Responses from Executives:\n While many CEOs, board members, and DEI leaders remain committed, some are re-evaluating their efforts, with a significant number scaling back or canceling programs due to concerns over compliance, government actions, and legal risks.\nSurvey Findings:\n A recent\n survey\n of C-suite executives found that a growing number (53%) expect anti-DEI policies from the White House to lead them to roll back their DEI programs. Additionally, 55% are increasingly concerned about DEI-related lawsuits and government enforcement. Many executives, especially at federal contractors and public companies, are considering reducing or removing DEI-related language from public communications like websites and proxy statements due to mounting regulatory pressures.\n \nClick to hear Paulette Brown's remarks and read key points below. \nImpact of Executive Orders:\n Paulette emphasizes the significant impact of recent executive orders on diversity, equity, and inclusion initiatives, likening it to chaos and confusion. Despite some orders aiming to restrict this work, they have not overturned existing laws, such as the Civil Rights Act of 1964. She emphasized that diversity, equity, and inclusion are not illegal.\nLegal Risks and Compliance:\n She stresses that diversity, equity, and inclusion work must not violate any existing laws, and although there is fear of potential legal repercussions, many lawsuits challenging these orders have been filed, some resulting in temporary injunctions. Organizations should consult legal counsel to understand their potential liabilities.\nBusiness Decision:\n Paulette notes that organizations are taking preemptive measures out of fear, which may not be necessary. She argues that stepping away from DEI is not a good business decision, citing the example of \nTarget's\n \ndecreased profits. These companies also risk alienating a broad base of customers and supporters.\nCommunity and Collaboration:\n Paulette encourages building a community and fostering collaborations to navigate the challenges posed by executive orders. Nonprofit organizations are encouraged to seek out resources such as the \nFunders for Justice\n, \nDemocracy Forward\n, and the \nNational Council of Nonprofits\n to navigate challenges related to DEI programs and government funding.\nThe Importance of Courage and Collaboration:\n She advocates for maintaining courage in the face of fear and working together to continue this work. Building collaborative communities and ensuring internal alignment within organizations is key to successfully navigating current challenges and fulfilling legal obligations while promoting equity.\n \nClick to hear Hugo Balta's remarks and read key points below. \nHistorical Context:\n Hugo provides a historical context of diversity, equity, and inclusion work, emphasizing their development in response to address systemic inequalities in workplaces, education, and society. Their goals include promoting representation, dismantling barriers, fostering inclusive environments, and improving collaboration and innovation through diverse perspectives.\nMisalignment:\n He notes that despite good intentions, many corporations struggle with effective implementation. He shares the misalignment between corporate values and actions, the issue of tokenism, the lack of accountability and clear metrics, and resistance from leadership or employees, which all hinder the success of DEI initiatives.\u00a0\nWeaponization of DEI:\n Hugo explains how diversity, equity, and inclusion have been weaponized because they are incorrectly positioned as problems rather than opportunities. He offers that the current administration\u2019s policies aimed at curtailing diversity training and promoting a merit-based approach are oversimplifying the issue and a misunderstanding of the need for equity. Hugo argues that merit-based hiring and diversity, equity, and inclusion can coexist. He highlights the legal challenges and public advocacy campaigns in response to the current administration's stance.\u00a0\nThe Importance of Framing DEI as Opportunity:\n He stresses that diversity, equity, and inclusion should be viewed as an opportunity to improve and create inclusive environments, not just a problem to solve. Mis-framing it as a problem leads to ineffective actions while recognizing it as an opportunity fosters more genuine and collaborative solutions.\u00a0\nThe Ongoing Fight for DEI:\n Hugo encourages individuals and organizations to continue pushing forward. It's crucial to stay courageous, foster alliances, and advocate for diversity, equity, and inclusion as foundational elements in creating systems that benefit everyone equitably.\n \nClick to hear Peter Cunningham's remarks and read key points below. \nPeter states that with clients, he starts by focusing on values, then facts, followed by multi-dimensionality.\nShared Values:\n \nHe denotes the importance of starting diversity, equity, and inclusion conversations in the context of the company\u2019s shared values. These could be profits, inclusion, safety from harassment, creative problem-solving, environmentalism, and inclusion.\nConcrete Facts:\n He advocates for using concrete facts in diversity, equity, and inclusion discussions to avoid fruitless debates.\nMultidimensional Approach:\n Peter highlights the multidimensional nature of diversity, equity, and inclusion, including veterans, race, gender, age, disabilities, and more. Successful diversity, equity, and inclusion initiatives should aim to create a \"bigger tent\" that includes as many people as possible, ensuring broad engagement.\nCase for DEI: \nHe offers the importance of being clear about the case for diversity, equity, and inclusion, which could be linked to customer value, employee morale, creative problem-solving, or business competitiveness.\u00a0\nCommunication Strategy:\n Peter stresses the following important points when developing a communication strategy:\n \nFraming diversity, equity, and inclusion discussions in a way that avoids extremism and judgment.\u00a0\nRecognize the dynamic cultural environment and tailor your approach to different audiences.\u00a0\nFrame the conversation to emphasize inclusion as a business and morale-boosting strategy rather than as a politically charged issue.\u00a0\nSpecifically\n\u00a0for DEI, there\u2019s a ripe\u00a0opportunity for the DEI community to take ownership of the messaging on fairness and merit-based hiring because it cuts both ways.\nIt\u2019s prudent to have a one-minute elevator speech. His\u00a0example:\nThe 60-Second Case for DEI\n\u00a0\"Whether you work in business, government, the non-profit world or academia, your work is shaped by values\u2014yours, your co-workers, your employers. Most of us want a safe workplace that is free of harassment. Most of us want a diverse workplace. Most of us want an efficient, effective workplace. And we all believe that we should hire the very best people possible to do the job. No one wants to work with low-performers. No one wants to hire them.\nActing on those values and goals, our organization is making sure that we are not \u2013 either intentionally or unintentionally \u2013 tilting the playing field in any one direction that could undermine us. Too many people of one gender or race or faith or viewpoint, or too few people with differing views and different skills, will undermine our larger goals, whether that be profits in the case of a private company, or impact in the case of a non-profit, or service in the case of a public agency. Diversity helps advance our values and goals. It challenges our thinking. Surveys show that diverse workplaces appeal to customers and the public, they boost morale, there is less turnover, and better bottom-line results. To paraphrase the Godfather Michael Corleone, \u201cDEI isn\u2019t just personal. It\u2019s business.\u201d\u00a0\nClick to hear Jennifer Brown's closing remarks and read key points below. \nThe Need for a 1.0 Conversation:\n\u00a0\nWe've\n\u00a0been having a 3.0 conversation and there's a call for a return to a foundational, less extreme conversation about diversity, equity, and inclusion. After the high-energy moments of the last few years, it's time to slow down, reassess, and revisit the basics to ensure that the conversation is digestible and effective for everyone involved.\nBe Strategic and Cautious:\n As organizations navigate the evolving landscape, it\u2019s essential to avoid drastic policy changes. While there may be pressure to adjust, dismantling or backtracking on progress could set the field back years.

    "body": "Thank you for attending Beyond\n the DEI Headlines: Actionable Insights\n. The feedback was overwhelmingly positive. Here's what one \nattendee\n\u00a0had to say, \"The event was\u00a0powerful and insightful.\"\nClick to hear Karen Brown's opening remarks and read key points below.\n \nImpact of Executive Orders on DEI:\n The president\u2019s executive orders and other actions are significantly affecting diversity, equity, inclusion (DEI), equal opportunity (EEO), and affirmative action (AA) work. efforts. These changes are reshaping the approach organizations take toward this work.\nMixed Responses from Executives:\n While many CEOs, board members, and DEI leaders remain committed, some are re-evaluating their efforts, with a significant number scaling back or canceling programs due to concerns over compliance, government actions, and legal risks.\nSurvey Findings:\n A recent\n survey\n of C-suite executives found that a growing number (53%) expect anti-DEI policies from the White House to lead them to roll back their DEI programs. Additionally, 55% are increasingly concerned about DEI-related lawsuits and government enforcement. Many executives, especially at federal contractors and public companies, are considering reducing or removing DEI-related language from public communications like websites and proxy statements due to mounting regulatory pressures.\n \nClick to hear Paulette Brown's remarks and read key points below. \nImpact of Executive Orders:\n Paulette emphasizes the significant impact of recent executive orders on diversity, equity, and inclusion initiatives, likening it to chaos and confusion. Despite some orders aiming to restrict this work, they have not overturned existing laws, such as the Civil Rights Act of 1964. She emphasized that diversity, equity, and inclusion are not illegal.\nLegal Risks and Compliance:\n She stresses that diversity, equity, and inclusion work must not violate any existing laws, and although there is fear of potential legal repercussions, many lawsuits challenging these orders have been filed, some resulting in temporary injunctions. Organizations should consult legal counsel to understand their potential liabilities.\nBusiness Decision:\n Paulette notes that organizations are taking preemptive measures out of fear, which may not be necessary. She argues that stepping away from DEI is not a good business decision, citing the example of \nTarget's\n \ndecreased profits. These companies also risk alienating a broad base of customers and supporters.\nCommunity and Collaboration:\n Paulette encourages building a community and fostering collaborations to navigate the challenges posed by executive orders. Nonprofit organizations are encouraged to seek out resources such as the \nFunders for Justice\n, \nDemocracy Forward\n, and the \nNational Council of Nonprofits\n to navigate challenges related to DEI programs and government funding.\nThe Importance of Courage and Collaboration:\n She advocates for maintaining courage in the face of fear and working together to continue this work. Building collaborative communities and ensuring internal alignment within organizations is key to successfully navigating current challenges and fulfilling legal obligations while promoting equity.\n \nClick to hear Hugo Balta's remarks and read key points below. \nHistorical Context:\n Hugo provides a historical context of diversity, equity, and inclusion work, emphasizing their development in response to address systemic inequalities in workplaces, education, and society. Their goals include promoting representation, dismantling barriers, fostering inclusive environments, and improving collaboration and innovation through diverse perspectives.\nMisalignment:\n He notes that despite good intentions, many corporations struggle with effective implementation. He shares the misalignment between corporate values and actions, the issue of tokenism, the lack of accountability and clear metrics, and resistance from leadership or employees, which all hinder the success of DEI initiatives.\u00a0\nWeaponization of DEI:\n Hugo explains how diversity, equity, and inclusion have been weaponized because they are incorrectly positioned as problems rather than opportunities. He offers that the current administration\u2019s policies aimed at curtailing diversity training and promoting a merit-based approach are oversimplifying the issue and a misunderstanding of the need for equity. Hugo argues that merit-based hiring and diversity, equity, and inclusion can coexist. He highlights the legal challenges and public advocacy campaigns in response to the current administration's stance.\u00a0\nThe Importance of Framing DEI as Opportunity:\n He stresses that diversity, equity, and inclusion should be viewed as an opportunity to improve and create inclusive environments, not just a problem to solve. Mis-framing it as a problem leads to ineffective actions while recognizing it as an opportunity fosters more genuine and collaborative solutions.\u00a0\nThe Ongoing Fight for DEI:\n Hugo encourages individuals and organizations to continue pushing forward. It's crucial to stay courageous, foster alliances, and advocate for diversity, equity, and inclusion as foundational elements in creating systems that benefit everyone equitably.\n \nClick to hear Peter Cunningham's remarks and read key points below. \nPeter states that with clients, he starts by focusing on values, then facts, followed by multi-dimensionality.\nShared Values:\n \nHe denotes the importance of starting diversity, equity, and inclusion conversations in the context of the company\u2019s shared values. These could be profits, inclusion, safety from harassment, creative problem-solving, environmentalism, and inclusion.\nConcrete Facts:\n He advocates for using concrete facts in diversity, equity, and inclusion discussions to avoid fruitless debates.\nMultidimensional Approach:\n Peter highlights the multidimensional nature of diversity, equity, and inclusion, including veterans, race, gender, age, disabilities, and more. Successful diversity, equity, and inclusion initiatives should aim to create a \"bigger tent\" that includes as many people as possible, ensuring broad engagement.\nCase for DEI: \nHe offers the importance of being clear about the case for diversity, equity, and inclusion, which could be linked to customer value, employee morale, creative problem-solving, or business competitiveness.\u00a0\nCommunication Strategy:\n Peter stresses the following important points when developing a communication strategy:\n \nFraming diversity, equity, and inclusion discussions in a way that avoids extremism and judgment.\u00a0\nRecognize the dynamic cultural environment and tailor your approach to different audiences.\u00a0\nFrame the conversation to emphasize inclusion as a business and morale-boosting strategy rather than as a politically charged issue.\u00a0\nSpecifically\n\u00a0for DEI, there\u2019s a ripe\u00a0opportunity for the DEI community to take ownership of the messaging on fairness and merit-based hiring because it cuts both ways.\nIt\u2019s prudent to have a one-minute elevator speech. His\u00a0example:\nThe 60-Second Case for DEI\n\u00a0\"Whether you work in business, government, the non-profit world or academia, your work is shaped by values\u2014yours, your co-workers, your employers. Most of us want a safe workplace that is free of harassment. Most of us want a diverse workplace. Most of us want an efficient, effective workplace. And we all believe that we should hire the very best people possible to do the job. No one wants to work with low-performers. No one wants to hire them.\nActing on those values and goals, our organization is making sure that we are not \u2013 either intentionally or unintentionally \u2013 tilting the playing field in any one direction that could undermine us. Too many people of one gender or race or faith or viewpoint, or too few people with differing views and different skills, will undermine our larger goals, whether that be profits in the case of a private company, or impact in the case of a non-profit, or service in the case of a public agency. Diversity helps advance our values and goals. It challenges our thinking. Surveys show that diverse workplaces appeal to customers and the public, they boost morale, there is less turnover, and better bottom-line results. To paraphrase the Godfather Michael Corleone, \u201cDEI isn\u2019t just personal. It\u2019s business.\u201d\u00a0\nClick to hear Jennifer Brown's closing remarks and read key points below. \nThe Need for a 1.0 Conversation:\n\u00a0\nWe've\n\u00a0been having a 3.0 conversation and there's a call for a return to a foundational, less extreme conversation about diversity, equity, and inclusion. After the high-energy moments of the last few years, it's time to slow down, reassess, and revisit the basics to ensure that the conversation is digestible and effective for everyone involved.\nBe Strategic and Cautious:\n As organizations navigate the evolving landscape, it\u2019s essential to avoid drastic policy changes. While there may be pressure to adjust, dismantling or backtracking on progress could set the field back years. Leaders should be strategic and careful, staying informed about the law and the long-term implications of their decisions.\nPrepare for the Future with a Broader Tent:\n The pendulum will swing again, and when it does, it\u2019s important to be ready with a new, inclusive playbook. We need to be introspective, learn from past mistakes, and ensure that when future opportunities arise, we approach the conversation with a broader perspective, avoiding exclusionary messages, and fostering a more inclusive dialogue.\nHave more questions about this topic or others?

Success in federal contracting requires a combination of factors, including being in the right industry, eligible for certifications, and having a solid grasp of government procurement processes. From GSA Schedules and subcontracting opportunities to niche markets and contract size, understanding these key elements is crucial for achieving success in the federal market.\nContributing Elements for Success\nIndustry\nIs your business in a sector where the federal government buys your products and services? should be the first thing a company looks at. What geographical area can you also offer your products and services? Although the government often purchases the majority of goods, there are benefits to being local.\nEligible for a Certification\nYour businesses will be given preference if you are certified. Certain certificates have greater weight with some agencies than others. Yet early in the process, you should check to see if your company qualifies for and submit an application for all federal certifications.\n8(a) \u2013 Minority Owned\nHUBZone \u2013 Historically Underutilized Zone\nWOSB \u2013 Woman Owned Firm\u00a0\nSDVOSB \u2013 Service-Disabled Firm\nGSA Schedule other GWACS\nGovernment purchasers can easily acquire from your company thanks to GSA Schedules and other Governmentwide Acquisition Contracts. Going with the flow, like everything else in life, typically produces better outcomes than going against it.\nGSA Schedule also gives your company more visibility since GSA Advantage is the web portal that federal buyers utilize to find suppliers of goods and services when they do not already have a relationship with an incumbent.\nSubcontracting\nCompared to the size of the small business direct to government market, the federal subcontracting market is sizable and accounts for around 70% of it. A company can get experience with an agency by working for significant federal contractors. Since most small businesses only interact with one or two agencies, working as a sub can help you gain insight into how an agency operates, what resources it requires, and who to contact.\nAm I in a Niche Market\nNiche markets can also be beneficial. I once had a job with a company that produced specialized shovels for putting out forest fires. Finding the proper person was difficult, but once they did, business flourished.\nContract Size\nThe Simplified Acquisition Procedures apply to contracts worth up to $250,000. In the absence of a suitable small company supplier, these contracts should go to small businesses, unless otherwise noted by the procurement officer. Companies in sectors where this level of contract is frequently awarded have an edge in the federal market.\nAchieving success in federal contracting requires a thoughtful consideration of the various contributing elements. By understanding the importance of industry, certifications, GSA Schedules, subcontracting, niche markets, and contract size, you can position your small business for success.

    "body": "Plus: Employee Confidence At An All-Time Low | Diddy Accused of Forced Labor Practices | Universities Hit With Hiring Freezes\nBECOME A MEMBER\n\u00a0\u2022\u00a0\nNewsletters\n\u00a0\u2022\u00a0\nMyForbes\nPresented by\nDo you remember where you were on March 11, 2020?\u00a0\nFive years ago this week, the World Health Organization declared Covid-19 a pandemic, sending workers home from the office and shuttering businesses worldwide. Since then, we\u2019ve experienced a shifting job market, expectations and locations.\u00a0\nWhat began as an employee-friendly job market amid\u00a0 \u201cThe Great Resignation\u201d has turned into one where employers are holding the purse strings and workers are feeling as unmotivated as ever.\u00a0\nThis uncertainty has led to the rise of\u00a0 \u201cThe Great Detachment,\u201d what experts are calling this period of falling employee engagement, satisfaction and choice. At its core is \u201cthe manager squeeze,\u201d says Jim Harter, chief scientist of workplace management and well-being at Gallup, who \npublished an analysis\n of the last five years.\u00a0\n\u201cHow people are managed on a daily basis is multiples more important\u201d than hybrid work policies, he says. \u201cThe role of first leadership is saying \u2018here\u2019s the culture that we want, and here\u2019s how our practices are going to reinforce that culture that we want,\u2019 and then to articulate it in a way that\u2019s clear to employees.\u201d\nBut how to do that when many folks have been forced to do more with less?\u00a0\nManagers seem to have gotten the short end of the stick on both ends of the corporate ladder, as they are tasked with carrying on in \u201cthe year of efficiency\u201d while also lacking the training and support to coach their direct reports.\nThis is not only impacting performance and productivity rates (though productivity \nrebounded at the end of 2024\n), but such work cultures can be counterproductive to the motto of efficiency.\u00a0\n\u201cEfficiency becomes more of an uphill battle when folks aren\u2019t in predictable places,\u201d whether that be financially or physically, says Harter. Such uncertainty is one of the reasons engagement rates have plummeted in the last year (read more below on how we arrived at The Great Detachment).\u00a0\nYes, it\u2019s a bleak mark for the state of work in 2025, but Harter is optimistic that it doesn\u2019t \nhave\n to be all doom and gloom\u2013\u2013there are still employers out there who are beating the trend.\u00a0\nHappy reading, and hope you have a lovely week!\nMaria Gracia Santillana Linares\u00a0\nCareers Reporter\nFollow me on\u00a0\nForbes.com\nWORK SMARTER\nPractical insights and advice from \nForbes\n staff and contributors to help you succeed in your job, accelerate your career and lead smarter.\nIf you are one of the \ngovernment workers impacted by DOGE cuts\n, here\u2019s what you need to know about the \nprivate sector.\u00a0\nSpring is near and it may just be the\n best time to interview and\n\u00a0\nland a new job.\u00a0\nIf you\u2019ve recently been laid off, here\u2019s why \nCOBRA could be the \ncheapest health insurance\n\u00a0\noption.\u00a0\nBeware of these 10 \noverused marketing phrases\n and\n\u00a0\ntry these instead.\u00a0\nDeep Dive\nThe Great Detachment means American workers' confidence is hitting new lows. \n\u00a0 \nGetty Images\nDeep Dive: Americans\u2019 Confidence At Work Is Down In The Dumps\nRead Article\nNew reports from Glassdoor, LinkedIn and Gallup all point to one staggering, if depressing, conclusion about the American workforce: Confidence and satisfaction is at an all-time low. How did we get here?\nIt\u2019s a bleak time to be an American worker. Between the fear of layoffs, lack of engagement and confidence in their own employment, employees in the U.S. are feeling less motivated than ever.\u00a0\nFor one, the job market is incredibly competitive. It\u2019s taking most job seekers over six months to find a new position, according to LinkedIn, and economic uncertainty coupled with fast-changing federal regulations is making workers \nlack a sense of job security\n.\u00a0\nThe fear of layoffs is a major factor in this job security anxiety. Glassdoor\u2019s monthly employee confidence index hit an\n\u00a0\nall-time low in February,\n dropping to levels not seen since the company started tracking it in 2016. Mentions of layoffs in company reviews are up 5% from last February, the highest Glassdoor has seen since July 2020, when the pandemic had seemingly no end in sight.\u00a0\u00a0\nSo why is this happening? According to Gallup\u2019s Jim Harter, it\u2019s likely because of a serious shift in change management. While employers were celebrated by their workers for clearly and transparently communicating changes during the pandemic, that communication changed during the Great Resignation of 2021.\u00a0\n\u201cLeadership took their eye off the ball in terms of really thinking holistically about what they want as an organization. Some people are saying, \u2018Well, for us to have a culture, we need to be in the office,\u2019\u201d Harter says. \u201cBut when you\u2019re taking that autonomy away from people, it stings a bit. So you\u2019ve gotta have really clear communication with them about the why.\u201d\nIt all builds up: Without clear communication, employees are more likely to feel like they do not align with the company\u2019s vision and that their work doesn\u2019t matter, increasing the detachment and feelings of not being engaged. And it\u2019s not temporary. Employers should be keeping the workforce engaged even when the market is in their favor.\u00a0\n\u201cDuring the pandemic to some extent, people remembered how they were treated, and then they acted on it when they had a choice by leaving\u201d Harter adds. So while workers largely feel stuck today, it doesn\u2019t mean they won\u2019t leave should a better choice come along.\u00a0 \nTOUCH BASE\n \nA Growing Side Hustle For American College Grads: Fixing AI\u2019s Wrong Answers\n\u00a0 \nILLUSTRATION BY EMILY SCHERER FOR FORBES; IMAGE BY C.J.

However, some Caucasian women-owned businesses may mistakenly assume they are not eligible for the 8(a) program because they do not fit the commonly perceived definition of a minority business.\nThe reality is that Caucasian women-owned businesses can qualify for 8(a) certification, provided they meet the established criteria and submit the necessary documentation to demonstrate their disadvantaged status.\nRequirements for 8(a) Program Participation:\nTo participate in the 8(a) program, businesses must:\nMeet the definition of a small business.\nNot have previously participated in the 8(a) program.\nBe at least 51% owned and controlled by U.S. citizens who are socially and economically disadvantaged, with supporting proof.\nMeet specific financial criteria, including:\n\ufeff\n\ufeff\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\n\ufeff\n\ufeff\n\ufeff\n\ufeff\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\n\ufeff\n\ufeff\n\ufeff\n\ufeff\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\n\ufeff\n\ufeff\n\ufeff\n\ufeff\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\n\ufeff\n\ufeff\n**Personal net worth of $850 thousand or less.\n\ufeff\n\ufeff\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\n\ufeff\n\ufeff\n\ufeff\n\ufeff\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\n\ufeff\n\ufeff\n\ufeff\n\ufeff\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\n\ufeff\n\ufeff\n\ufeff\n\ufeff\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\n\ufeff\n\ufeff\n**Adjusted gross income of $400 thousand or less.\n\ufeff\n\ufeff\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\n\ufeff\n\ufeff\n\ufeff\n\ufeff\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\n\ufeff\n\ufeff\n\ufeff\n\ufeff\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\n\ufeff\n\ufeff\n\ufeff\n\ufeff\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\n\ufeff\n\ufeff\n**Total assets valued at $6.5 million or less.\nDemonstrate good character.\nHave been in business for at least two years.\nThe Social Disadvantage Narrative:\nWhen applying for 8(a) certification, applicants must submit a social disadvantage narrative.

While there, I ran into a young writer and publisher, Delvin Howell. I was intrigued both because he was doing fantasy, and because he'd set up his own imprint. As a writer, Delvin had a lot to say, so this interview is split into two parts. Here's the first:\nDelvin, what made you become a writer?\nAs a toddler, I was always fascinated by stories. After every episode of a cartoon show, I would make my own version where things went differently than was aired. For example, maybe the villain won in the end, or the damsel saved herself instead of waiting for the hero to come. This fascination evolved into making my own characters and comics along with my longest-standing friend, Jaryd Niles Morris since primary school. \nWe had no idea what we were doing. These were rough approximations of our favourite stories at the time, but we made these comics throughout secondary school until we were forced to consider a career path. In Barbados, animation and film were not industries that existed even back in early 2000s, so we had to make a decision of what to pursue after school. Jaryd went on to have a successful career in commercial photography and creative design, and I went on to pursue economics and law. \nHowever, before we stopped working together, two things happened. \n1. He exposed me to Japanese comics, which changed my outlook on the medium and what narrative possibilities could exist within it. \n2. We came up with the idea about a Bajan (Barbadian) comic with a dude who did stick-licking and fought with sugarcane - a simple sometimes comedic idea that would evolve into the \nOffset\n series. \nA lasting story idea\nOffset \nwas that one story idea I could not let go from my mind. It lingered, grew and transformed the more I thought about it. I believed that if we did a Bajan comic story, it did not have to be done as a joke. It had just as much potential to be taken as seriously as any of the other titles we knew. \nHarry Potter/ Lord of the Rings\n leveraged European culture and customs. Japanese titles like \nDragonball\n and \nNaruto \ndid the same with Japanese culture. Why couldn\u2019t we do the same with our own stories? \nOffset \ngrew with that in mind. \nLuckily, Jaryd introduced me to Matthew Clarke who was doing comics in Barbados and at a level close to what I enjoyed from Japan. When I saw his work, I believed things were possible. However, as Matthew was busy with school, I grew impatient after graduating university myself, so I decided to take the plunge and write the manuscript for the first entry of the series, \nOffset: The Mask of Bimshire*\n. This eventually won the Frank Collymore Literary Endowment Award for Young Writers in 2010. \nMeanwhile, Matthew had an innovative idea to do an anthology series gathering stories and comics from local creators into one book called \nMASS Anthology\n. This included a one-shot comic from Offset which captured an amazing battle between two of the characters, Kyle Harding & Damian Collins. Through this endeavour I met several other local creators including Tristan Roach who went on to illustrate \nOffset\n. \nMatthew, Tristan, myself and Alan Lynch would go on to become co-founders of Beyond Publishing Caribbean, a publisher of Caribbean comics. We have released multiple titles across many genres. \nEnjoyed this interview? You can \nbuy me a coffee\n or \nupgrade to a paid subscription\n to support my work.\n\ufeff\nTell us more about your writing\nI usually write fantasy. However, I do dabble in elements of drama, science fiction and horror from time to time. I am known within the group as a war monger- as I love a good action scene. However, I believe in emotional impact whenever possible within any stories I make. The more emotion you feel from reading my stories the better. Fantasy also allows me to twist things that exists in the real world, even going to surreal places just to ensure the emotion is felt in the scenes. \nI have written two titles to date. \nOffset \nwhich follows a young \nstick-licker\n named Kyle Harding who discovers an underground obeah trade in the Caribbean island of Bimshire. It combines elements of Caribbean Folklore, Crime Drama, Martial-arts action and Family secrets in an explosive urban fantasy tale. The Offset series consists of two novels: \nOffset: Mask of Bimshire\n, \nOffset: Children of the Gulf\n and a comic/ graphic novel adaptation \u2013 \nOffset Volume #1\n (which covers four issues). \nOFFSET SHOW FLOOR VIDEO \nLoose Change\n is a comic series that takes place in a prestigious business school that consistently breeds multi-millionaires and evaluates you on your ability to make money. It has two primary protagonists, Desmond \u2018Dez\u2019 Holdipp, a genius boy from extremely humble roots who wants to learn how money works to repay his mother who worked hard to make sure he received an education, and Marcella \u2018Marcy\u2019 Fowler, a hardworking girl from a wealthy family (The Fowlers) with a long history of starting and managing powerful businesses. Marcy and Dez will be rivals driving each other to improve while managing monthly trials similar to \nThe Apprentice/ Shark Tank\n. \nLoose Change by Beyond Publishing Caribbean| Creative Caribbean \nA lot of Caribbean writing is about past or current struggles, but you've gone a different way. Why is that?\nAt Beyond, our mission is to show the Caribbean in ways that haven\u2019t been seen before. We took the opportunity to leverage the comic medium and current resources to tell stories that we were not seeing from the region or from overseas. This comes from a firm belief that we have more to offer in storytelling than what was currently out there. \nI also believe we are currently in a cultural war which we are losing. Many of our youth do not have the same reverence or appreciation for our legends and history as they do for the ones outside. When speaking to any young person, they can tell you what a vampire is. What are the rules of a samurai. Who the Monkey King is. Who is the Norse God of Thunder. But if you were to ask them what a Baku is. What are the forms of Stick-Licking? What is a Steel Donkey and the legend around it? They will draw a blank. This is something that we at Beyond seek to address with our stories, and we have approached this in multiple ways even with the same folklore base. \nIn \nOffset\n, I wanted to frame the stick-licker as a warrior just as iconic as the samurai through characters like Kyle Harding or Linseed Beckles. I wanted people to fear the Heart Man but also have empathy towards him as it relates to the world I created. I wanted reverence and awe when people view the Shaggy Bear, the Mocajambe and the Baku. This particular approach guides how I structure the narrative of the series. \nChallenging the view of the Caribbean\nOffset \nalso twists this idea of the Caribbean as just a place of leisure. There is beauty and magic here, along with darkness and violence. Balancing these elements within the unique version of Barbados in the story known as Bimshire, along with the rest of the region is one of the challenges for the series. \nIn \nLoose Change\n, I challenge a version of the Caribbean where we came together as one region, and built powerful industries that benefit our communities. I also challenge how we view wealth and the image of the wealthy. Media often frames wealth as Caucasian/ European even though in real life there any many successful entrepreneurs and executives who are diverse, many of which are in the Caribbean as well. \nI believe the problem of \u201cstruggle stories\u201d is that it reinforces the Caribbean and African diaspora as passive victims of an oppressor, or volatile -sometimes, wild criminals or criminal adjacent - people who are the architects of their own destruction. This is dangerous in that it affects how people outside the diaspora view and treat us, and worst of all, it limits the aspirations and ambitions of those from the diaspora that will come after us. \nThis is not to say that struggle stories are not important. \u201cThose that ignore history are doomed to repeat it.\u201d It is important to highlight and educate people on the atrocities that marginalised groups have faced, so that empathy can be created and possibly help prevent those same horrible events from happening again. However, our identity is more than pain and struggle. We can be warriors. We can be love interests. We can be leaders. We can be heroes. We can even be villains. Offering something different in the face of these portrayals will have net positive effects in the long term, and I, along with my colleagues at Beyond Publishing seek to add to this endeavour. \nWell, I hope this has whetted your appetite for part two, where Delvin gives more detail on why he set up Offset, the importance of Black stories and Caribbean stories, and his vision for the future in terms of anti-racism. Part two drops next week.\nIn the meantime, you can check out Delvin's work on the \nOffset Serie\ns and \nBeyond Publishing Caribbean\n websites, and on Instagram at \n@offsetcomic\n, \n@beyondpublishingcaribbean\n and \n@loosechangecomic\n.\nThanks for reading,\nSharon\n*Bimshire is a nickname for Barbados\nWhat did you think of today's article?\n\ud83d\udd25\ud83d\udd25\ud83d\udd25I loved it!\n \u00a0|\u00a0 \n\ud83d\udd25\ud83d\udd25I liked it\n \u00a0|\u00a0 \n\ud83d\udd25It was ok\nNote: poll feedback is private - if you\u2019re happy to share your thoughts in public, then please also \nleave a comment\n.\nLeave a comment \nThe Daily Newsletter for Intellectually Curious Readers\nJoin over 4 million Americans who start their day with \n1440\n \u2013 your daily digest for unbiased, fact-centric news.

Here\u2019s why the lunar eclipse this week is called the \n\u201cblood worm moon.\u201d\n As for the rest of the news, here\u2019s what you need to know today.\n\u00a0 \n1.\nThe Cook County Clerk\u2019s office announces new DEI initiatives\n\u00a0\nCook County Clerk Monica Gordon said yesterday that \u201cthreatening rhetoric and cruel policies\u201d from the federal government are creating uncertainty for marginalized communities and have led to a surge in requests for vital records.\nThrough the first two months of the year, there has been a 22% increase in requests for birth certificates compared with the same period in 2024, according to the clerk\u2019s office. Marriage and civil union license requests also have increased by 37% this year, my colleague Emmanuel Camarillo reports for the Sun-Times.\nGordon said part of the birth certificate requests increase is from immigrant families concerned about obtaining records that validate the citizenship of their children.

[\nChicago Sun-Times\n]\n2.\nA federal jury awards $120 million to 2 men falsely convicted in 2003 murder\n\u00a0\nTwo men who spent 16 years in prison for a murder they didn\u2019t commit were awarded $60 million each by a federal jury yesterday after a nearly five-year court battle, my colleague Violet Miller reports for the Sun-Times.\nThe settlement is one of the largest total awards for a wrongful conviction in U.S. history \u2014 larger than the $50 million awarded to Marcel Brown, a Chicago man who was wrongfully convicted in a murder and served 10 years.\nJohn Fulton and Anthony Mitchell, who were 17 and 18 when they were arrested in 2003, were each sentenced to 31 years in prison following their 2006 convictions for the murder of Christopher Collazo. No physical evidence or eyewitnesses tied either man to the crime.\n\u201cI would have preferred all the officers involved do 16 years in the state penitentiary and see what I had to go through, and have family members and friends to break away from you because they believed the accusations,\u201d Fulton said. \u201cOur celebration will be when all wrongfully incarcerated people can step foot in the free world.\u201d [\nChicago Sun-Times\n]\nSPONSOR MESSAGE FROM CHICAGO HUMANITIES FESTIVAL\nDelve Into What\u2019s Happening at Chicago Humanities\nJoin Chicago Humanities this spring for a series of social and engaging events with some of the biggest names in art, culture, and politics, including journalists Ezra Klein and Derek Thompson, David Rubenstein chats with Walter Isaacson, Suleika Jaouad with husband Jon Batiste, and actor and comedian Ed Helms.

The three lines terminating at Ogilvie Station have been operated by Union Pacific for years. But Metra said the freight line no longer wants to operate commuter trains, so Metra is taking over the job this spring.\nAs part of that transition, Metra said it wants to rename those lines, and possibly all others with new signs that could be completed as soon as 2029. It is seeking public feedback through an online survey found at \nmetra.com/LineNames\n.

The show features newly commissioned arrangements and orchestrations by Corgan and conductor James Lowe. Costumes for the show will come from House of Gilles, the fashion brand led by Corgan\u2019s wife, Chloe Mendel, and her father, Gilles Mendel.\nThe Corgan collaboration is part of the Lyric\u2019s ongoing efforts to expand the definition of opera and bring in new audience members, an initiative that\u2019s been spearheaded, in part, by the company\u2019s new leader, John Mangum. The show will run for seven nights, Nov. 21\u201330.

We have been put on this earth to engage people, to encourage each other and to help each other live a decent relative life.\u201d\nWhen asked what else she learned, 11-year-old Bri Randolph said, \u201cThat my mom was right.\u201d [\nWBEZ\n]\n\u00a0\nHere's what else is happening\n\u00a0\nFormer Philippine President Rodrigo Duterte was arrested in Manila Tuesday and is en route to face charges of crimes against humanity at the International Criminal Court in The Hague\n.

A pioneer in Chicago theater and a key player in rebooting the city\u2019s African American Arts Alliance (rebranded as Black Arts & Culture Alliance of Chicago in 2023), Taylor has left her mark on a generation of creatives in Chicago.\n\u201cYou have people that sneak in that are, like, famous.

I normally look forward to sending out my weekly newsletter, The Everyday Advocate, but I unexpectedly pushed pause on that for a bit. I'll be honest, things got pretty chaotic at the end of January, and I've been hard at work offline caring for myself and my team, fortifying our business, and getting ready for the treacherous landscape that's ahead for us in this work of diversity, equity, inclusion & belonging (scaaaary words, I know).\n\u00a0\nFirstly, allow me to reintroduce myself. I'm Dani, owner of Oh Happy Dani: a lifestyle brand and educational platform that exists to help everyday advocates seek justice & stay hopeful. There are quite a few new faces on my email list, which I'm thrilled about! Rest assured, my mission hasn't changed, and it won't be changing any time soon! Here's what's been going down since I've been away from this space:\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\nEver since my \nseries of announcements\n about pulling out of Target for the rollback of their DEI commitments, my legal team and I have been hard at work actually making that happen. There have been a lot of moving pieces, but we're on track for being out of there by the end of summer. I've done tons of interviews on this (and got my first \nNew York Times\n feature?!?) and one thing I've consistently said is that while this was a heavy decision, it wasn't a difficult one. You know those kinds of decisions: the right choice is clear, but the impact is significant.\u00a0\n\u00a0\nMy business is an outlet for my advocacy, not the other way around. If I have to choose between living out my values and making more money\u2026 the right choice is clear. Of course, not every business that's contractually tied to a corporation can make these choices as quickly or easily\u2013this is just my story and what's true for me. Since the decision, I've gotten questions like \u201cdoesn't this hurt your business?\u201d and \u201cwhat about future opportunities?\u201d\u00a0\n\u00a0\nMoni, \u00a0support from people like YOU has gotten my business to this point, and that support will continue to sustain us after this chapter is closed. See for yourself what happened after I shared the news about Target with you:\nI believe that what's for me is for me, and I put my trust in God, not corporations. You've shown up for me again and again, and we've come way too far to give up now.\n\u00a0\nFun secret fact: I told the NY Times reporter in our interview that y'all came through for me like this\u2026 they didn't believe me and left it out of the story. That's how shocking your support has been.\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\nAfter years of running lean, I'm finally back to growing a team and dreaming big for the future of Oh Happy Dani. In case you missed it, we're in Nashville now, and we're handling all product fulfillment in-house because I like to touch everything and am a perfectionist!!!\u00a0\n\u00a0\nOne of my favorite things I do every month is Freedom School, a monthly digital subscription providing high-quality, printable resources designed to teach, preserve, and celebrate Black history through illustrated guides, art prints, hands-on activities and more.\u00a0\n\u00a0\nThis month's theme is \u201cCan't Count Us Out: Black Women who Battled for the Ballot,\u201d and y'all, it is sooooo good. In honor of Women's History Month, It celebrates Black women who were often left out of the suffrage conversation and highlights their contributions to the struggle for women's voting rights. It's a great resource for families, classrooms, or individual learning with an illustrated twist!\n\u00a0\nFun secret fact: A new subscription is coming for physical products!! More info is on the way!\n\u00a0\nI'm looking forward to getting back into the swing of things, and the Everyday Advocate newsletter will be back next week. Until then, feel free to check out the shop to see what's new, follow along on social, or simply reply to this email and let me know how you're doing!\u00a0\n\u00a0\nThe landscape may be changing, but our resolve doesn't have to. I'm in it with you!\n\u00a0\nHappy you're here,\nDani \u263b\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n2817 West End Avenue, STE 126-285\nNashville, Tennessee 37203, United States\nUnsubscribe\n or \nManage Preferences\n here.

The recently announced deferred resignation program, introduced via an Office of Personnel Management (OPM) memo, offers federal employees a lucrative off-ramp: full pay and benefits until September 30, 2025, with exemption from in-person work requirements, and many put on administrative leave. \nMany will take this offer. Facing mounting uncertainty, a hostile workplace environment, and the erosion of once-ironclad civil service protections, thousands of employees will see this as their best\u2014or perhaps only\u2014chance to leave on their own terms before being pushed out under harsher conditions later. Those most likely to accept the offer? The most experienced, highly skilled federal employees who know their value and have private-sector options.\n The consequences of this mass departure will not be felt immediately. That\u2019s what makes this such a dangerous, slow-moving disaster.\nTo learn more, check out this \nblog\n.\nRead Blog\n \nPrefer video to text?

I will use the responses to inform my articles in \nHarvard Business Review\n, \nFortune\n, and \nEntrepreneur\n.\nYour Testimonials\nYou and others who gain value from Disaster Avoidance Experts \nservices\n and thought leadership occasionally share testimonials about your experience, such as the one below. You can read more testimonials \nhere\n.\n\"Dr. Gleb Tsipursky presented [to] senior executive leaders and practitioners from throughout the region. The audience was \nvery appreciative of the informative content and inspired by Dr. Gleb\u2019s engaging and dynamic speaking style. Everyone benefited from the real-life, useful 'takeaways' that they could implement into their own work life right away.\n The feedback was universally positive with many people commenting that they had received \ntremendous value in return for their time in attending the three-hour program.\n There have been several requests that Dr. Gleb be invited back again soon.\"\nDavid Cutri\n, Vice President Northwest Ohio ISACA Chapter, and Secretary Northwest Ohio IIA Chapter\nSchedule a Free Consultation\n \nWhat's Up With Me\nIt's been really hard to see the situation with my fatherland of Ukraine. Military assistance cut off, and even intelligence cut off. I'll be traveling to New York later this week to visit my parents for my mom's 75th birthday, and I feel ashamed in front of my dad, who is 84, and was born in Ukraine (my mom was born in Moldova). I anticipate\u00a0some hard conversations about how he's feeling about the country he immigrated to with my mom and me in 1991, after his homeland was freed from Russian domination. All this time, America served as a bastion of freedom and defense against tyranny, and my dad was proud to live here and taught me to be proud of America. What's happening right now feels like a betrayal, and the long-term consequences will be dire, with our allies around the world no longer being able to count on us and thus failing to support us when we need them. In fact, the only time the NATO alliance's self-defense clause was invoked involved the attack on the US on 9/11, when the US needed help in Afghanistan. What we're seeing is truly a slow-moving train wreck, of promises broken and allies betrayed.\nWould love to get your feedback on what you found most useful about this edition of the \u201cWise Decision Maker Guide\u201d - simply reply to this email.\nDecisively Yours,\nDr. Gleb\nDr. Gleb Tsipursky\nCEO of Disaster Avoidance Experts\nPS: Are we connected on LinkedIn?

    "subject": "Learn how to use logic to defeat unconscious bias",
    "body": "Did you know that logic is a powerful tool for defeating bias?\n\u200a\n \n\u200a\n\"Overcoming Bias: A Guide to Skilled Skepticism\"\n\u200a\nDon\u2019t you love being right? I sure do. I think that\u2019s one reason most of us are afflicted with what\u2019s called \u201cconfirmation bias\u201d \u2013 the pesky habit of noticing only the evidence that proves our previously held beliefs correct. In other words, we see what we expect to see.\n\u00a0\nThis is where our biases \u2013 our inflexible beliefs about categories of people \u2013 trick us into jumping to the wrong conclusions. Once we get it into our heads that members of particular groups \u201call\u201d \u2013 because they are members of that group \u2013 share a particular characteristic, our brain just can\u2019t resist proving that bias right.\n\u00a0\nTake for example what can happen when we encounter a new team member who uses a wheelchair. Unfortunately, there is a tendency for some of us who are fully-abled to reflexively assume that a person in that situation will require extra help to perform their duties. \n\u00a0\nThat assumption \u2013 that bias \u2013 in turn means that we fastidiously notice every time he or she does, in fact, ask for help and \u2013 conveniently for the confirmation we are seeking \u2013 we fail to spot the more numerous times when that same person is utterly self-sufficient.\n\u00a0\nNoticing only that which makes us feel right may be tempting, but it sure is a bad idea if we are to see the people around us for who they really are and what they have to bring to the workplace.\n\u00a0\nSo, here\u2019s a thought: What if we adopt and practice a far-more productive habit? Namely the habit of \"skilled skepticism\". What if, every time we make an assumption about what someone is like, we pause to weaken that conclusion by dissecting its logic? Specifically, we ask ourselves these two questions:\n\u00a0\nHave I ever encountered someone who uses a wheelchair whose need for extra help interfered with my performance in some way?\n\u00a0\nThis brings us to the reality that, sure, some people who use wheelchairs do require extra help. That\u2019s real. It\u2019s not, however, \u201call\u201d as our confirmation bias tricks us into believing.\u00a0And this brings us to the demonic nature of bias. \n\u00a0\nWhen we have even one experience with a member of a group that negatively impacts us in some way -- in this case \u201cinterferes with performance\"-- the brain seeks to protect us from repeating that experience by erroneously teaching us that all members of the group in question are equally apt to put us at that disadvantage. \n\u00a0\nSadly experiences like this can cause a bias to be born. By recalling that experience and recognizing that it is an \nisolated\n incident, it brings the event into perspective and, thereby, weakens its impact on our thinking. \n\u00a0\nHow many people who use wheelchairs do I \nactually know\n who are constantly asking for help?\n \n\u00a0\nThe key phrase here is \u201cactually know.\u201d This doesn\u2019t mean saw depicted on the web or heard a rumor about. It means having had significant ongoing contact with a situation in which help was regularly sought. The answer is overwhelmingly apt to be very few if any. That answer -- that insight -- has the power to cut through your bias, to weaken it, and allow the rational brain to take over. \n\u00a0\nSkilled scientism \u2013 it works. You\u2019ll be surprised at what you will learn \u2013 not only about your colleagues \u2013 but about yourself as well.\u00a0\n\u00a0\n \nVISIT OUR\u00a0WEBSITE\n \nCLIENTS AND TESTIMONIALS\n \nCONTACT US TODAY!\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\n \n \n\u200a\nSondra is Available for\u00a0\nVirtual Presentations\n\u00a0on How to Defeat Unconscious Bias\n \n \n \nMission and Purpose:\nSondra's purpose is to meet each client\u2019s individual goals by providing practical, immediately applicable tools for defeating unconscious bias.

Incorporating products like BuzziSpace Panels and Quiet Spaces Pods can further optimize sound management, creating a balanced and efficient workspace.\nLearn More\n \n \nWork Inspired\nWith over 75\u00a0years of rich BOS history, an incredible team of employee-owners, and a\u00a0commitment to guiding you through the complexity of a new workspace.

From misunderstanding revenue sources to mishandling personal and business finances, these mistakes can have significant consequences. In this guide, we highlight the ten most frequent errors encountered during the 8(a) certification process, providing clarity and insights to help you avoid these missteps and successfully position your business for growth and opportunity. Whether you\u2019re just starting or seeking to enhance your application, understanding these key points will empower you to make informed decisions and increase your chances of success.\n#1:\n Leaving their employer but still generating the majority of their revenue from that past employer. In reality, no more than 25% of your firm's revenue can come from your former employer.\n#2:\n Filing a tax return that shows no profit. It's common for accountants to utilize accelerated depreciation, leading the business to appear as having a loss.\n#3\n: Relying on a single client for all your business. No more than 70% of your firm's revenue can come from one source.\n#4:\n Transferring cash from the business to a personal checking account, which may lead to exceeding the net worth threshold.\n#5:\n Establishing a new company to conduct business with the government. This creates issues with control and dedication; the government prefers your 8(a) firm to be your primary business.\n#6:\n Overstating past legal troubles. Generally, if you have been off probation for five years, the SBA is unlikely to object to your application, provided the issues are fully disclosed.\n#7:\n Assuming that statistical disparities (e.g., minorities or women making less than men) suffice for your social disadvantage narrative. The SBA is more interested in the specific social disadvantages you have experienced.\n#8:\n Forming a joint venture prior to entering the 8(a) program. While small businesses are allowed to create joint ventures for small business work, doing so beforehand creates control issues. It's best to wait until after you've entered the 8(a) program to form a JV.\n#9:\n Putting the company in the name of a spouse who is not the primary operator of the business. If the 51% owner of the firm is not fully devoted to the business, the application may be rejected. Once in the 8(a) program, government buyers will want to meet the firm's owner, which can hinder marketing efforts.\n#10:\n Trying to conceal assets or failing to disclose an arrest to the SBA. They conduct credit checks and background investigations as part of the application process to uncover missing assets or integrity issues.\nSuccessfully navigating the 8(a) certification process requires careful attention to detail and a thorough understanding of the potential pitfalls. By being aware of the common mistakes outlined above, you can better prepare your business for a successful application and maximize your opportunities for growth and government contracts.\nIf you find yourself overwhelmed or unsure about the next steps in your 8(a) journey, EZ8A is here to help.

While Bianca is out, I\u2019ll be heading up your daily digest for the next few weeks. Feel free to drop a line with any thoughts about dogs or K-dramas. As for the rest of the news, here\u2019s what you need to know today. \n\u00a0 \n1.\nInfluential bishops with Chicago ties will have a hand in picking the next pope\n\u00a0\nCatholics worldwide have been following Pope Francis\u2019 health scare, which left him hospitalized with double pneumonia for weeks. The Vatican \noffered cautious optimism\n that the 88-year-old pontiff has recovered, but the institutions he leads are nonetheless preparing for what might come next, my colleague Lauren Fitzpatrick reports for the Sun-Times.\nAmong the men who will determine whether the Catholic church continues Francis\u2019 pastoral service for all or swing back to a conservative interpretation are three influential bishops tied to Chicago: Cardinal Blase Cupich, the archbishop of Chicago, and Chicago-born Cardinals Robert Prevost and Wilton Gregory, who would be part of the papal conclave that elects a new pope.\nOf the 137 cardinals eligible to vote for the next pope, 109 of them were appointed by Francis, who made a point to elevate bishops from underrepresented places and backgrounds. Despite the influence wielded by Chicagoans overall at the Vatican, the odds are long that one of them will succeed Francis on St. Peter\u2019s throne.\n\u201cThey\u2019ve all given very good service to the church,\u201d one local seminarian observed. \u201cBut I just think it would be very difficult to elect an American cardinal, especially at this time, with the church and with the fraught nature of the politics and of the person in our country who resides in the White House.\" [\nChicago Sun-Times\n]\n2.\nNew data breach exposes info for 700,000 CPS students\n\u00a0\nCleo, a file transfer software vendor used by Chicago Public Schools, was the subject of a cyberattack late last year in which student data was accessed and published to the dark web, CPS said in a statement.\nThe data breach affected roughly 700,000 students dating back to the 2017\u20132018 school year, CPS said. Students\u2019 names, dates of birth, genders and their CPS student ID numbers were accessed. Students enrolled in Medicaid also had their Medicaid ID number and dates of eligibility exposed.\nSocial Security numbers, financial data and health information were not exposed in the breach, the school district said.\n\u201cAt this time, there is no evidence to suggest that any student data has been misused. No staff information was involved in this incident,\u201d CPS said. [\nChicago Sun-Times\n]\nSPONSOR MESSAGE FROM MEDGLOBAL\nProviding Lifesaving Healthcare\nMedGlobal is a Chicago-based \nmedical charity\n that supports the most vulnerable in disaster regions providing maternal healthcare and malnutrition programs in Gaza, Sudan and Syria. Your Zakat in the month of Ramadan will provide healing. \nLearn how you can help.\n3.\nAs Medicaid cuts loom, patients and officials defend care for chronic pain, behavioral health and addiction\n\u00a0\nIdalys Montijo is one of the more than 770,000 Illinois residents \u2014 and 78 million Americans \u2014 who could lose their health care coverage if Congress passes $880 billion in Medicaid cuts. She has spent hours of her life doubled over with back pain so intense, it would make her vomit.\n\u201cI was able to survive because with my [current] insurance, I got covered,\u201d she told my colleague Violet Miller at the Sun-Times. \u201cI would choose to die before I went through that pain again.\u201d\n\u200b\u200bAs part of a bid to avoid a government shutdown in two weeks \u2014 and after ruling out cuts to Medicare and Social Security \u2014 congressional Republicans have set their sights on a potential $880 billion in cuts from Medicaid over the next decade to help finance $4.5 trillion in tax cuts.\nCurrent Illinois law would automatically end Affordable Care Act Medicaid expansions if federal funding is cut, significantly reducing who qualifies for the coverage. [\nChicago Sun-Times\n]\n4.\n\u2018Two pilots from Southwest saved the day,\u2019 aviation expert says about last month\u2019s close call at Midway\n\u00a0\nA couple of seconds and a pair of \u201cwell-trained\u201d pilots likely made the difference in saving lives and preventing catastrophe during \nlast month\u2019s near-collision\n between a Southwest Airlines jet and a business aircraft at Midway Airport, an aviation expert recently told the Sun-Times.\nAllied Pilots Association spokesperson Dennis Tajer\u2019s initial reaction upon seeing video of the incident was \u201cWow, that was close.\u201d\nThe Southwest 737 plane arriving Feb. 25 from Omaha, Nebraska, was in its final stage of descent about 8:50 a.m. and almost touched down on the runway when the pilot of a Flexjet business aircraft appeared to misunderstand an air traffic controller\u2019s instructions and crossed onto the runway in the Southwest flight\u2019s path. Fortunately, pilots train for uncertain scenarios like this.\n\u201cAre the winds a little bit squirrely? Is your left wing a little bit too low? Do you feel confident in being able to successfully execute that landing?\u201d one aviation professor said. \u201cIf you\u2019re ever in doubt, you can always initiate that go-around procedure and come back and try again.\u201d [\nChicago Sun-Times\n]\n5.\nOn Harriet Tubman Day, a new effort to place the abolitionist on the $20 bill launches\n\u00a0\nToday\u2019s announcement is the latest push to honor Tubman on the currency, following a decade of previous attempts, including legislation that has stalled in Congress. The announcement coincides with Harriet Tubman Day, which honors the woman who led enslaved people to freedom on the Underground Railroad.\nThe \"Harriet Tubman Tribute Act of 2025\" calls for the Treasury secretary to include the abolitionist's face on all $20 bills printed after Dec. 31, 2030, according to a draft of the bill obtained by NPR. Andrew Jackson, the country's seventh president and a slaveholder, would be removed from the $20 bill.\nThe proposed legislation also stipulates that production of these bills cannot be delayed more than two years, unless it is determined that issuing the bills after the designated date \"would create an unacceptable risk of counterfeiting or to the safe, secure, and speedy functioning of the United States economy.''

[\nNPR\n]\nU.S. immigration agents arrested a Columbia University protest organizer with permanent U.S. residency over the weekend, part of a crackdown against \u201cHamas supporters\u201d on which President Donald Trump campaigned. [\nReuters\n]\nEnglish Premier League soccer clubs, including Manchester United, West Ham United and Everton, will play a double-header at Soldier Field in July. [\nBlock Club Chicago\n]\nTesla facilities across the U.S. are facing protests and vandalism in response to the political role owner Elon Musk has played in the Trump administration. [\nBBC\n]\n\u00a0\nOh, and one more thing...\n\u00a0\nA structure that used to house what is now the Wilson Red Line stop could soon be a grocery store owned and operated by customers.\nUptown Station is a stunning relic of the 1920s, when getting around the city and suburbs by train was the norm and the neighborhood was a stylish place to be. But the building didn\u2019t look this good for its entire 102-year history. In fact, that arched top, the pediment, is a late 2010s recreation: There was an arch like this on the station when it opened in 1923, but it was chopped off in the 1950s.\nIn May 2018, CTA officials signed a lease with the Chicago Market, a grocery cooperative that, at the time, said it would take about 18 months to build out the space \u2014 meaning it would open sometime in 2020. Now, in 2025, Grant Kessler, the board\u2019s president, told my colleagues at WBEZ\u2019s Reset the establishment is \u201cworking hard to be open by the end of the year.\u201d [\nWBEZ\n]\n\u00a0\nTell me something good\n\u00a0\nChicago can expect temperatures approaching 70 degrees by the end of the week. The nice weather has most of us champing at the bit for the grown-up equivalent of having class outside, even if it \nfeels too early\n in the year. My hound and I will probably find a new-to-us dog park, and my colleagues are already trading gardening tips.

She gets a charitable tax deduction whenever she puts money, \nstocks\n, or other assets in the fund. Beth allocates a certain amount of money from her fund each year for her kids and grandkids to recommend grants consistent with her values. Her family now talks about philanthropy throughout the year, and they think about how they can make a difference for Israel and for their other favorite charities, as well.\nMore About DAF\n\u00a0\nShelly was worried that she would not have enough income in retirement.\n She decided to supplement her retirement income by funding a \nCharitable Gift Annuity\n with Jewish National Fund. She will receive income for life at payout rates which are the highest they have been in over 15 years. Her annuity income will be largely tax-free, and her charitable income tax deduction will be substantial.\u00a0\nMore About CGA\nShe can even fund a Charitable Gift Annuity using her \nIndividual Retirement Account (IRA)\n, satisfying her Required Minimum Distribution (RMD) while receiving income for life.\u00a0\nMore About IRA Charitable Rollover\n\u00a0\nAlice wanted to sell a vacation home that her family no longer uses.\n She bought the home 25 years ago and it is now worth four times what she paid for it. She will pay significant capital gains tax if she sells the home. Alice learned that she could use the home to fund a \nCharitable Remainder Trust\n that will provide her with decades of generous income, while avoiding capital gains tax. It was not complicated to set up this Trust, and Alice was thrilled to learn that she would be able to benefit Israel this way.\nMore About Charitable Remainder Trust\n\u00a0\nJudith is redoing her will and she wants to provide for her loved ones while \nleaving a legacy for Israel\n.\n She has some real estate, an IRA, a stock portfolio, \nlife insurance\n, and \nBitcoin\n.

When we were talking about a follow-up, we discussed Black joy, rest, resistance and community, so naturally my sister \nLisa Hurley\n had to be part of the conversation. \nIn this excerpt, we talk about abundance, our responsibility in these times and how we can view ourselves as part of a whole (with an analogy I'm pretty happy with). And we take a swipe at capitalism, too. Check out this excerpt from Sam's private podcast:\nSam\n: What you're describing is like abundance. We do have limited resources on a finite planet. But what is abundant is what we can give: our joy, how we love. And I think so many folks are afraid that if they give their pot will be empty, \nLisa\n: They're depleting themselves. \nSharon\n: That is not how it works. No, that is not how it works. \nLisa\n: Nature abhors a vacuum. As soon as you give, something is coming. \nSharon\n: The universe is abundant. And this is the thinking that is the antithesis of the capitalist mindset. Yes, once we realize that the universe is abundant, then that changes how we are able to show up. I'm not being unrealistic, right? We're still living in this capitalist hellscape. There are certain things that have to be done. Bills have to be paid. \nLisa\n: You gotta pay your bills. You gotta pay your bills. \nThank you for being on the free list for Sharon\u2019s Anti-Racism Newsletter. I can\u2019t do this work without the support of readers like you. But most of all, I rely on those of you who upgrade to premium subscriptions. You can find pricing options here: \nShow me how I can support SARN \nSharon\n: But still, given that, you know, there are ways that we can show up for people, there's support that we can give. You know, sometimes it's a repost, sometimes it's $10, sometimes it's an introduction. You know, there are things that we can do. We all have things that we can do. \nLisa\n: We all have things that we can do, contribute, give. All of us have something, all of us. Having money in the bank account and the abundance of the universe are two different things. You know, money is not the only wealth. \nSam\n: There are people who are very morally bankrupt and have a lot of money, \nSharon\n: They are sending rockets into space. They are deporting people. They are pulling up ladders and closing doors behind them. You know, they're doing all these kinds of things. And it is just, it's so inhumane. Really makes me sick. There is no need for anybody on the planet to be hungry. There is no need for anybody on the planet not to have shelter, right? \nLisa\n: Poverty actually does not need to exist. It really doesn't. I know that's beyond the scope of this show, but we're going to talk about all the things, right? But it really does not. \nAnd yes, Sharon, you're right. There are people you know, tangerine hued people among others, who have means, right? And just are using their means and privilege in the worst possible ways. \nBut there is an alternate approach possible, you know. And so my thing is, just like, look around in your circle, right? Start small. \nSharon\n: The scale is so large, and then they get worried about that. But you know, what can you do where you are? Who's the person living next door to you that you can help? Yeah, on your online social network that you can help? On your team, in your office, who's that person? \nWe change the world by taking action where we are. Every drop leads to a trickle leads to a flood, leads to a whatever. You know, it's like water is in drops, but water created the Grand Canyon, right? That was water. That was drops of water working together. We can be the drops. \nI hope you enjoyed that short excerpt. How does the idea of being one of the drops that leads to an anti-racist flood resonate with you?\nYou can listen to the \nfirst part of this conversation\n, about resilience, and support Sam\u2019s work on the \nroots of change podcast page\n.\nThanks for reading,\nSharon\nNote: poll feedback is private - if you\u2019re happy to share your thoughts in public, then please also \nleave a comment\n.\nWhat did you think of today's article?\n\ud83d\udd25\ud83d\udd25\ud83d\udd25I loved it!\n \u00a0|\u00a0 \n\ud83d\udd25\ud83d\udd25I liked it\n \u00a0|\u00a0 \n\ud83d\udd25It was ok\nLeave a comment \nI am an\u00a0anti-racism educator and activist, the author of \n\u201cI\u2019m Tired of Racism\u201d\n, and co-host of\u00a0\nThe Introvert Sisters podcast\n.\n\u00a9 Sharon Hurley Hall, 2025.

    "body": "\u200b\n\u200b\n\u200b\nHi there,\nWomen\u2019s leadership has always been at the heart of change. \nChallenging systems, building movements, and making space for voices that might otherwise go unheard. \nAnd yet, this work is far from over.\nLet\u2019s name what\u2019s happening: Women are feeling less and less called to the table. Our rights\u2014the very things we have fought for, the progress we have made\u2014are being threatened. We watched a woman dragged out of a town hall by men who refused to identify themselves. Women\u2019s reproductive rights are on the line.\nAnd I want to be honest with you\u2014\nI am angry.\nI am typically an optimist. I believe in progress, in the arc of change, in the possibility of a better future. But today, as a woman, I am mad. And I am ready to fight.\nBecause we don\u2019t back down.\nOn \nInternational Women\u2019s Day\n, I want to take a moment to celebrate the women who have shaped me, inspired me, and paved the way for so many of us. But I also want to say this:\nThis is not just a day of celebration. It is a call to action.\nWe Honor Women By Continuing the Fight\nWe fight for the women whose voices are ignored in rooms where decisions about them are being made.\nWe fight for the women who are being told that their safety, their autonomy, their choices are up for debate.\nWe fight for the women who are exhausted, who feel like they have been screaming into the void, who are wondering if anyone is still listening.\nI hear you. I see you. And I am standing with you.\nAs we mark this day, I invite you to reflect:\nWho are the women who have shaped your journey?\nWhat lessons have they passed on that you carry with you today?\nHow are we ensuring that progress isn\u2019t just a moment, but a movement?\nIf you feel called, I\u2019d love for you to share your thoughts with me. Who do you want to honor today? Reply to this email, or join me on \nLinkedIn\n where I\u2019ll be sharing more reflections throughout the day.\nContinuing the Conversation\nIf you\u2019re looking for a space to connect, we\u2019ll be hosting a \ncommunity call\n this month to continue the conversation on women\u2019s leadership, resilience, and the fight ahead. Stay tuned for details. I\u2019d love for you to be part of it.\nMore than ever, I believe in the power of women\u2019s voices. I believe in the power of your voice. And I am so grateful to be in this fight alongside you.\n\u200b\nIn solidarity,\n\u200b\nJennifer Brown\nCEO & Founder, \nJennifer Brown Speaks\n\u200b\nAuthor, \nInclusion\n, \nHow to Be an Inclusive Leader\n, and \nBeyond Diversity\n\u200b\nHost, \nThe Will To Change\n Podcast\n\u200b\nUnsubscribe\n | \nUpdate your profile\n | 113 Cherry St #92768, Seattle, WA 98104-2205",

Our rights\u2014the very things we have fought for, the progress we have made\u2014are being threatened. We watched a woman dragged out of a town hall by men who refused to identify themselves. Women\u2019s reproductive rights are on the line.\nAnd I want to be honest with you\u2014\nI am angry.\nI am typically an optimist. I believe in progress, in the arc of change, in the possibility of a better future. But today, as a woman, I am mad. And I am ready to fight.\nBecause we don\u2019t back down.\nOn \nInternational Women\u2019s Day\n, I want to take a moment to celebrate the women who have shaped me, inspired me, and paved the way for so many of us. But I also want to say this:\nThis is not just a day of celebration. It is a call to action.\nWe Honor Women By Continuing the Fight\nWe fight for the women whose voices are ignored in rooms where decisions about them are being made.\nWe fight for the women who are being told that their safety, their autonomy, their choices are up for debate.\nWe fight for the women who are exhausted, who feel like they have been screaming into the void, who are wondering if anyone is still listening.\nI hear you. I see you. And I am standing with you.\nAs we mark this day, I invite you to reflect:\nWho are the women who have shaped your journey?\nWhat lessons have they passed on that you carry with you today?\nHow are we ensuring that progress isn\u2019t just a moment, but a movement?\nIf you feel called, I\u2019d love for you to share your thoughts with me. Who do you want to honor today? Reply to this email, or join me on \nLinkedIn\n where I\u2019ll be sharing more reflections throughout the day.\nContinuing the Conversation\nIf you\u2019re looking for a space to connect, we\u2019ll be hosting a \ncommunity call\n this month to continue the conversation on women\u2019s leadership, resilience, and the fight ahead. Stay tuned for details. I\u2019d love for you to be part of it.\nMore than ever, I believe in the power of women\u2019s voices. I believe in the power of your voice. And I am so grateful to be in this fight alongside you.\n\u200b\nIn solidarity,\n\u200b\nJennifer Brown\nCEO & Founder, \nJennifer Brown Speaks\n\u200b\nAuthor, \nInclusion\n, \nHow to Be an Inclusive Leader\n, and \nBeyond Diversity\n\u200b\nHost, \nThe Will To Change\n Podcast\n\u200b\nUnsubscribe\n | \nUpdate your profile\n | 113 Cherry St #92768, Seattle, WA 98104-2205",

It\u2019s a call to continue moving forward, breaking barriers, and driving change for the better.\n\u00a0\nToday, we celebrate the women who lead, innovate, and pave the way for future generations. But we also acknowledge that our progress depends on the collective effort to invest in women.\u00a0\n\u00a0\nAt the heart of this progress is the \nripple effect\n\u2014investing in women doesn\u2019t just empower them; it sparks a \nbroader transformation that enhances performance, innovation, and organisational success for everyone.\n\u00a0\nWhen we support women\u2019s growth and leadership, we create positive momentum that extends beyond the individual, touching entire teams and entire companies. This ripple effect is one of the most powerful ways to drive inclusivity, and it\u2019s something we should continue to invest in, each and every day.\n\u00a0\nLet\u2019s continue to make strides towards a gender-equal world.\n\u00a0\nSCHEDULE TIME TO TALK\n \nLEARN MORE\n \nSymmetra Pty Ltd, Quay Quarter Towers, Level 2, 50 Bridge Street, Sydney, NSW 2000 Australia, hello@symmetraglobal.com \nUnsubscribe",

Heads up that I\u2019ll be traveling the next couple weeks. But don\u2019t worry \u2014 my colleagues will still bring you the newsletter. Here\u2019s what you need to know today.\n\u00a0 \n1.\nAmid Loop vacancies, Chicago\u2019s property tax burden is shifting to neighborhoods\n\u00a0\nThe pandemic left the heart of the Loop with vacant offices and stores as workers and customers stayed home and more people began working remotely. Then, citing the impact of that lost business, the owners of those vacant offices won huge tax breaks from Cook County officials.\nThe taxes paid by the once-bustling but now-struggling \nWater Tower Place\n, for instance, have plunged from $16 million annually to $6.8 million last year.\nBut the taxes are still needed to pay for government services and salaries. City Hall and other government agencies have been asking property owners to pay more overall.\nSince the onset of the pandemic, all but four of Chicago\u2019s 63 ZIP codes have seen increases in property tax billings, my colleague Tim Novak reports for the Chicago Sun-Times.\u00a0\nThe Near West Side, Logan Square and Bronzeville neighborhoods have been particularly hard hit, much of that as a result of new commercial and residential developments. [\nChicago Sun-Times\n]\n2.\nThe Small Business Administration is closing its Chicago office, citing \u2018sanctuary city\u2019 status\n\u00a0\nIn coming months, SBA regional offices in Chicago, Atlanta, Boston, Denver, New York City and Seattle \u201cwill be moved to less costly, more accessible locations that better serve the small business community and comply with federal immigration law,\u201d the agency said in a news release.\nThe closures punish cities that don\u2019t comply with the U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement\u2019s efforts to detain immigrants, as President Trump urges mass deportations and tighter borders, Amy Yee writes for the Chicago Sun-Times.\nThe move also comes the day after Mayor Brandon Johnson testified before the House Oversight and Government Reform committee over Chicago\u2019s sanctuary city policy, along with the mayors of New York, Boston and Denver.\nThe SBA does not issue financing to small businesses directly, as people typically apply for SBA-backed loans through participating banks and lenders. But advocates say closing the SBA\u2019s Chicago office harms small businesses that need support. [\nChicago Sun-Times\n]\nSPONSOR MESSAGE FROM LOYOLA UNIVERSITY CHICAGO\nPositively Impact People and the Planet\nClimate change has dire implications for the world's water resources\u2014worsening droughts and flooding imperil communities worldwide, while warmer waters harm aquatic ecosystems and damage fisheries. More than half the world's population faces water insecurity.\nLoyola University Chicago's 2025 Climate Change Conference will explore global, regional, and local strategies for developing just solutions to the emerging water crisis.\nRegister now!\n3.\nHazel Johnson launched an environmental movement in Chicago that President Donald Trump is trying to end\n\u00a0\nEnvironmental justice was born in Chicago, and Johnson is remembered as the movement\u2019s \u201cmother.\u201d But advocates say Trump is creating a new narrative to demonize programs and policies aimed at helping vulnerable communities, Brett Chase reports for the Chicago Sun-Times.\nTrump is cutting jobs at the Environmental Protection Agency, and he\u2019s all but eliminated the Office of Environmental Justice within the office, which grew sixfold under former President Joe Biden. Trump equates environmental justice to diversity, equity and inclusion programs, which he has disparaged and sought to end.\nHazel, who died at age 75, had said she worked for all vulnerable people plagued by toxic pollution. Her activism persuaded former President Bill Clinton to recognize environmental justice in an executive order, which Trump ended in January.\n\u201cWe\u2019ve been knocked down before,\u201d her daughter, Cheryl, told the Sun-Times. \u201cI\u2019m going to carry on to my last breath in my body, and I\u2019m going to continue to fight for the inequalities that happen in our neighborhoods.\u201d [\nChicago Sun-Times\n]\n4.\nHow to ease the time change when we \u2018spring forward\u2019 this weekend\n\u00a0\nClocks will \u201cspring forward\u201d as daylight saving time takes effect at 2 a.m. Sunday, jumping ahead by one hour. While the extra evening sunlight might be welcome, the lost hour of sleep can leave many feeling groggy and out of sync.\nClara Peek, an expert on circadian rhythms, says small changes \u2014 like shifting sleep and meal times \u2014 can make a big difference.\nHer tips include eating breakfast at a consistent time relative to when you wake up, and, on Sunday, getting outside in sunlight as soon as possible. [\nChicago Sun-Times\n]\n5.\nThe Shedd Aquarium announced the name of its beluga whale calf\n\u00a0\nThe newest member of the aquarium now has a name \u2014 Opus.\nThe animal care team suggested names for aquarium members to choose from, and more than 1,000 votes were cast.\nOpus means a musical composition or set of compositions usually numbered in the order of its issue, the Shedd said in a news release. The name is also a nod to the calf\u2019s dad, Beethoven, and the vocalizations beluga whales make. [\nChicago Sun-Times\n]\n\u00a0\nHere's what else is happening\n\u00a0\nPresident Trump is seeking a new nuclear deal with Iran. [\nAP\n]\nWalgreens agreed to be acquired by a private equity firm for almost $10 billion. [\nAP\n]\nInternational Women\u2019s Day is tomorrow. [\nAP\n]\nLady Gaga\u2019s new album, \nMayhem\n, was released today. [\nBillboard\n]\n\u00a0\nOh, and one more thing...\n\u00a0\nA new Field Museum exhibit features more than 180 works from artists spanning more than 20 countries in Africa, and the pieces are presented in the context of the continent\u2019s political and cultural history.\u00a0\nAfrica Fashion\n shares personal stories of designers, highlights their innovation, and demonstrates their global impact. A companion exhibition, \nConnecting Threads\n, features African fashions created by Chicago designers.\n\u201cThe show is about agency,\u201d said lead curator Christine Checinska, who also serves as the senior curator of African and diaspora textiles and fashion at the Victoria and Albert Museum. \u201cIt\u2019s about abundance. It\u2019s about unbounded creativity. And I want people to really catch a glimpse of the magnificence of African creativity when they come to the show.\u201d [\nChicago Sun-Times\n]\n\u00a0\nTell me something good\n\u00a0\nI\u2019ve got some long plane rides coming up and a stack of books ready to go, but I\u2019m curious, what are your favorite ways to pass the time on a long flight or car ride?\nJill writes:\n\u201cMy favorite way to pass the time on a long flight? Listening to podcasts of \nWait Wait Don\u2019t Tell Me!\n I look through the WWDTM archive for past broadcasts I had missed, then download them before heading out so there\u2019s no need to worry about dropped wi-fi connections. The only problem is keeping myself from laughing out loud while listening to them in-flight.\u201d\nSe\u00e1n writes:\n\u201cI tend to listen to podcasts or audiobooks on long car rides. They keep my mind off the length of the drive on a given day. As for flights: if there isn\u2019t an IFE system available I\u2019ll bring the last few issues of National Geographic or a book or two to read. Even on noise cancellation mode I find it\u2019s hard to hear audio through my AirPods on planes.\u201d\nStephen writes:\n\u201cIt always makes me sad seeing adults playing mindless games or watching mindless TV when they're on a flight. Read a book. Grow your intellect by borrowing someone else's brain. It\u2019s a great way to enjoy some alone time even when you're surrounded by strangers.\u201d\nAnd Deb writes:\n\u201cReading, then sleeping, then walking to the restroom, ordering a drink and snack, working a crossword puzzle, drawing what you see out of the window or profiles of those around you, ordering another drink, writing about your trip and other travel plans, returning to sleeping, an aisle walk to the galley, a stop in the restroom, returning to your seat to gather up your belongings, and voila! You are there!\u00a0\nP.S. If your seatmate is amenable, you can punctuate the previous with short chats.\u201d\nThanks for all the responses this week! I\u2019m sure some of the tips will be helpful during the multiple 10-plus-hour flights I have this month.\nThanks for reading and have a nice weekend!

    "subject": "THE STREETS CANNOT BE QUIET",
    "body": "Let's make a lot of NOISE! Organize a Protest Now!\n\u200a\n \nJOIN A PROTEST! \nCAN'T FIND ONE? \nDIY Protest!\n \nTHE STORY OF ONE PROTEST\nA few weeks ago I read a headline that shook me to the core. It said:\n\"Trump dismantles democracy and the streets are quiet.\"\nMy feet began to burn. They wanted to march. My arms wanted to hold a sign. My voice wanted to shout my rage. My brain screamed, \"The streets must be noisy! VERY, VERY noisy.\"\n \nSo I stood up at a Women's Democratic Club meeting and asked if there was a protest coming up. There \nwasn't one. \nSo I publicly, on-the-spot volunteered to host a protest. The room immediately zapped with excitement. In ten minutes we had decided when, where, how and why we would protest on President's Day in Sarasota.\nSIX days later,\n we held the BIGGEST protest in Sarasota's history. It was all bottled up inside. The anger, the humiliation, the disbelief, the fear. 2,000 people showed up with almost no notice and protested for three hours along Route 41, with cars honking continuously in support.\nWe brought homemade signs that were clever, earnest, big, small -- a walking museum of originality and passion. The park filled with young and old, families and neighbors, gay, trans and straight, glamorous and casual. Some people carpooled over an hour to get there. We made new friends and bumped into old ones.\n \n \n \n \n \nWHY WE PROTEST\n\"Protesting is like a muscle,\" said Julie Forestier, President of the Sarasota Democratic Women's Club. \nIf you protest regularly, people learn how to do it. They start to expect it. And whenever big and bad things happens, we will be ready. When we hear a national group call for protest, our town, our group will take up the task. We will be organized. We will know how to get a lot of people into the streets!\nProtesting Gives People Hope\nWe are not alone in our outrage about the destruction of our country. We are able to find each other at the protest. We give each other energy that is otherwise bottled up inside, looking for an outlet. We learn how others express their thoughts. We hone our talking points. We feel engaged and attached, rather than isolated and surrounded. \nWe Bolster Our Self-Confidence\nAnd we are going to need it. \n \nAttention is Paid\nIf the streets are quiet, assumptions are made. No one sees our hand wringing and gnashing of teeth. They do see our protests, big or small. And they string them together in news reports. \nRachel Maddow \nhas been showing clips of protests in all corners of our country on her show. It is impressive, and meaningful. \nWe can move fast, and react to events\nPrivate citizens can say and do things that the elected officials usually cannot. We can hold a sign that says \"Trump Is a Russian Asset.\" An elected most likely can't. But we can. We can go full throttle, full throated in protest against the lies, the destruction, the chaos and the loss. And we must.\n \n \n \n \n \nACTIVATE YOUR COMMUNITY: \nTEN EASY STEPS TO CREATE A \nDO-IT-YOURSELF PROTEST\nI didn't know you could start your own protest in your community, town or state, but apparently you can...because I did it. Who knew?\nDon't wait for someone else to organize a protest, rally or march. Here's a Do-It-Yourself Kit for making it happen!\nStep One\n: Go to \nwww.mobilize.us\n to see if there are any protests near you. If the answer is YES, GO to that protest and get involved with the group hosting it.\n \nStep Two\n: If the answer is NO, volunteer to host it yourself. Find out where protests are usually held in your town. Look for a group or groups to work with. I suggest organizations like these:\nLocal Democratic Women's Club\nLocal Democratic HQ\nLocal Democratic Caucuses\nIndivisible group\nWomen's March online (get on their mailing list)\nMarch for Our Lives\n50501\nStep Three:\n TELL one of the groups that you are planning a protest and you want to work with them. Run the details by them to see if they agree this would be a good time, place and theme. They may know a lot more than you about protesting in your town, and that's great. Find what will work.\nStep Four\n: Ask the group to broadcast the news of the protest to any groups they know. Make sure someone with administrative rights puts the news on \nwww.mobilize.us\n. Word spreads fast.\nStep Five: \nContact the police station in your community to tell them you are going to have a sign-waving rally. Tell them you are the individual organizer and that you're working with several groups. Ask for a number you can call if you need to speak to someone during the protest, and give them your number. It's good for the police to have advance notice so that they can be ready if Trumpers come by.\nStep Six\n: Know your rights and the rules. \nThe ACLU recently published a brief summary of your protest rights\n.\nYou can hold a rally in any public park or space\nYou do not need a permit if you are marching on public streets or sidewalks, as long as you don't obstruct car or pedestrian traffic\nBe sure you are not on private property\nThe police are in charge of your safety and their number one rule is \"Don't stand in the street, even to take pictures.\"\n \nStep Seven\n: Scope out the protest location. Walk around and think of issues that might arise. Where will people park (most commonly asked question)? Is there shade? If people have wheelchairs or canes will they be safe on the terrain?\nStep Eight\n: Do you want to have speeches? With a good bullhorn you can make speeches almost anywhere. Bullhorns are great for chants as well -- but in some places, sound equipment at a large rally does require a permit, so find out. Make sure your have volunteers who want to speak or lead chants. You don't have to have speeches. And you don't have to march. Standing on a busy sidewalk with 100 people where cars can see you is a good rally.\nStep Nine:\n On the day of the event, be available to anyone who might need you. Ask other organizers to be ready to answer questions or show people where to stand.\nStep Ten:\n Estimate the number of people and start telling everyone right away if you are happy with the number. When people leave they will go home and say \"There were 500 people there!\"\n \n \n \n \n \nTHIS SATURDAY: JOIN THE INTERNATIONAL WOMEN'S DAY \n\ufeff\nOF ACTION IN SARASOTA, FL\n \n \n \n100 Days for Harris | \n96 Knauth Rd\n | \nAsheville, NC 28805 US\nUnsubscribe\n | \nUpdate Profile\n | \nConstant Contact Data Notice",

The initial amount funded at origination will be based on a fixed rate; however, this product contains an additional draw feature. As the borrower repays the balance on the line, the borrower may make additional draws during the draw period. If the borrower elects to make an additional draw, the interest rate for that draw will be set as of the date of the draw and will be based on an Index, which is the Prime Rate published in the Wall Street Journal for the calendar month preceding the date of the additional draw, plus a fixed margin. Accordingly, the fixed rate for any additional draw may be higher than the fixed rate for the initial draw. This product is currently not offered in the states of New York, Kentucky, West Virginia, Delaware and Maryland. The HELOC requires you to pledge your home as collateral, and you could lose your home if you fail to repay. Borrowers must meet minimum lender requirements in order to be eligible for financing. Available for primary, second homes and investment properties only. Dependent on minimum credit score and debt-to-income requirements. Occupancy status, lien position and credit score are all factors to determine your rate and max available loan amount. Not all applicants will be approved. Applicants subject to credit and underwriting approval. Contact Rate for more information and to discuss your individual circumstances. Restrictions Apply.\n\u00a0\n2- Savings, if any, vary based on the consumer's credit profile, interest rate availability, and other factors. Contact Rate for current rates. Restrictions apply.\n\u00a0\n3- Source: MortgageCalculator.org \"\n \nHome Equity Debt Consolidation Loan Calculator\n\"; Comparison of credit card debt with a 25.72% interest rate and a balance of $25,000 to a HELOC with a 15-year repayment\u00a0 term, $25,000 loan amount and interest rate of 6.95%. Average credit card interest rate is 24.72% (\n \nForbes\n\u202f) vs. our HELOC starts at 6.95% (subject to change) \u2013 which is 72% lower.\u00a0\n\u00a0\n4- Representative example of repayment terms for a Rate HELOC: For $25,000 borrowed over 180 months (15-year-term) at 7.95% APR (including 0.25% autopay discount), the monthly payment is $2xx. This example is an estimate only and assumes all payments are made on time. Specific repayment terms may vary based on borrower FICO score and CLTV.\n\u00a0\n5- Applications may be completed in five minutes but may fluctuate. Five business day funding timeline assumes closing the loan with our remote online notary. Funding timelines may be longer for loans secured by properties located in counties that do not permit recording of e-signatures or that otherwise require an in-person closing. In addition, funding timelines may be longer if we cannot readily verify that your property is in at least average condition with no adverse external factors with a property condition report and may need to order a desktop appraisal to confirm the value of your property. Texas borrowers will have a 12-day cooling period prior to closing on their home equity loan which will begin after the borrower has both filed a loan application and received consumer disclosures.\u00a0\n\u00a0\nOperating as Guaranteed Rate, Inc. in New York.\n\u200a\n| \u00a9 Guaranteed Rate, Inc. dba Rate | 3941 N.

    "body": "Plus, the current state flag overwhelmingly won a redesign contest. Here\u2019s what you need to know today.\n \n.\nTo view this email as a web page, click \nhere.\nWBEZ is a community-supported, nonprofit newsroom.\n \n\u00a0\nBecome a Member\nThursday - March 6, 2025\nToday's \nRundown\n is brought to you by WBEZ members and\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\nby Bianca Cseke\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\nGood afternoon! The city has released the \ndates\n for farmers markets, Taste of Chicago and other summer staples. Here\u2019s what else you need to know today.\n\u00a0 \n1.\nAccused teen serial killer Antonio Reyes allegedly murdered total strangers and close friends\n\u00a0\nProsecutors say suspected serial killer Antonio Reyes chose victims at random: a father with his children, shopping for a puppy; a young UPS driver waiting to pick up a friend; a man on his way to a gas station.\nBut Reyes\u2019 friends were also among his targets, according to the mother of one of his alleged victims and records in a related case.\nAs my Chicago Sun-Times colleagues Andy Grimm and Rosemary Sobol report, Reyes is suspected of asking two friends to kill a witness against him, a hit he allegedly ordered while in juvenile detention.\nReyes was arrested in 2020 in connection to a murder and a shooting, but police considered him a suspect in several murders \u2014 all committed over a nine-month span when he was 16 or 17.\nDuring the next four years, police said they built up other cases \u2014 through ballistics and social media messages \u2014 and charged Reyes with five more killings. [\nChicago Sun-Times\n]\n2.\nPresident Donald Trump\u2019s funding cuts are hitting early-career researchers the hardest\n\u00a0\nThe attempted cuts from the Trump administration are hitting UIC researchers who are just starting their careers especially hard.\u00a0\nThey are unsure of whether or not federal grants, a key source of funding for public health research, will exist to support their work, my colleague Lisa Kurian Philip reports for WBEZ.\nAlthough a court has temporarily blocked the administration\u2019s drastic cuts to funding for research institutions, the flow of grants from federal agencies like the National Institutes of Health and the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention has slowed to a trickle.\nThe administration has particularly focused on defunding research in any way related to diversity, equity and inclusion, which some scientists and health researchers say has become integral to an increasing number of federal grants.\nThe uncertainty has made budgeting for individual researchers and institutions very difficult. Some universities have paused graduate school admissions or taken down job postings because they don\u2019t know if they will have funding to take on new students or researchers, including graduate assistants. [\nWBEZ\n]\nSPONSOR MESSAGE FROM LOYOLA UNIVERSITY CHICAGO\nWhat\u2019s Your Calling?\nAt Loyola University Chicago, we are called. Called to lead on a global stage, to innovate with purpose, to reimagine the possibilities of tomorrow.\nWe believe quality education, accessible to all, is a powerful force for good. We're honored our commitment to educational excellence is \nnationally recognized.\nWe make an impact, today. That's why experiential learning, community engagement, and meaningful research are core parts of a Loyola education.\nLearn more at \nluc.edu/called.\n3.\nThe current Illinois state flag overwhelmingly won a redesign contest\n\u00a0\nIllinoisans have spoken, and they prefer the current flag over any of the other options presented to them, Kaitlin Washburn reports for the Chicago Sun-Times.\nThe public had a chance to vote for a new design from one of 12 choices or keep the current one. After five weeks of voting, the current flag won \u2014 by a lot.\nOf the nearly 385,000 votes cast, more than 165,000 went to the current flag \u2014 receiving more than the next five top designs combined. Second place earned 32,898 votes, Illinois Secretary of State Alexi Giannoulias announced today.\n\u201cSome may call it an SOB \u2014 a seal on a bedsheet \u2014 and the vexillological community may hate it, but people overwhelmingly prefer our current state flag,\u201d Giannoulias said in a statement. \u201cThank you to everyone who made their voice heard on the future of this important symbol of state pride.\u201d [\nChicago Sun-Times\n]\n4.\nOpioid and other drug overdose deaths in Illinois dropped for the first time since 2018\n\u00a0\nThe state recorded an 8.3% decrease in overall drug overdose deaths in 2023, exceeding a nationwide decline of 4%, according to the Illinois Department of Public Health. Opioid overdose deaths dropped 9.7%, compared to 3% nationally.\nOfficials said they think increased naloxone distribution throughout the state, community outreach through harm reduction organizations and drug overdose prevention programs, the availability of fentanyl test strips, and improved access to treatment and medication-assisted recovery have contributed to the decrease in deaths.\nA pilot program between the Illinois Department of Human Services and the Illinois State Police that began in 2020 is also allowing state troopers to connect those charged with drug crimes with case managers. [\nChicago Sun-Times\n]\n5.\nA new Uber Shuttle service will offer fans leaving the United Center $5 rides\n\u00a0\nGetting away from post-event chaos at the arena just got a little easier, Cindy Hernandez reports for the Chicago Sun-Times.\nInstead of waiting to find a ride, riders will be able to reserve a seat on a shuttle using the Uber app up to two days before an event, a spokesperson said. Riders can book up to four seats at a time.\nFans can board the shuttle at the Uber Zone, located in Lot E, at their designated time.\nThe buses, which seat up to 23 passengers, will ferry passengers to the Magnificent Mile, Ogilvie Transportation Center, Union Station and Old Town \u2014 though routes may change. [\nChicago Sun-Times\n]\n\u00a0\nHere's what else is happening\n\u00a0\nPresident Trump delayed some tariffs on goods from Mexico and Canada for four weeks amid economic fears. [\nAP\n]\nThe number of Americans filing for jobless benefits fell last week, according to the Labor Department. [\nAP\n]\nEuropean Union leaders held emergency Ukraine talks after Trump suspended U.S. aid. [\nAP\n]\nA WBEZ reporter got a look behind the scenes at Chicago Mayor Brandon Johnson\u2019s congressional grilling. [\nWBEZ\n]\n\u00a0\nOh, and one more thing...\n\u00a0\nChicago musician and activist Ric Wilson\u2019s is inspired by \u201cthe cool culture\u201d of South London and the \u201cover-the-top\u201d fashion of East London, though he told my Vocalo colleagues he doesn\u2019t have a set style.\u00a0\nInstead, he takes inspiration from different people he\u2019s encountered across eras of his life, whether channeling style elements of the artist Jean-Michel Basquiat or inheriting heirlooms from close friends.\nWilson stopped by Vocalo\u2019s studios to talk about his secrets for a tour wardrobe, honing his style and his time spent in London. You can listen and read highlights of the interview in the link. [\nVocalo\n]\n\u00a0\nTell me something good\n\u00a0\nI\u2019ve got some long plane rides coming up and a stack of books ready to go, but I\u2019m curious, what are your favorite ways to pass the time on a long flight or car ride?\nKelly writes:\n\u201cMy husband is Australian, and we are very familiar with long plane rides. Now that my kids are old enough to entertain themselves I can do my own stuff, and while most of it is typical phone games and movies, one really cool thing I found is a reverse coloring book. I don't have the desire to bring a bunch of stuff for a regular adult coloring situation, but with this, I just need two black pens, one thick, one thin, and a white gel pen and I'm set. It\u2019s SO relaxing and lovely.\u201d\nBecky writes:\n\u201cMy daughter gave me a cross stitch kit for Christmas, embarrassingly 2023. I\u2019m still working on it. The good news is long plane rides have time and good light for such an activity.\u201d\nFeel free to email me, and your response may be included in the newsletter this week.\nThanks for reading and have a nice night! I'll see you tomorrow.\n\u2014 Bianca Cseke\nThe Rundown is reader-funded.\u00a0\nYour gift of any amount helps power this newsletter and all of WBEZ\u2019s reporting.\u00a0\nDONATE TODAY\n\u00a9Chicago Public Media Inc 848 East Grand Ave, Navy Pier Chicago, IL 60611\nUnsubscribe\u00a0from The Daily Rundown\n\u00a0| \nPrivacy Policy",

    "body": "Public media is facing a critical challenge\n \nTo view this email as a web page, click \nhere.\n \n\u00a0\nDONATE\n \nMonica\u2014\nPublic media\u2019s vital role in our nation is being questioned, and the funding that supports WBEZ and other stations is at risk.\nFor nearly 82 years, WBEZ has been Chicago\u2019s trusted source for independent, fact-based journalism, education and emergency information. Founded in 1943 as one of the city\u2019s first FM stations, WBEZ was established to bring the Chicago Public Schools\u2019 curriculum into classrooms and homes long before remote learning was common. This commitment to public service continues thanks to your support and that of your fellow Chicagoans.\nThe Threat to Public Media\nPublic media strengthens civic life by delivering fact-based journalism, education and emergency information. As misinformation spreads and public trust declines, strong public media systems help foster informed discussion and civic engagement \u2014 while weakened ones leave communities more vulnerable to division and disinformation.\nNow, \npublic media faces a critical challenge.\n With federal funding for the Corporation for Public Broadcasting (CPB) set to expire on March 14, Congress will soon decide its future. Cuts would impact stations like WBEZ and the communities that rely on us.\nEach year, the CPB distributes about $1.60 of federal funding per American taxpayer to over 1,500 local public radio and TV stations, totaling $535 million (only 0.01% of the federal budget). By contrast, the UK invests nearly $100 per person in the BBC. \nCutting CPB funding would dismantle a crucial system that reaches 99% of Americans with trusted programming and journalism\n.\nAt Chicago Public Media, federal funding is 6% of our budget. Thanks to our members, foundations and sponsors, we have strong community support, but losing even 6% of this funding would affect our ability to serve you and our Chicago community.\nWhat\u2019s at Stake?\nDefunding public media means:\nLocal stations, especially in rural areas, could be forced to close.\nCommunities would lose access to trusted journalism.\nIn times of crisis, vital educational programming and emergency alerts would be at serious risk.\nPublic media has historically had bipartisan support, but now its future hinges on Congress. Your voice matters. Chicago has always valued independent journalism and public service \u2014 we need your help again to let Congress know why they need to protect public media.\nIn recent weeks, the new administration has taken additional steps that threaten public media. The Federal Communications Commission (FCC), which regulates communications by radio, television, wire, satellite and cable, has launched an investigation into NPR\u2019s underwriting program. NPR CEO Katherine Maher has been called to testify before a congressional subcommittee on Wednesday, March 26. Meanwhile, the Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE) has accused public media of producing \u201csystematically biased content.\u201d These efforts to discredit public media threaten our ability to inform and serve the public.\nTake Action:\nSpread the word: Tell friends and family why WBEZ and public media matter.\nLet your voice be heard and \nshare your thoughts online by leaving a comment\n.\nShare your story of what public media means to you on Instagram and tag @wbezchicago.\nContact your representatives and urge them to support public media funding.\nVisit \nProtectMyPublicMedia.org\n to send a letter to your representatives in seconds and for additional resources.\nYour support will help keep public media strong, independent, and accessible for generations to come.\nSincerely,\nMelissa Bell\nCEO and proud WBEZ supporter\u00a0\nPronouns: She / Her\nMatching Gifts\nCar Donation\nGift of Securities\nPlanned Giving\n\u00a9Chicago Public Media Inc 848 East Grand Ave, Navy Pier Chicago, IL 60611 \nUnsubscribe from WBEZ Membership emails\nPlease do not reply to this email.

The smartest startups know that keeping their workers happy is good for both the employees and the overall health of the business.\nFor its sixth annual list of \nAmerica\u2019s Best Startup Employers\n, \nForbes\n partnered with market research firm Statista to identify and assess 3,000 privately-held U.S. companies. In order to qualify, startups needed to employ more than 50 people, to have been founded between 2015 and 2022, and to be an independent company as opposed to a spinoff of a larger corporation. \nThen, each startup was evaluated in three primary areas:\n company reputation, employee satisfaction and growth.\nAt the top of this year\u2019s rankings are \nsome of the buzziest Generative AI companies of the moment\n, which collectively received $56 billion in venture capital in 2024. \nLanding at No. 7 is Anthropic\n, the creator of AI-assistant Claude\u2014similar to OpenAI\u2019s ChatGPT. Anthropic earned its strong employee ranking through robust paid leave programs, relocation support, competitive salary and equity packages, a monthly wellness stipend and extensive mental health resources, says Hannah Pritchett, the startup\u2019s head of people.\nBut companies create positive workplace cultures in a variety of ways. \nTake Mill, a startup with a mission to reduce food\n waste that punched its way up to the No. 11 spot in the ranking. Mill puts its product\u2014a sleek food recycler\u2014at the center of many company interactions. The devices can be found across a number of shared company spaces, packed with rotting eggs and other smelly food scraps, in order to field-test product designs and understand consumer pain points.\nSure, it might not always lead to the most fragrant office space, \nbut this practice has helped with employee bonding\n. \u201cWe really bring everyone in the company along for that journey,\u201d says Emma Bright, Mill\u2019s head of product design and engineering, adding that such an in-your-nose experience allows employees to solve problems while not taking themselves too seriously.\nRead more about some of the startups that made the list in contributor Haniya Rae\u2019s enlightening story \nhere\n, as well as the full ranking of America\u2019s Best Startup Employers 2025 from Rachel Rabkin Peachman \nhere\n.

With 12,000 small businesses holding GSA Schedules, it's clear that they play a significant role in federal procurement.\nOne of the key factors contributing to the success of small businesses with GSA Schedules is the rigorous vetting process conducted by the GSA. This process ensures that the products and services listed on the GSA Schedule meet the required standards, positioning small businesses on an equal playing field with larger vendors in the eyes of federal buyers.\nFurthermore, the wide range of products and services available on a GSA Schedule - over 12 million - provides federal buyers a one-stop shop for their procurement needs. This breadth of offerings not only enhances accessibility but also provides a wide variety that enables small businesses to carve out a share of the federal market and drive substantial sales within their industry.\nHere are some examples of the products on the GSA Schedule System.\nIT\nProfessional Services\nIndustrial Products & Services\nTransportation\nTravel\nHuman Capital\nOffice Management\nFurniture\nFacilities\nScientific Management\nSecurity\nMiscellaneous\nListed below are the GSA Industries ranked in order of size from largest industry to smallest.\nIf your industry appears on the list and you see potential for your business growth, we welcome you to contact us for a consultation. Our team is ready to assist you in exploring the benefits of obtaining a GSA Schedule, guiding you through the process, and assessing how it aligns with your business goals.\n\u00a0\nEmily Hatchel\n859-360-0909\nwww.advancegsa.com\nQuestions?\n Contact us today 1-859-360-0909\nAdvance GSA\n10500 Norbotten Dr\nFlorence Kentucky 41042\nUnited States \nYou are subscribed to this email as monica@lcwmail.com.\nClick here to modify your \npreferences\n or \nunsubscribe\n.",

    "body": "Tactics to overcome recency bias.\n \n \nHi\u00a0Monica,\nThink about your most important project.\nWho\u2019s the first person you\u2019d go to for input?\nWas one of the first people you thought of, one of the last people that you've heard from or seen?\u00a0\nYes or no?\nChances are, you answered yes.\nIt's probably\u00a0someone you\u2019ve seen or heard from recently...\n...But is that the \nbest\n person to go to?\nThe Bias at Play\nOur brains rely on mental shortcuts, but those shortcuts can sometimes work against us\u2014\nespecially in geographically distributed, hybrid and remote teams.\nTwo unconscious biases could be shaping your decisions without you even realizing it:\n\ud83d\udd39 \nRecency Bias\n \u2013 We prioritize what\u2019s \nrecent\n over what\u2019s \nrelevant\n.\n\ud83d\udd39 \nDistance Bias\n \u2013 We favor people \nphysically closer\n to us, even if they\u2019re not the best fit for the task.\nWhy This Matters\nWhen we let these biases drive our decisions, we risk:\n\u274c Overlooking key collaborators who aren\u2019t top of mind.\n\u274c Missing out on the right expertise.\nHow to Combat These Biases\nHere are three simple tactics we teach as part of our training programs to help mitigate these biases and build even more effective distributed teams:\n\u00a0\n\u2705 \nPause & Ponder\n \u2013 Before moving forward, ask yourself: \nAm I reaching out to the right person - or just the most recent one?\n\u00a0\n\u2705 \nCreate a Visual Cue\n \u2013 Post\u00a0a team photo\u00a0or org chart\u00a0at your workstation. A small visual reminder can help you expand your mental network.\n\u2705 \nBuild Virtual Watercoolers\n \u2013 Use Slack, Teams, or other collaboration tools to create informal spaces for connection beyond your immediate circle.\nThe Takeaway\nDon\u2019t default to who\u2019s closest or who you heard from most recently - choose who\u2019s best.\nThis small shift can transform your, and your team\u2019s, effectiveness.\nWant to learn more about\u00a0how our training programs\u00a0can empower your geographically distributed,\u00a0hybrid,\u00a0and remote teams with the skills to work more effectively together across distance?\nReply to this email,\u00a0or\nSchedule 30 minutes\n\u00a0with me\nSacha Connor\nCEO, Virtual Work Insider\n\u00a0 \n \n \nCopyright \u00a92025 Virtual Work Insider, All rights reserved.\nWant to change how you receive these emails?\nYou can \nupdate your preferences\n or \nunsubscribe from this list\n. \n\u2007\ufeff\u034f \u2007\ufeff\u034f \u2007\ufeff\u034f \u2007\ufeff\u034f\u2007\ufeff\u034f \u2007\ufeff\u034f \u2007\ufeff\u034f \u2007\ufeff\u034f\u2007\ufeff\u034f \u2007\ufeff\u034f \u2007\ufeff\u034f \u2007\ufeff\u034f\u2007\ufeff\u034f \u2007\ufeff\u034f \u2007\ufeff\u034f \u2007\ufeff\u034f\u2007\ufeff\u034f \u2007\ufeff\u034f \u2007\ufeff\u034f \u2007\ufeff\u034f\u2007\ufeff\u034f \u2007\ufeff\u034f \u2007\ufeff\u034f \u2007\ufeff\u034f",

For example, for a single purchase of $5,000, you will earn an extra 2,500 miles. Basic Card Members will earn 1.5X on a maximum of $100,000 in eligible purchases associated with this benefit per calendar year per Card Account. If your eligible purchase qualifies for a category that has an equal or higher mileage accelerator, only one accelerator will apply (if the mileage accelerator rates vary by category, then higher accelerator will apply). For example, a single Delta purchase or a single Hotel purchase of $5,000 or more will earn two additional miles per dollar instead of an additional one-half mile per dollar. Eligible transit purchases include purchases with train, taxicab, ride share service, ferry, toll, parking, bus, and subway merchants. Purchases of airfare, car rental and cruises are not considered eligible transit purchases. Eligible shipping purchases must be made at courier, postal, and freight shippers located in the U.S. Eligible shipping purchases do not include shipping costs added to retail purchases or moving services.\nBasic Card Members will not earn the extra miles associated with this benefit if American Express does not receive information that identifies your purchase as eligible for the benefit. For example, a purchase of $5,000 or more will not qualify if the merchant divides the entire transaction into two or more purchases of less than $5,000 before providing the information to American Express. Retailers, aggregators, and online marketplaces are a few examples of merchants that may divide transactions into smaller purchases. Purchases may be divided by date of availability, shipping date, ticket, or reservation, among other things.\n3X Miles at Hotels: \nBasic Card Members will earn 2 additional miles (for a total of 3 miles) for each dollar of eligible purchases charged on their Card or any Additional Cards on the Card Account directly with hotels worldwide. Basic Card Members will earn additional miles when you pay the hotel directly (e.g. upon check-in or check-out) for a hotel stay that was reserved with a third party, such as an online travel agent. Basic Card Members will not earn additional miles if you prepay for your hotel with a third party, such as an online travel agent, or prepay the hotel as a part of a vacation package. Basic Card Members may not get additional miles for purchases at establishments located inside hotels such as timeshares, spas, restaurants, meeting rooms, event spaces, and banquet halls. Basic Card Members may earn additional miles for incidental charges made directly on the hotel property (including charges made at restaurants, spas, and other establishments), when purchases are charged to their room and paid for with their Card at checkout.\n3X Miles on Delta Purchases:\n Basic Card Members will earn 2 additional miles (for a total of 3 miles) on each dollar of eligible purchases on their Card or any Additional Cards on the Card Account charged directly with Delta where Delta is the merchant of record, such as purchases via \ndelta.com\n, the Fly Delta app, phone reservations, or ticket counters, for upgrades, miles, seat selection, Delta Sky Club\n\u00ae \nmembership, and in-flight purchases of food and beverages on Delta-operated flights (\u201cDelta Purchases\u201d). Delta Purchases do not include in-flight purchases where Delta is not the merchant of record, such as in-flight wireless internet access and charitable contributions. Delta Purchases do not include Delta Gift Cards and purchases made at \ndeltashop.com\n and/or the Delta Flight Museum. Delta Purchases include Delta Vacations\n\u00ae \npackages but not other all-inclusive packages. Delta Purchases include new Delta Stays prepaid hotel or vacation rental bookings on the Delta Stays platform (\ndelta.com/stays\n). Delta Purchases include purchases of qualifying Delta, Delta Connection\n\u00ae\n carrier and Delta Shuttle\n\u00ae \nflights taken with the purchase of a fare that is eligible for SkyMiles mileage credit. For purposes of this Card benefit, \u201cDelta Purchases\u201d also includes Delta Basic Economy fares, notwithstanding that these fares do not earn SkyMiles mileage credit for travel. Full SkyMiles program terms: \ndelta.com/memberguide. \nAdditional miles earned for Delta flight purchases made with the Card will be based on the total ticket price, including base fare, carrier-imposed surcharges and government-imposed taxes and fees.\nEligible purchases are purchases for goods and services minus returns and other credits. Eligible purchases do NOT include fees or interest charges, cash advances, purchases of travelers' checks, purchases of gift cards, person-to-person transactions, purchases or reloading of prepaid cards, or purchases of other cash equivalents. Miles will be posted to the Basic Card Member\u2019s Delta SkyMiles account 8 to 12 weeks after the end of each month. To be eligible to receive miles, the Card Account must not be canceled or past due at the time of fulfillment.\nMerchants are assigned codes based on what they primarily sell. We group certain merchant codes into categories that are eligible for additional miles. A purchase with a merchant will not receive additional miles if the merchant\u2019s code is not included in a reward category. Basic Card Members may not receive additional miles if we receive inaccurate information or are otherwise unable to identify the purchase as eligible for a reward category. For example, Basic Card Members may not receive additional miles when: a merchant uses a third-party to sell their products or services; or a merchant uses a third-party to process or submit the transaction to us (e.g., using mobile or wireless card readers); or Card Members choose to make a purchase using a third-party payment account or make a purchase using a mobile or digital wallet.\nFor questions about additional miles on a purchase, call the number on the back of your Card. Please visit\u00a0 \namericanexpress.com/rewards-info\n\u00a0for more information about rewards.\n4.\n\u00a0\nDelta Sky Club Access\nCard Members with a Delta SkyMiles\n\u00ae\n Reserve or Reserve Business American Express Basic or SkyMiles Reserve or Reserve Business Additional Card (each, an \"Eligible Card\") will receive 15 \"Visits\" per Eligible Card each year to the Delta Sky Club or to Grab and Go. Visits are issued at Card Account opening and then on February 1 of each subsequent year and expire on January 31 of each year. Visits are non-transferable and may only be used by the Eligible Card Member. Eligible Card Members traveling on a Delta partner airline flight that is not marketed or operated by Delta may access the Club at a per-Visit rate of $50 per person.\nA \"Visit\" is an entry to one or more Delta Sky Clubs or usage of the Delta Sky Club \"Grab and Go\" feature, at one or more airports, for a period of up to 24 hours starting upon the first Delta Sky Club entry or Grab and Go usage, during an Eligible Card Member\u2019s travel on a same-day Delta-marketed or Delta-operated flight. Eligible Card Members traveling on a Delta-marketed, Delta-operated flight or a Delta partner airline flight that is not marketed or operated by Delta with Basic Economy (E) fare tickets (or similar \"Light\" or \"basic\" tickets issued by a Delta partner) do not have access to the Delta Sky Club or to Grab and Go. A single Visit permits usage of Delta Sky Club(s) in multiple airports during the 24-hour period. For example, if you visit a Delta Sky Club in different airports on a trip, entry into one or more of these Clubs will be considered part of the same Visit as long as these additional entries occur within 24 hours of the first Delta Sky Club entry. If travel exceeds 24 hours from the first Delta Sky Club, then a second Visit will be deducted if entering the Delta Sky Club or using Grab and Go more than 24 hours after the first entry. Eligible Card Members may not access the Club or a Grab and Go location in the three hours from the time of previous Grab and Go usage at the same airport. Once all 15 Visits have been used, Eligible Card Members may purchase additional Delta Sky Club Visits at a per-Visit rate of $50 per person, or may purchase a Grab and Go Visit at a per-Visit rate of $25 per person. Visits cannot be used for guest entry. During a Visit, Eligible Card Members may bring either up to two (2) guests, or their immediate family (spouse/domestic partner and children under 21) to the Club at a per-Visit rate of $50 per person, or may purchase a Grab and Go Visit at a per-Visit rate of $25 per person. The Eligible Card must be used as the payment method to purchase Card Member and guest access. Guests must also be flying on a same-day Delta-marketed or Delta-operated flight or Delta partner airline flight and be accompanied by the Eligible Card Member. Guests traveling on a Delta-marketed, Delta operated flight or a Delta partner airline flight that is not marketed or operated by Delta with Basic Economy (E) fare tickets (or similar \"Light\" or \"basic\" tickets issued by a Delta partner) do not have access to the Delta Sky Club or to Grab and Go. Children under 2 years of age may accompany the Eligible Card Member for free.\nEligible Card Members with multiple eligible American Express Cards that grant Delta Sky Club access are responsible for selecting their method of entry into a Delta Sky Club prior to entry. Visits will be deducted based on the eligible American Express Card presented at time of entry. Switching the American Express Card used for entry after a Card Member has entered a Delta Sky Club is not permitted.\nTo earn an unlimited number of Visits (\"Unlimited Delta Sky Club Access\"), the total eligible purchases on the Eligible Card Account must equal or exceed $75,000 (the \"Purchase Requirement\") in each calendar year. Once effective, Unlimited Delta Sky Club Access will be provided to both the Basic and Additional Reserve Card Members on the Eligible Card Account. All entry requirements set forth in these Terms and Conditions will continue to apply with respect to Unlimited Delta Sky Club Access.\nUnlimited Delta Sky Club Access will be processed within a week of the Eligible Card Account\u2019s satisfying the Purchase Requirement in most instances but may take up to 12 weeks to become effective. Once effective, Unlimited Delta Sky Club Access will be available for the remainder of the calendar year in which it became effective, the following calendar year and through January 31 of the next calendar year (for example, if Unlimited Delta Sky Club Access becomes effective on May 1, 2025, it will remain effective through January 31, 2027). Eligible purchases made by any Additional Card Members on the Eligible Card Account will contribute to the Purchase Requirement. Eligible purchases to meet the Purchase Requirement are for goods and services minus returns and other credits. Eligible purchases do NOT include fees, interest charges, cash advances, purchases of travelers\u2019 checks, purchases or reloading of prepaid cards, purchases of gift cards, person-to-person payments, or other cash equivalents. If a Card Member upgrades to an Eligible Card from a different Delta SkyMiles Card, eligible purchases made on the prior Delta SkyMiles Card Account will count toward the Purchase Requirement. Delta reserves the right to revoke Unlimited Delta Sky Club Access if you return, reverse or charge back eligible purchases in a way that reduces your eligible spend below the Purchase Requirement for the calendar year. If Delta and/or American Express determine that you have engaged in abuse, misuse, or gaming in connection with this Delta Sky Club Access Benefit in any way or that you intend to do so, Visits may be deducted from your account and/or Unlimited Delta Sky Club Access revoked.\nEligible Card Members must present their valid Card, government-issued I.D., and boarding pass for entry. Boarding pass must show a reservation for a same-day Delta-marketed or Delta-operated flight departing from or arriving at the airport in which the Delta Sky Club is located. Eligible Card Members traveling on a same-day Delta-marketed, Delta-operated flight or a Delta partner airline flight that is not marketed or operated by Delta with Basic Economy (E) fare tickets (or similar \"Light\" or \"basic\" tickets issued by a Delta partner) will not have access to the Delta Sky Club or to Grab and Go. Name on boarding pass must match name on the Card. Eligible Card Members on departing flights can only access the Delta Sky Club or the Delta Sky Club \"Grab and Go\" feature within 3 hours of their flight\u2019s scheduled departure time or at any time during a layover. Delta reserves the right to limit access for non-revenue flyers at any Delta Sky Club. Individuals must be at least 18 years of age to access Delta Sky Club, and 21 years of age to access locations with a self-service bar, unless accompanied by a responsible, supervising adult who has access to the Club. Benefit valid only at Delta Sky Club. Partner lounges are not included. Note that amenities may vary among Delta Sky Club locations. Access is subject to Delta Sky Club House Rules. To review the House Rules, please visit \ndelta.com/skyclub\n. Benefit and rules subject to change without notice. Additional restrictions may apply.\n5.\n\u00a0MQD Headstart\nEffective February 1, 2024:\n\u00a0Basic Delta SkyMiles Reserve and Reserve Business American Express Card Members (each, an \u201cEligible Card\u201d), will receive two thousand five hundred (2,500) Medallion Qualification Dollars (MQDs) which will be deposited into their SkyMiles account linked to an Eligible Card during each Qualification Year. Additional Card Members are not eligible.\n\u00a0\nStarting with the 2024 Qualification Year, MQDs will be deposited within 6 to 8 weeks after February 1 for existing Card Members. New Card Members and Card Members upgrading from another Delta SkyMiles American Express Card that is not eligible for the MQD Headstart benefit to an Eligible Card will be eligible for the MQD Headstart benefit. MQDs will be deposited within 6 to 8 weeks after an Eligible Card Account is opened, and thereafter every subsequent year within 6 to 8 weeks after February 1 while the Eligible Card Account is open; however, if a New Eligible Card Account is opened during November or December of a Qualification Year, MQDs will be applied to the Qualification Year in which the Card is opened. MQDs earned during a Qualification Year are used to determine qualification for Medallion Status for the subsequent Medallion Year for the Basic Card Member. MQDs have no cash value and are not redeemable for Award Travel or other SkyMiles redemptions. MQDs are not transferrable or assignable to any other person and cannot be gifted to another SkyMiles member.\n\u00a0\nAll Medallion Status Qualification and Medallion Benefit rules and policies apply and may be viewed at \ndelta.com/medallion \n. MQDs will not extend or roll over from year to year, and MQD balance will be reset to zero on or about January 1 each calendar year. Medallion Status is calculated annually based on activity during a Qualification Year. A Qualification Year is from January 1 to December 31 of a given year. The close of the Qualification Year is December 31, without regard to the time of the year that the Card Account is opened. Delta reserves the right to cancel, rescind, or void any MQDs or to cancel or downgrade Medallion Status (based on the adjusted number of MQDs earned) if the Card is cancelled or downgraded to a non-Eligible Card within 60 days after the date that MQDs are deposited or within 60 days after the Eligible Card renewal date. To receive the MQDs, your account must not be cancelled or past due at the time the MQDs are posted to your account. If Delta and/or American Express determine that you have engaged in abuse, misuse, or gaming in connection with this MQD Headstart in any way or that you intend to do so, Delta may not credit, Delta may freeze, or Delta may take away MQDs from your account or terminate your participation in the SkyMiles Program.\n\u00a0\nBasic Card Members can confirm their MQD progress for a Qualification Year by logging into their SkyMiles account on \ndelta.com \n\u00a0or in the Fly Delta app. Regardless of the number of Eligible Cards a SkyMiles Member may hold, each SkyMiles Member may only receive one $2,500 MQD deposit per Eligible Card type each Medallion Qualification Year and is limited to a maximum of four deposits across all Eligible Cards each Medallion Qualification Year (for $10,000 MQDs total). Card Members who upgrade from an Eligible Platinum or Platinum Business Card to an Eligible Reserve or Reserve Business Card will not be awarded an additional $2,500 MQD deposit for the Reserve or Reserve Business Card, and Card Members who downgrade from an Eligible Reserve or Reserve Business Card to an Eligible Platinum or Platinum Business Card will not be awarded an additional $2,500 MQD deposit for the Platinum or Platinum Business Card.\u00a0\n6.\n\u00a0MQD Boost\nEffective January 1, 2024:\n Basic Card Members will earn one (1) Medallion Qualification Dollar (MQD) for each $10 of eligible purchases charged to their Delta SkyMiles\n\u00ae\n Reserve and Delta SkyMiles\n\u00ae \nReserve Business American Express Card or any Additional Cards on the Card Account during a Qualification Year. MQDs earned during a Qualification Year are used to determine qualification for Medallion Status for the subsequent Medallion Year for the Basic Card Member. MQDs have no cash value and are not redeemable for Award Travel or other SkyMiles redemptions. MQDs are not transferrable or assignable to any other person and cannot be gifted to another SkyMiles member.\n\u00a0\nAll Medallion Status Qualification and Medallion Benefits rules and policies apply and may be viewed at \ndelta.com/medallion \n. MQDs will not extend or roll over from year to year, and MQD balance will be reset to zero on or about January 1 each calendar year. Medallion Status is calculated annually based on activity during a Qualification Year. A Qualification Year is from January 1 to December 31 of a given year. The close of the Qualification Year is December 31, without regard to the time of the year that the Card Account is opened. This means that for the first year of Card Membership, the Card Member's eligible purchase period for the MQD Benefit may be shorter than twelve months.\nEligible purchases are purchases for goods and services minus returns and other credits. Eligible purchases do NOT include fees, interest charges, cash advances, purchases of travelers' checks, person-to-person transactions, purchases or reloading of prepaid cards, purchases of gift cards, or purchases of other cash equivalents. American Express relies on the transaction date submitted to us by the merchant, which may differ from the date you make a purchase, to determine whether the purchase counts toward the MQD threshold in that Qualification Year. This means that in some cases your purchases may not count toward the MQD threshold in the year in which you made the purchases. For example, if you make a purchase on December 31 and the merchant lists the transaction date as January 1 when they submit the transaction data to us, your purchase will be counted in the Qualification Year which began on that January 1. MQDs will be deducted from the MQD Balance (and may result in a negative MQD Balance) for any returns or other credits, and Delta reserves the right to adjust, remove, or suspend Medallion Status if you return, reverse or charge back eligible purchases in a way that reduces your MQD balance below the threshold of any Medallion Tier for the preceding Qualification Year. To receive the MQDs, your account must not be canceled or past due at the time the MQDs are posted to your account. If Delta and/or American Express determine that you have engaged in abuse, misuse, or gaming in connection with this MQD Benefit in any way or that you intend to do so, Delta may not credit, Delta may freeze, or Delta may take away MQDs from your account or terminate your participation in the SkyMiles Program.\n\u00a0\nMQDs may take 8 to 12 weeks after the eligible transaction posts to the Card Account to be posted to the Basic Card Member's Delta SkyMiles account. Basic Card Members can confirm their MQD progress for a Qualification Year by logging into their SkyMiles account on \ndelta.com\n\u00a0or in the Fly Delta app.\u00a0\n7.\n\u00a0\nDelta Platinum Companion Certificate at Renewal\nEligibility:\nBasic Card Members with a Delta SkyMiles Platinum or Platinum Business American Express Card will receive a Companion Certificate each year after Card Account renewal, eligible for use on Delta, Delta Connection carrier and Delta Shuttle flights only (excludes all other Delta-designated codeshare flights).

    "body": "Hello everyone,\u00a0\nFirst and\u00a0foremost, congratulations to your young men on earning a spot on the Junior Varsity baseball team at DePaul Prep. My name is Sam Colon, and I am the head Varsity coach. We are incredibly\u00a0excited for the development\u00a0of this group and to watch them grow! This group will be led by Coach Zach Hinkamp and Coach Roi Montalvo!\nCouple\u00a0important things for you to know:\nPractice Schedule 3/6-3/8\nThursday, March 6\n5;30-7:30p - Clark Park\u00a0\nFriday, March 7\n5-30-7:30p - Clark Park\nSaturday, March 8\n12-2p - Clark Park\nThe game schedule\u00a0is posted on our \nwebsite\n\u00a0and will be the most up to date version of a schedule. We will be looking for 2-3 team parents to help coaches along the way with team meals/snacks or anything in between.\u00a0\nPicture day and the parent meeting (6pm) are next week Wednesday, March 12th. The boys will get their time slot and\u00a0direction from coach directly for picture day. If you have attended a Fall and/or a Winter parent meeting this year, you DO NOT need to attend until my portion of the meeting at 6:30p.\nLastly, the team shop has reopened for any of you that missed that last one or want to order more gear! Here is the link.\u00a0\nhttps://bsnteamsports.com/shop/DCPBASE2\nI believe that is all, if you have any questions please let me or Coach Hinkamp know. Congratulations again and GO RAMS!\u00a0\n-- \nSam Colon\u00a0\nAssistant Athletic Director\nHead Varsity Baseball Coach\u00a0\nMailing Address:\n 3333 N.
