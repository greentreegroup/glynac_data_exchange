Now that this policy has been in this mode for 90 days, it\u2019ll be automatically turned to \nOn\n during the week of June 10, 2024. \nOnce the policy is on, all users covered by it will need to have multifactor authentication. \nThe\n per-user multifactor authentication users \npolicy doesn\u2019t affect users\u2019 experience as they\u2019re already using multifactor authentication\n. \nThis policy helps you migrate to Microsoft Entra Conditional Access, which offers a number of \nimprovements\n, including a better admin experience and more granular access control. \nRequired action \nTo avoid any potential disruption to users\u2019 access and to ensure that this policy meets your organization's needs, \ntake the following actions before June 10, 2024: \nReview the \neffects and benefits\n of this policy. If you don\u2019t want us to turn it on automatically, set it to \nOff\n. Or, you may set it to \nOn\n at any time.\nCustomize this policy according to your specific needs, such as \nexcluding emergency access accounts\n. To make more extensive customizations, you can duplicate Microsoft-managed policies and make any changes you need.\u202f \nVerify that all users covered by this policy have enabled and registered at least one multifactor authentication method. If necessary, \nrun a registration campaign\n to set up the Authenticator app. \nHelp and support \nLearn more about \nMicrosoft-managed Conditional Access policies\n.

The course had a certain unforgiving math to it: five students plus one fat book a week equaled zero places to hide if you hadn\u2019t done the reading.\n\u00a0\nBut what forgave it all, and made you keep up, was our teacher\u2019s way of opening one of those tomes like a Faberg\u00e9 egg to expose the intricate workings inside. Thirty-five years have not dimmed the sense I had then of gaining new powers.\n\u00a0\nAs the academic year winds down, my mind turns to teachers past and to those who have taught at the University of Chicago memorably well.\n\u00a0\nThis month, teaching awards will be handed to two such scholars nominated by their past students\u00a0when John J. MacAloon, AM\u201974, PhD\u201980, and Martha C. Nussbaum receive the Norman Maclean Faculty Award. Shortly thereafter, the University will name the newest recipients of the Llewellyn John and Harriet Manchester Quantrell Awards for Excellence in Undergraduate Teaching and the Faculty Awards for Excellence in Graduate Teaching and Mentoring. The evidence suggests that for these teachers, there are few honors that mean more.\n\u00a0\nI spoke to MacAloon for this issue about his teaching and, with the Paris Summer Games approaching, his life\u2019s research on the Olympics. At the end of the Q&A he encapsulates what educating students means to him and how he did that important work day to day, student by student. (To find out what and how, read \u201cLight Bearer\u201d\n \nin this issue\n.) For his and Nussbaum\u2019s nominators, nobody did it better.\n\u00a0\nWhat did your best teacher do like nobody else? Tell us at\u00a0\nuchicago-magazine@uchicago.edu\n. We are always grateful to hear your stories and to share them with our community.\n\u00a0\nFinally, some staff news. As of April, Susie Allen, AB\u201909, is back at the \nMagazine\n as senior associate editor extraordinaire. You may remember Susie\u2019s byline gracing our pages often from 2015 to 2023, as well as the issues that she artfully guest edited. Starting with the Summer/24 issue, the light of Susie\u2019s writing will again shine down on all.\n\u00a0\nBest wishes,\n\u00a0\n \n\u00a0\nLaura Demanski, AM\u201994\nEditor\n\u00a0\nP.S.
