    "body": "In 2025, be more efficient with Zoom\u2019s AI Companion. Dear Valued Customer, As Zoom evolves, we want to help you stay up to date on how the latest products and features can help you work and collaborate\n \nIn 2025, be more efficient with Zoom\u2019s AI Companion. \n \nDear Valued Customer,\n \n\u00a0 \nAs Zoom evolves, we want to help you stay up to date on how the latest products and features can help you work and collaborate better. We\u2019ll outline some highlights below, including opportunities for further learning.\n \n\u00a0 \nTo get more detailed information about the latest releases, here are a few resources:\u00a0\n \nZoom Digital Customer Success Hub\n - This event hub is full of training and information sessions hosted by the Zoom Digital Customer Success team.\u00a0\n \nWhat\u2019s New at Zoom blog\n - The blog is a great spot to keep up with Zoom, and the What\u2019s New post is regularly updated with info about new products and features.\u00a0\n \nPreview notes\n - A list of upcoming features. This page is only available to Zoom account owners and admins; you must sign in to view them.\n \nRelease notes\n - A complete list of past releases across the Zoom platform.\u00a0\n \n\u00a0 \nIf you have questions about the features and announcements outlined below, please reply directly to this email.\n \n\u00a0\n*Note: Some products and features may not be available to all customers.\n \nEvents & Training\nZoom Contact Center Insights: Success Stories & New Feature Deep Dives -\n \nRegister now\n \nto learn more about the latest ZCC features and how they can help you streamline your data center operations.\u00a0\n \nIn 2025, be more efficient with Zoom\u2019s AI Companion\n \nYou may have heard about Zoom\u2019s AI Companion 2.0 when we announced it last year during Zoomtopia. To help you work and collaborate more effectively in 2025, we wanted to take a closer look at this included* tool and how you can implement it within your organization.\u00a0\n \nAsk AI Companion questions about what has happened in a meeting to quickly catch up!\n \nWhat is AI Companion 2.0?\nAI Companion 2.0 is your next-generation AI assistant that surfaces important information in a convenient side panel, helping you prioritize what matters most and providing suggestions to help you stay on top of your work. With this tool, you can: \n\u00a0\nUse prompt suggestions and generate answers from AI Companion\n via a convenient side panel across Zoom Workplace, including Zoom Meetings, Zoom Team Chat, Zoom Docs, Zoom Calendar, and Zoom Mail.\u00a0\n \nExpand the context of information.\n \nAI Companion helps you stay organized and on top of your day because it has context from your data generated across Zoom Workplace, including your Zoom Meetings and, when connected, information from Microsoft Outlook, Gmail, Google Calendar, and uploaded files from Microsoft Office and Google Docs. AI Companion remembers previous conversations you\u2019ve had within the side panel and interactions from across Zoom Workplace.\n \nGenerate next steps from a meeting summary\n and, coming soon, AI Companion will be able to automatically turn those next steps into Zoom Tasks to help keep teams aligned and on track to deliver projects on time. Keep an eye out for the release of Zoom Tasks in the near future.\u00a0\n \nSummarize unread messages within a Zoom Team Chat channel\n to easily stay up to date on team conversations and avoid getting bogged down in unread chats. Within the new home tab, AI Companion will be able to provide users with a list of updates based on unread chats and emails.\n \nRecap email threads\n in Zoom Mail\n without having to read every message.\n \n \nThe AI Companion side panel in the Zoom Workplace app can help answer your questions. Use the prompts or ask your own!\n \nHow do I manage AI Companion 2.0 for my account?\n \nAs an account admin or owner, you can control AI Companion features in the Zoom web portal. You can choose to enable or disable AI Companion features for all users on the account or specific groups of users. Individual users can also enable or disable some AI features for their own use, if not locked by an admin at the account or group level. For more details, see our support article on \nhow to enable or disable Zoom AI Companion features\n.\n \nHow do I help my users get started?\n \nMaking sure AI Companion 2.0 is enabled is the first step, but users may need some guidance on how to get the most out of this new tool. We recommend providing them with resources from the \nAI Companion Onboarding Center\n.\n\u00a0\nThis library is open to all and can be filtered by product and asset type to help you find what you need fast. You can view, download, and share setup guides, demo videos, email templates to introduce your end users to AI Companion, and more.\u00a0\n\u00a0\n*Included at no additional cost with the paid services assigned to Zoom user accounts. AI Companion may not be available for all regions and industry verticals.\n \nService Updates\n \nZoom firewall settings -\n \nZoom is continuously optimizing our global footprint to improve performance and availability for our customers. Customers should not need to perform any active changes provided they are following the guidance as provided in our support article \n\u201cNetwork Firewall Settings for CRC and Enhanced API Connector.\u201d\n For any questions or concerns, please contact your account team or \nZoom Support\n.\n \nCatch us on social \n \nYou're receiving this email because you are a Zoom customer. \nIf you wish to be removed from our email list, \nunsubscribe\n or \nmanage your email preferences.",
