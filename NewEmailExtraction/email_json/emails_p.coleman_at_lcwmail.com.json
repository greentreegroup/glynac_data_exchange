    "body": "In 2025, be more efficient with Zoom\u2019s AI Companion. Dear Valued Customer, As Zoom evolves, we want to help you stay up to date on how the latest products and features can help you work and collaborate\n \nIn 2025, be more efficient with Zoom\u2019s AI Companion. \n \nDear Valued Customer,\n \n\u00a0 \nAs Zoom evolves, we want to help you stay up to date on how the latest products and features can help you work and collaborate better. We\u2019ll outline some highlights below, including opportunities for further learning.\n \n\u00a0 \nTo get more detailed information about the latest releases, here are a few resources:\u00a0\n \nZoom Digital Customer Success Hub\n - This event hub is full of training and information sessions hosted by the Zoom Digital Customer Success team.\u00a0\n \nWhat\u2019s New at Zoom blog\n - The blog is a great spot to keep up with Zoom, and the What\u2019s New post is regularly updated with info about new products and features.\u00a0\n \nPreview notes\n - A list of upcoming features. This page is only available to Zoom account owners and admins; you must sign in to view them.\n \nRelease notes\n - A complete list of past releases across the Zoom platform.\u00a0\n \n\u00a0 \nIf you have questions about the features and announcements outlined below, please reply directly to this email.\n \n\u00a0\n*Note: Some products and features may not be available to all customers.\n \nEvents & Training\nZoom Contact Center Insights: Success Stories & New Feature Deep Dives -\n \nRegister now\n \nto learn more about the latest ZCC features and how they can help you streamline your data center operations.\u00a0\n \nIn 2025, be more efficient with Zoom\u2019s AI Companion\n \nYou may have heard about Zoom\u2019s AI Companion 2.0 when we announced it last year during Zoomtopia. To help you work and collaborate more effectively in 2025, we wanted to take a closer look at this included* tool and how you can implement it within your organization.\u00a0\n \nAsk AI Companion questions about what has happened in a meeting to quickly catch up!\n \nWhat is AI Companion 2.0?\nAI Companion 2.0 is your next-generation AI assistant that surfaces important information in a convenient side panel, helping you prioritize what matters most and providing suggestions to help you stay on top of your work. With this tool, you can: \n\u00a0\nUse prompt suggestions and generate answers from AI Companion\n via a convenient side panel across Zoom Workplace, including Zoom Meetings, Zoom Team Chat, Zoom Docs, Zoom Calendar, and Zoom Mail.\u00a0\n \nExpand the context of information.\n \nAI Companion helps you stay organized and on top of your day because it has context from your data generated across Zoom Workplace, including your Zoom Meetings and, when connected, information from Microsoft Outlook, Gmail, Google Calendar, and uploaded files from Microsoft Office and Google Docs. AI Companion remembers previous conversations you\u2019ve had within the side panel and interactions from across Zoom Workplace.\n \nGenerate next steps from a meeting summary\n and, coming soon, AI Companion will be able to automatically turn those next steps into Zoom Tasks to help keep teams aligned and on track to deliver projects on time. Keep an eye out for the release of Zoom Tasks in the near future.\u00a0\n \nSummarize unread messages within a Zoom Team Chat channel\n to easily stay up to date on team conversations and avoid getting bogged down in unread chats. Within the new home tab, AI Companion will be able to provide users with a list of updates based on unread chats and emails.\n \nRecap email threads\n in Zoom Mail\n without having to read every message.\n \n \nThe AI Companion side panel in the Zoom Workplace app can help answer your questions. Use the prompts or ask your own!\n \nHow do I manage AI Companion 2.0 for my account?\n \nAs an account admin or owner, you can control AI Companion features in the Zoom web portal. You can choose to enable or disable AI Companion features for all users on the account or specific groups of users. Individual users can also enable or disable some AI features for their own use, if not locked by an admin at the account or group level. For more details, see our support article on \nhow to enable or disable Zoom AI Companion features\n.\n \nHow do I help my users get started?\n \nMaking sure AI Companion 2.0 is enabled is the first step, but users may need some guidance on how to get the most out of this new tool. We recommend providing them with resources from the \nAI Companion Onboarding Center\n.\n\u00a0\nThis library is open to all and can be filtered by product and asset type to help you find what you need fast. You can view, download, and share setup guides, demo videos, email templates to introduce your end users to AI Companion, and more.\u00a0\n\u00a0\n*Included at no additional cost with the paid services assigned to Zoom user accounts. AI Companion may not be available for all regions and industry verticals.\n \nService Updates\n \nZoom firewall settings -\n \nZoom is continuously optimizing our global footprint to improve performance and availability for our customers. Customers should not need to perform any active changes provided they are following the guidance as provided in our support article \n\u201cNetwork Firewall Settings for CRC and Enhanced API Connector.\u201d\n For any questions or concerns, please contact your account team or \nZoom Support\n.\n \nCatch us on social \n \nYou're receiving this email because you are a Zoom customer. \nIf you wish to be removed from our email list, \nunsubscribe\n or \nmanage your email preferences.",

Recognition=Praises, email, public announcements but Rewards= Tangible perks in addition to salary. When discuss goals, objectives and outcomes expected we can confirm. \nI will say we should\u00a0 keep the title as Managing Bias in Rewards & Recogntion\" since internally we usually talk about Rewards & Recognition and not Compensation & Recognition but\u00a0 we will definitely discuss the\u00a0 specific content to be included.\n2.\n\u00a0\u00a0 \nWe spoke about Q1 to work on this ML.

Recognition=Praises, email, public announcements but Rewards= Tangible perks in addition to salary. When discuss goals, objectives and outcomes expected we can confirm. \nI will say we should\u00a0 keep the title as Managing Bias in Rewards & Recogntion\" since internally we usually talk about Rewards & Recognition and not Compensation & Recognition but\u00a0 we will definitely discuss the\u00a0 specific content to be included.\n2.\n\u00a0\u00a0 \nWe spoke about Q1 to work on this ML.

In which languages? The 5 we did before?\nHow many total word? Do you estimate around 5000 like the ones we did before?\nAre there any PDF that will need translation?\nDo you have the English video you can share with me so I can quote English VO?\nWill you need other languages VO and subtitle?\nI would be able to confirm on translation timeline and VO/Subtitle timeline. But cannot guarantee on implementation (putting all localized content on the microlearning) since that, according to what I understand, would be in the hands of Arvinder.\n\u00a0\nPlease let me know and I would work on it ASAP.

I see that tittle is \u201cManaging Bias in Compensation & Recognition\" vs \u201cRewards & Recognition\u201d. The latter came up during our last call. Recognition=Praises, email, public announcements but Rewards= Tangible perks in addition to salary. When discuss goals, objectives and outcomes expected we can confirm. \nI will say we should\u00a0 keep the title as Managing Bias in Rewards & Recogntion\" since internally we usually talk about Rewards & Recognition and not Compensation & Recognition but\u00a0 we will definitely discuss the\u00a0 specific content to be included.\n2.\n\u00a0\u00a0 \nWe spoke about Q1 to work on this ML.

I have never been this sick so I would appreciate your patience with me. I am functional though my ability to speak will be limited until I recover more hopefully sooner rather than later.\u00a0I will reserve my speaking for client meetings and on rest of meetings I will reply in chat unless absolutely necessary to speak.\nThank you for your understanding & patience.

I see that tittle is \u201cManaging Bias in Compensation & Recognition\" vs \u201cRewards & Recognition\u201d. The latter came up during our last call. Recognition=Praises, email, public announcements but Rewards= Tangible perks in addition to salary. When discuss goals, objectives and outcomes expected we can confirm. \nI will say we should\u00a0 keep the title as Managing Bias in Rewards & Recogntion\" since internally we usually talk about Rewards & Recognition and not Compensation & Recognition but\u00a0 we will definitely discuss the\u00a0 specific content to be included.\n2.\n\u00a0\u00a0 \nWe spoke about Q1 to work on this ML.

This would look like:\nAug.2025 - Patricia gets $3,400 when ML billed (Colgate)\nAug.2026 - Patricia gets $3,200 when ML billed (Colgate)\nTBD - Patricia gets $2,160 when Spotlights are billed (Sony)\nFor any new SOWs from these clients, she will get 20% of the SOW (minus COGS).\u00a0\nGrowing the client gets another SOW & 20% from that.\nFor IDIs,\n Individual: \n??? \nGroup: \n???\nFor facilitation\n, Patricia would be expected to lead facilitations on her own SOWs (where appropriate) as part of the 20% payment. LCW could pay her up to $250 per hour for facilitation outside of her own SOWs.\n\u00a0\nPlease let me know if I captured anything incorrectly or incompletely. We will need to talk about UL if they come back in the next few days with the CCLP and Global Forum.\n\u00a0\nChuck Adams\n \n(He/Him)\nChief Executive Officer\nLCW\nOffice: \n+1.773.938.4285\nMobile: +1.630.373.5068\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\nWebsite\n\u00a0\n|\n\u00a0\nTwitter\n \n|\n\u00a0\nFacebook\n\u00a0\n|\n\u00a0\nLinkedIn\nView our upcoming events\n \n| \nSign-up for our newsletter",

Recognition=Praises, email, public announcements but Rewards= Tangible perks in addition to salary. When discuss goals, objectives and outcomes expected we can confirm. \nI will say we should\u00a0 keep the title as Managing Bias in Rewards & Recogntion\" since internally we usually talk about Rewards & Recognition and not Compensation & Recognition but\u00a0 we will definitely discuss the\u00a0 specific content to be included.\n2.\n\u00a0\u00a0 \nWe spoke about Q1 to work on this ML.

I see that tittle is \u201cManaging Bias in Compensation & Recognition\" vs \u201cRewards & Recognition\u201d. The latter came up during our last call. Recognition=Praises, email, public announcements but Rewards= Tangible perks in addition to salary. When discuss goals, objectives and outcomes expected we can confirm. \nI will say we should\u00a0 keep the title as Managing Bias in Rewards & Recogntion\" since internally we usually talk about Rewards & Recognition and not Compensation & Recognition but\u00a0 we will definitely discuss the\u00a0 specific content to be included.\n2.\n\u00a0\u00a0 \nWe spoke about Q1 to work on this ML.

Looks like 5-10/Not much \nVicki committed to a certain number of \ninitial \nIDIs. I believe she did a few already & there are 5-10 left. But this is just the initial group, so I understood. They want to roll out more.\u00a0\nWhat is the revenue passed on from Vicki to LCW? \nNot quite sure yet. Initially it could be around $8-$17k for IDIs & coaching. There would be an initial training, perhaps valued at $5,500. Vicki seems pretty sure there will be more work needed.\n\u00a0\nGive me the weekend to consider all scenarios.\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\nPatricia M Coleman\u00a0\n(She-Elle-Ella)\nSr Consultant\u00a0\u00a0\nLCW\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\nWebsite\n\u00a0\n|\n\u00a0\nTwitter\n\u00a0\n|\n\u00a0\nFacebook\n\u00a0\n|\n\u00a0\nLinkedIn\nView our upcoming events\n\u00a0| \nSign-up for our newsletter\n\u00a0\nFrom:\n\u00a0Nicole Barile <n.barile@lcwmail.com>\nSent:\n\u00a0Friday, January 24, 2025 1:08 PM\nTo:\n\u00a0Patricia Coleman <p.coleman@lcwmail.com>\nCc:\n\u00a0Chuck Adams <c.adams@lcwmail.com>\nSubject:\n\u00a0New opportunity\n\u00a0\nHi Patricia,\n\u00a0\nThank you for your continued grace working with LCW. I know this is a difficult time for all of us.\n\u00a0\nI want to give you a heads up about a new opportunity that we have coming in....and I hope you will take this \n\ud83d\ude42\n.\nPlease confirm if you are OK to take this on. (\nMy email below assumes you are).\n\u00a0\nDo you know Vicki Hudson? I've worked with her in the past in the intercultural world. Well, she is handing us an opportunity that she is bringing us. She has started an engagement with a company but has to stop for personal reasons.\nThe immediate details are as follows:\nClient: NTT Data \nhttps://www.nttdata.com/global/en/\nVicki has been doing an IDI package for leaders that includes:\n1 hour IDI debrief + 1 hour executive coaching session\nShe's not sure how many more they need, but there may be an additional 5-10 IDI packages for leaders\nThe IDIs might be for folks in Asia\u00a0\nThe client wants to also do Cultural Competence training for the Executive Leadership Team, but she doesn't know exactly what that will look like yet\nNot sure if you know but we used to sell IDIs along with our BCI training; just a thought - they may not need this\nThey will also likely continue to do more IDIs ongoing\nThey need someone who gets global/intl work (you \n\ud83d\ude42\n)\nThey want to spread cultural competence throughout the org, so Vicki thinks there will be more work down the road\nAdditional notes that I took from my call with Vicki that we can talk about once Vicki confirms this handover to us:\nVicki is working w exec ldship team. They manage regionally & globally.\nShe did listening tours - mostly with senior leaders\nThe company has a lot of issues - some say the CEO is US centric, but others say he's dedicated to DEI\nVicki reported findings & made recommendations to exec ldshp team that included training & IDI\nMight want ldsp training in Singapore.\nVicki Recommended IDI + GlobeSmart or Country Navigator\nMost who've taken the IDI so far are in minimization, but some below & some above\nGlobal head of HR, 2 HR Leaders - who Vicki is working with - one person is very particular\nShe committed to 6 IDIs - debrief + follow up coaching session with each leader (2 sessions)\nShe wants to transfer seamlessly to LCW\nVicki would transfer knowledge, including her findings & recommendations\nNext steps:\nVicki is giving the client our names & will introduce us both hopefully next week\nWe can have a call with the client & Vicki if needed to hand off to us\nI would just be on initial call; you would lead\nWe will schedule a call with Vicki to discuss more in detail\nI know this is a lot. LMK if you have any immediate questions.\nOtherwise, I'll update you once I hear from Vicki.\n\u00a0\nThank you!\nNicole\n\u00a0\nNicole Barile\n\u00a0\n(She/Her)\nChief Operating Officer\nLCW\n\u00a0\nWebsite\n\u00a0\n|\n\u00a0\nTwitter\n\u00a0\n|\n\u00a0\nFacebook\n\u00a0\n|\n\u00a0\nLinkedIn\nView our upcoming events\n\u00a0| \nSign-up for our newsletter",

I know this is a difficult time for all of us.\n\u00a0\nI want to give you a heads up about a new opportunity that we have coming in....and I hope you will take this \n\ud83d\ude42\n.\nPlease confirm if you are OK to take this on. (\nMy email below assumes you are).\n\u00a0\nDo you know Vicki Hudson? I've worked with her in the past in the intercultural world. Well, she is handing us an opportunity that she is bringing us. She has started an engagement with a company but has to stop for personal reasons.\nThe immediate details are as follows:\nClient: NTT Data \nhttps://www.nttdata.com/global/en/\nVicki has been doing an IDI package for leaders that includes:\n1 hour IDI debrief + 1 hour executive coaching session\nShe's not sure how many more they need, but there may be an additional 5-10 IDI packages for leaders\nThe IDIs might be for folks in Asia\u00a0\nThe client wants to also do Cultural Competence training for the Executive Leadership Team, but she doesn't know exactly what that will look like yet\nNot sure if you know but we used to sell IDIs along with our BCI training; just a thought - they may not need this\nThey will also likely continue to do more IDIs ongoing\nThey need someone who gets global/intl work (you \n\ud83d\ude42\n)\nThey want to spread cultural competence throughout the org, so Vicki thinks there will be more work down the road\nAdditional notes that I took from my call with Vicki that we can talk about once Vicki confirms this handover to us:\nVicki is working w exec ldship team. They manage regionally & globally.\nShe did listening tours - mostly with senior leaders\nThe company has a lot of issues - some say the CEO is US centric, but others say he's dedicated to DEI\nVicki reported findings & made recommendations to exec ldshp team that included training & IDI\nMight want ldsp training in Singapore.\nVicki Recommended IDI + GlobeSmart or Country Navigator\nMost who've taken the IDI so far are in minimization, but some below & some above\nGlobal head of HR, 2 HR Leaders - who Vicki is working with - one person is very particular\nShe committed to 6 IDIs - debrief + follow up coaching session with each leader (2 sessions)\nShe wants to transfer seamlessly to LCW\nVicki would transfer knowledge, including her findings & recommendations\nNext steps:\nVicki is giving the client our names & will introduce us both hopefully next week\nWe can have a call with the client & Vicki if needed to hand off to us\nI would just be on initial call; you would lead\nWe will schedule a call with Vicki to discuss more in detail\nI know this is a lot. LMK if you have any immediate questions.\nOtherwise, I'll update you once I hear from Vicki.\n\u00a0\nThank you!\nNicole\n\u00a0\nNicole Barile\n\u00a0\n(She/Her)\nChief Operating Officer\nLCW\n\u00a0\nWebsite\n\u00a0\n|\n\u00a0\nTwitter\n\u00a0\n|\n\u00a0\nFacebook\n\u00a0\n|\n\u00a0\nLinkedIn\nView our upcoming events\n\u00a0| \nSign-up for our newsletter",

I know this is a difficult time for all of us.\nI want to give you a heads up about a new opportunity that we have coming in....and I hope you will take this \ud83d\ude42.\nPlease confirm if you are OK to take this on. (\nMy email below assumes you are).\nDo you know Vicki Hudson? I've worked with her in the past in the intercultural world. Well, she is handing us an opportunity that she is bringing us. She has started an engagement with a company but has to stop for personal reasons.\nThe immediate details are as follows:\nClient: NTT Data \nhttps://www.nttdata.com/global/en/\nVicki has been doing an IDI package for leaders that includes:\n1 hour IDI debrief + 1 hour executive coaching session\nShe's not sure how many more they need, but there may be an additional 5-10 IDI packages for leaders\nThe IDIs might be for folks in Asia\u00a0\nThe client wants to also do Cultural Competence training for the Executive Leadership Team, but she doesn't know exactly what that will look like yet\nNot sure if you know but we used to sell IDIs along with our BCI training; just a thought - they may not need this\nThey will also likely continue to do more IDIs ongoing\nThey need someone who gets global/intl work (you \ud83d\ude42)\nThey want to spread cultural competence throughout the org, so Vicki thinks there will be more work down the road\nAdditional notes that I took from my call with Vicki that we can talk about once Vicki confirms this handover to us:\nVicki is working w exec ldship team. They manage regionally & globally.\nShe did listening tours - mostly with senior leaders\nThe company has a lot of issues - some say the CEO is US centric, but others say he's dedicated to DEI\nVicki reported findings & made recommendations to exec ldshp team that included training & IDI\nMight want ldsp training in Singapore.\nVicki Recommended IDI + GlobeSmart or Country Navigator\nMost who've taken the IDI so far are in minimization, but some below & some above\nGlobal head of HR, 2 HR Leaders - who Vicki is working with - one person is very particular\nShe committed to 6 IDIs - debrief + follow up coaching session with each leader (2 sessions)\nShe wants to transfer seamlessly to LCW\nVicki would transfer knowledge, including her findings & recommendations\nNext steps:\nVicki is giving the client our names & will introduce us both hopefully next week\nWe can have a call with the client & Vicki if needed to hand off to us\nI would just be on initial call; you would lead\nWe will schedule a call with Vicki to discuss more in detail\nI know this is a lot. LMK if you have any immediate questions.\nOtherwise, I'll update you once I hear from Vicki.\nThank you!\nNicole\nNicole Barile\n\u00a0\n(She/Her)\nChief Operating Officer\nLCW\nWebsite\n\u00a0\n|\n\u00a0\nTwitter\n\u00a0\n|\n\u00a0\nFacebook\n\u00a0\n|\n\u00a0\nLinkedIn\nView our upcoming events\n\u00a0| \nSign-up for our newsletter",

If you know it's going to be in April please put the last day of April. If you know something's going to happen in Q3 but have no idea when in Q3, please enter the last day of Q3 in the delivery date field.... And so on.\n\u00a0\nShould you have any questions or need help, please lmk and/or put time on my calendar.\nThanks so much for your help with this!\nNicole\n\u00a0\nNicole Barile\n\u00a0\n(She/Her)\nChief Operating Officer\nLCW\n\u00a0\nWebsite\n\u00a0\n|\n\u00a0\nTwitter\n\u00a0\n|\n\u00a0\nFacebook\n\u00a0\n|\n\u00a0\nLinkedIn\nView our upcoming events\n\u00a0| \nSign-up for our newsletter",

I truly value the opportunity to work with LCW in my current role as an external consultant yet being included as part of the FT team in pipeline work past and to come. I very much appreciate your trust in my skill set and beyond.\n\u00a0\nThis is an important decision, and I would like to take the weekend to carefully evaluate the details of the proposal as today January 24\nth\n is my last retainer compensation day.\nBased on offer it will end my 1 year\u00a0 agreement which started end of January 2024 which would have marked a one year anniversary if I were full time. \n\u00a0\n\u00a0\nI\u2019ll provide you with my response by Monday January 27 early morning before any meeting you may have with members of FT team to announce my new status and impact on work load. \n\u00a0\n\u00a0\nThank you for your understanding and the continued opportunity to make a difference.\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\nBest regards,\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\nPatricia M Coleman\u00a0\n(She-Elle-Ella)\nSr Consultant\u00a0\u00a0\nLCW\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\nWebsite\n\u00a0\n|\n\u00a0\nTwitter\n\u00a0\n|\n\u00a0\nFacebook\n\u00a0\n|\n\u00a0\nLinkedIn\nView our upcoming events\n\u00a0| \nSign-up for our newsletter\n\u00a0\nFrom:\n Chuck Adams <c.adams@lcwmail.com> \nSent:\n Thursday, January 23, 2025 7:53 PM\nTo:\n Patricia Coleman <p.coleman@lcwmail.com>\nCc:\n Nicole Barile <n.barile@lcwmail.com>\nSubject:\n Patricia Engagement\n\u00a0\nHi Patricia - Here is a summary of our conversation.\n\u00a0\nPatricia keeps open SOWs & clients below.\u00a0\nFor any open SOWs, she can get 20%\u00a0of the deliverables when we get paid. This would look like:\nAug.2025 - Patricia gets $3,400 when ML billed (Colgate)\nAug.2026 - Patricia gets $3,200 when ML billed (Colgate)\nTBD - Patricia gets $2,160 when Spotlights are billed (Sony)\nFor any new SOWs from these clients, she will get 20% of the SOW (minus COGS).\u00a0\nGrowing the client gets another SOW & 20% from that.\nFor IDIs,\n Individual: \n??? \nGroup: \n???\nFor facilitation\n, Patricia would be expected to lead facilitations on her own SOWs (where appropriate) as part of the 20% payment. LCW could pay her up to $250 per hour for facilitation outside of her own SOWs.\n\u00a0\nPlease let me know if I captured anything incorrectly or incompletely. We will need to talk about UL if they come back in the next few days with the CCLP and Global Forum.\n\u00a0\nChuck Adams\n \n(He/Him)\nChief Executive Officer\nLCW\nOffice: \n+1.773.938.4285\nMobile: +1.630.373.5068\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\nWebsite\n\u00a0\n|\n\u00a0\nTwitter\n \n|\n\u00a0\nFacebook\n\u00a0\n|\n\u00a0\nLinkedIn\nView our upcoming events\n \n| \nSign-up for our newsletter",

If you know it's going to be in April please put the last day of April. If you know something's going to happen in Q3 but have no idea when in Q3, please enter the last day of Q3 in the delivery date field....

I see that tittle is \u201cManaging Bias in Compensation & Recognition\" vs \u201cRewards & Recognition\u201d. The latter came up during our last call. Recognition=Praises, email, public announcements but Rewards= Tangible perks in addition to salary. When discuss goals, objectives and outcomes expected we can confirm. \nI will say we should\u00a0 keep the title as Managing Bias in Rewards & Recogntion\" since internally we usually talk about Rewards & Recognition and not Compensation & Recognition but\u00a0 we will definitely discuss the\u00a0 specific content to be included.\n2.\n\u00a0\u00a0 \nWe spoke about Q1 to work on this ML. Do you have launch date in mind in Q1 or Q2? \nThe sooner the better , so ideally Q1 still not an specific date\n3.\n\u00a0\u00a0 \nWho will benefit from this ML, current employees, or new hire ONLY?

I have never been this sick so I would appreciate your patience with me. I am functional though my ability to speak will be limited until I recover more hopefully sooner rather than later.\u00a0I will reserve my speaking for client meetings and on rest of meetings I will reply in chat unless absolutely necessary to speak.\n\u00a0\nThank you for your understanding & patience. And again please reach out to me if you would like to work with me on adjusting my availability for particular days even if it's just one offs.\n\u00a0\nJuri\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\nGet \nOutlook for iOS",
