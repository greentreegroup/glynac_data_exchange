    "body": "Guess the outcome of this HR legal case \nview this email online\nWorker's Facebook post suggests\u00a0suing his employer. Can he be fired?\nJohn Brown got called in to his HR Manager's office and asked about his recent posts on Facebook. A co-worker was fired and John suggested she sue their employer. The company said John's comments were damaging to the company, violated their social media policy, and he was being terminated - immediately.\nJohn filed an unfair labor practice charge with the National Labor Relations Board. He said his speech rights were violated.\nCan you guess the outcome of this real case?\nHRMorning's \"You Be the Judge\" quizzes let you guess the outcome of cases just like this one.\nThey're relevant legal cases, dramatized and interesting to read.

It said the language prohibiting employees from making social media posts that would damage the company's image was too restrictive and could \"chill\" employees' protected ability to talk about work conditions.\nAnalysis: NLRB wants you to let employees talk\nThe NLRB can overturn terminations by both union and non-union employers, making rulings like this real game-changers for companies' social media policies.\nWhile no employer wants to see their workers trash talking the company or talking about filing a lawsuit, those types of conversations are often protected by law - at least i the eyes of the current NLRB. So it's wise to consider revising policies that restrict those kinds of discussions.\nCite\n: NLRB opinion; Butler Medical Transport LLC and Michael rice and William Lewis Norvell,Nos. 05-CA-094981, 097810, 097854, 7/27/17.\u00a0\nFictionalized for dramatic effect.\nCLICK TO SEE 16 QUIZ TOPICS\n \nTo your success,\nSharon\nand the HRMorning Team\nSharon\n\u00a0from\n \nHRMorning\nPrivacy Policy\n\u00a0|\u00a0\nUnsubscribe\nHRMorning\n\u00a0\nSuccess\nFuel\n\u00a0\n660 American Avenue, Suite 203\u00a0 King of Prussia, PA 19406",
