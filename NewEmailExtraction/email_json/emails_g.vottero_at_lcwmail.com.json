    "body": "February 2025 Issue Campaign: Gender Equality\nTable of Contents\nIssue Brief\nOrganization Profile\nGoalmaker Spotlight\nMember Blogs\nWelcome New Members\nGlobalWA Events\nCommunity Events\nCareers\nDear Grace,\n\u00a0\nThe world is not on track to achieve gender equality by 2030. In practical terms, what does this mean? According to the UN, if current trends continue, over 340 million women and girls will live in extreme poverty by 2030. At the current rate, it will take 300 years to end child marriage, 286 years to change discriminatory laws, and 140 years to achieve equal representation in workplace leadership.\n\u00a0\nOn the flip side, it is \nestimated\n that closing the gender gap would expand the global economy by $7T USD. Education plays a key role in closing the gap. Studies show that educating girls leads to higher wages, improved health outcomes, and stronger economies. Additionally, countries with higher levels of gender equality experience \nlower rates of conflict\n and greater political stability.\n \n\u00a0\nIn these rapidly shifting times for international development, I am inspired by the hard work and dedication of GlobalWA members. The Issue Brief below highlights how our member organizations are closing the gender gap with timely, strategic, and forward-thinking interventions.\n\u00a0\nSincerely,\nElizabeth Stokely,\nExecutive Director\n\u200a\n \nISSUE BRIEF\nGender Equality Proves Indispensable to Global Development\n\u00a0\nSustainable Development Goal 5 stands as a cornerstone of global progress, championing gender equality and the empowerment of women and girls worldwide. Recognizing that gender equality is not only a fundamental human right, but a critical driver of peace, prosperity, and sustainability, the tenets of SDG 5 address the systemic barriers that hinder women and girls from fully participating in society.\n\u00a0\nContinue \u203a\u203a\n\u200a\nORGANIZATION PROFILE\nSustaining Movements, Securing Rights: CAMY Fund\u2019s Decade of Empowering Feminist Youth-Led Change\n\u00a0\nAnniversaries are a perfect time to reflect upon where you\u2019ve been, and where you\u2019re going.\n\u00a0\nAfter mobilizing more than $6 million in funding to support over 100 youth-led organizations across Central America and Mexico, the Central America Youth Fund (CAMY Fund), a program of the \nSeattle International Foundation \n\u00a0(SIF), is celebrating their tenth anniversary\u2014and looking ahead to what\u2019s next.\nContinue \u203a\u203a\n\u200a\nGOALMAKER SPOTLIGHT\nAlice Lemunu \u2013 VOCFINU\n\u00a0\nVoices of Children\u2019s Faith in Northern Uganda, or VOCFINU, a GlobalWA member since 2020, is dedicated to uplifting Northern Uganda's vulnerable populations, especially children, women, and adolescents affected by poverty and post-war hardships.

    "body": "January 30, 2025\n\u00a0\nDear\u00a0Grace,\n\u00a0\nWe are reaching out at a time of unprecedented uncertainty for the global development and humanitarian sectors. Recent executive orders from the U.S. administration have imposed a freeze on foreign aid, halted numerous federal grants, withdrawn from international environmental commitments, and introduced significant restrictions on diversity, equity, inclusion, and accessibility initiatives. These actions have immediate and devastating implications for our collective work to improve lives and strengthen communities around the world.\n \n\u00a0\nThis abrupt policy shift has placed many of our members in crisis. The freeze on USAID funding and other federal grants has triggered\u00a0\nstop-work orders across critical programs\n, jeopardizing food security, global health initiatives, gender equity projects, and climate resilience efforts. From emergency relief operations in conflict zones to long-term development projects that foster sustainable economic growth, these funding cuts are already forcing difficult decisions\u2014shutting down programs, laying off staff, and leaving vulnerable populations without essential services.\n \n\u00a0\nImmediate Impact on Our Members\n\u00a0\nThe consequences of these executive orders are and will be deeply felt across Global Washington\u2019s network:\n\u00a0\nHumanitarian and development programs are grinding to a halt.\n USAID\u2019s funding freeze, coupled with an opaque review process, has left organizations scrambling to secure alternative funding or suspend operations altogether. This affects everything from maternal and child health programs to anti-poverty initiatives and refugee assistance.\nEnvironmental and climate action efforts are in jeopardy.\n The U.S. withdrawal from international agreements and funding freezes on environmental programs severely undermine the fight against climate change, disproportionately impacting communities most vulnerable to its effects.\nInclusive development efforts are under threat.\n\u00a0Restrictions on diversity, equity, inclusion and accessibility funding risk rolling back hard-won progress in equity-driven global development, particularly for women, Indigenous communities, and other historically marginalized groups.\nFor many of our members, this freeze is not just a bureaucratic hurdle\u2014it is an existential crisis. Organizations that have spent years building trust and impact in communities worldwide now face the prospect of shuttering their doors, leaving millions without the support they rely on.\n\u00a0\nWhat Comes Next?\n\u00a0\nThis is not a moment for silence. We must act swiftly and decisively to protect the progress we have made and advocate for the restoration of essential funding. We urge those in the development sector to:\n\u00a0\nJoin us for a closed-door CEO discussion.\u00a0\nWe will be convening a members-only CEO roundtable about the executive orders in the coming weeks. Look out for an invitation to hear from other leaders, share insights, ask questions, and coordinate our collective response.\nAttend the next GlobalWA Communications Collective event.\u00a0\nOur upcoming members-only learning session will ground attendees in inclusive marketing and communications for chaotic times.\nEngage with policymakers.\n\u00a0Advocate for the immediate reinstatement of critical foreign aid and development funding. Contact your representatives and make clear the human cost of these decisions. This\u00a0\ninitiative\n is documenting the impact of the foreign aid stop work order. \nMobilize alternative funding.\n We call on philanthropic foundations, private sector leaders, and global donors to fill funding gaps created by this freeze. Increased private sector engagement will be essential in sustaining programs.\nAmplify the urgency.\n\u00a0Share this message within your networks to ensure that the full impact of these policies is widely understood and that the most affected voices are heard.\nOur Commitment Moving Forward\n\u00a0\nDespite these challenges, we remain steadfast in our mission to support a globally engaged Washington state and to advance solutions that foster equity, sustainability, and human dignity worldwide. We, the global development community,\u00a0\nbelieve in our shared humanity\n\u00a0and understand that a retreat from international assistance hurts us all.\n\u00a0 \nAs we navigate this uncertain landscape, we will continue to provide resources and opportunities for collective action. We urge you to stay engaged, stand in solidarity with affected organizations and with one another, and advocate for the restoration of U.S. leadership in global development.\n\u00a0\nPlease do not hesitate to contact us at\u00a0\ninfo@globalwa.org\n.\n\u00a0\nIn partnership and solidarity,\nElizabeth Stokely\nExecutive Director, Global Washington\n\u200a\nGet to Know Global Washington\nGet involved with \nPangea Giving\nExplore \nMembership\nAttend an \nEvent\nOur Contact Information\nGlobal Washington\n10115 Greenwood Ave N. #142\nSeattle, WA 98133\ninfo@globalwa.org\nhttp://globalwa.org\nUnsubscribe\n\u00a0|\u00a0\nManage email preferences",

I am energized by our members and their work, and am honored to be leading this wonderful organization and supporting our vibrant community.\nAlmost 30 percent of the world\u2019s population, or 2.4 billion people, are moderately or severely food insecure. Though the world is \noff track\n to achieve SDG 2 \u2013 Zero Hunger by 2030, there has been progress. The agricultural finance solutions, climate resilient practices, new mobile platforms, and other innovations illustrated below in our Issue Brief hold promise as effective and sustainable models. \nWe had the pleasure of talking with Neena Joshi, Senior Vice President of Asia Programs at Heifer International, for our Goalmaker feature and learned about how cooperatives can accelerate progress for smallholder farmers. Landesa is our Organization Spotlight this month and highlights the direct relationship between land rights and food security.\nAlso, I look forward to meeting you at GlobalWA\u2019s \n15th Annual Goalmaker Conference\n. Our virtual day will be held on December 3 and our in-person day will be on December 4 at the Microsoft Conference Center. Be sure to register soon!\n\u00a0\nSincerely,\nElizabeth Stokely,\nExecutive Director\n\u200a\nISSUE BRIEF\nThe Methods our Members are Employing to Ensure Food Security\n\u00a0\nBillions of people still lack access to nutritious, safe, and sufficient food. According to \nFAO\n, hunger and food insecurity trends are not yet moving in the right direction to end hunger and food insecurity (SDG Target 2.1) by 2030. Yet progress is being made across many countries, and different agricultural models and practices, growing awareness and practices for developing climate resiliency, and new agricultural finance tools and reforms are proving successful. \n\u00a0\nContinue \u203a\u203a\n\u200a\nORGANIZATION PROFILE\nLandesa\n\u00a0\nLandesa advances pro-poor, gender-sensitive land rights reforms through law and policy tools. These reforms have helped alleviate poverty, reduce hunger, and ease conflict over land for more than 180 million families. Secure rights to land boost agricultural productivity, improve health, nutrition and school enrollment, and have placed billions of dollars in new land wealth in the hands of rural people.\nContinue \u203a\u203a\n\u200a\nGOALMAKER SPOTLIGHT\nStrength in Numbers: How Neena Joshi is Elevating Asia\u2019s Women Farmers\n\u00a0\nHeifer\u2019s new Senior Vice President of Asia Programs, Neena Joshi, is used to being around strong women.\n\u00a0\nBorn and raised in Kathmandu, Joshi\u00a0says her childhood was vibrant and exciting.\n\u00a0\n\u201cI was a typical city girl, that was my life,\u201d Joshi says.\n\u00a0\nContinue \u203a\u203a\n\u200a\nMEMBER BLOGS\n\u00a0\nMercy Corps:\n \nNuanced and Equitable: Mercy Corps\u2019 Approach to Food Security and the Livestock Emissions Debate\n\u00a0\nOpportunity International:\n \nAdapting for Tomorrow: Evolving Support for Smallholders in a Changing World\n\u00a0\nYemen Relief and Reconstruction Foundation:\n \nTackling Child Malnutrition in Yemen\n\u00a0\nWorld Concern:\n \nFood Security & Climate Resilience on the Eroding Coast of Bangladesh\n\u00a0\nGlobal Communities:\n \nWomen Forward: Closing the Gender Gap in Agricultural Productivity\n\u00a0\nPygmy Survival Alliance: \nHow Bwiza Village Taught Us Food Security Is Job No. 1\n\u00a0\nGlobal Partnerships:\n \nInvesting in Access to Healthy Food\n\u200a\nWELCOME NEW MEMBERS\nPlease welcome our newest Global Washington members.

Overall, EIP participants average $399 in income, compared to just $182 for Venezuelan refugees and migrants not enrolled in the program. \u00a0\n\u201cWhat we are seeing is that young people are taking more advantage of all the opportunities EIP has to offer, including degree revalidation, job skills training and entrepreneurship programs, and enrollment in formal financial services,\u201d said Oscar Guzman, EIP\u2019s Chief of Party, who presented the results during a Wednesday webinar.\nWomen getting ahead through EIP\nWith women comprising 76% of the program\u2019s beneficiaries, the results show they are benefiting as well, earning $364 per month versus just $150 for Venezuelan women outside the program. That increased level of pay for women exceeds what men outside of the program are earning and reduces the gender income gap in Peru and Ecuador by 16%.\n\u201cOne of the reasons we focused on assisting women originally was due to the structural challenges they faced in acquiring job training and launching entrepreneurial projects. EIP will continue to make further strides to level the playing field for women moving forward,\u201d said Guzman.\n\u201cIt is important to recognize that actions such as facilitating access to financial services are essential for migrants to have a stable process of economic and social integration in the host country,\u201d said Danielle Spinard, Director of the Regional Migration and Health Office for USAID Peru, who also spoke on Wednesday\u2019s webinar.\nYou can read the entire study, in Spanish, by clicking here\n.\nOriginally launched in 2020 and renewed by USAID for three more years in 2023, the Economic Inclusion Project has assisted more than 160,000 Venezuelan migrants, refugees and local residents to improve living conditions for themselves and their families in a sustainable manner, helping them achieve integration into their host countries.\nWorld Council of Credit Unions (WOCCU) is the apex association for credit unions and other global financial cooperatives.

Education is the path to local and global awareness, critical thinking, and self-actualization. It is a key that unlocks imagination and liberates the intellect. Through education people become empowered to create opportunity and break the cycle of poverty.\nYet, when children are kept out of school to help farm, or because of disasters, conflict or gender discrimination, it is not only the children who suffer, but the communities as well.\nGlobalWA members are aware of these constant and ever-evolving challenges and lean into tried-and-true methods for creating and promoting education, and some have developed inventive solutions.\u00a0\nWe hope you enjoy reading about how our members are supporting SDG 4, Quality Education for all. From micro-loans to mobile schools, our members are exemplary for finding paths to provide education in the communities where they work.\nAnd we hope you will join us on December 3-4 for our \n15th Annual Goalmakers Conference\n. We are working hard to create an unforgettable experience that will educate and inspire! Early Bird tickets are available until October 1.

These challenges are global and unfortunately too common in low- and middle-income countries, especially in rural areas.\nContinue \u203a\u203a\n\u200a\nORGANIZATION PROFILE\nGlobal Reach, Local Impact: How Committee for Children International Expands SEL Worldwide\n\u00a0\nHow does an organization specializing in social emotional wellbeing expand its reach to a global level?\nYou\u2019d think it would take a ton of funding, resources, and people power.

Communities impacted by a lack of access to clean drinking water, proper sanitation infrastructure or an awareness of healthy sanitary practices, are facing disease, malnourishment and problems in other sectors, spilling into education and local markets. To that end, organizations are bringing unique solutions that address the crisis at multiple levels of operation, closing the gap between clean water and at-risk communities. \nContinue \u203a\u203a\n\u200a\nORGANIZATION PROFILE\nJoint Interventions for Ethiopia\u2019s Water Crisis: World Vision partners with the Rotary Foundation\n\u00a0\nFacing the fallout of ongoing armed conflict, impending natural disaster and subsequent resource scarcity is Ethiopia, ranking at 9 out of the top 10 most at-risk countries for humanitarian emergencies on the Independent Rescue Committee\u2019s \n2024 Emergency Watchlist\n. From a three-year drought to overbearing floods in vulnerable regions, rampant food and water insecurity is projected to be on the rise, driven by military tensions and an influx of displaced persons from neighboring states. In Ethiopia, and across Somalia, Kenya, Djibouti and Eretria, an estimated \n20 million people\n are predicted to be in dire need of food and water assistance by UNICEF.\u00a0 \nContinue \u203a\u203a\n\u200a\nGOALMAKER SPOTLIGHT\nIbrahim Ogaram, Food Security and Nutrition Officer, The Hunger Project Uganda\n\u00a0\nThe Hunger Project (THP), a GlobalWA member since 2018, was founded in 1977 with the goal of ending world hunger.

For me, this is an opportunity to foster connectedness among our members and the broader global community of intercultural and DEIB practitioners. To this leadership role, I bring my many years of practical experience as a passionate inclusive intercultural practitioner, along with prior Board roles, active engagement at all USA conferences since 2000, and participation at Global SIETAR events in Asia and Europe. I won\u2019t be coming into this role alone. Each of us already has a part in the on-going evolution of our field, so consider my candidacy as an open invitation to join me in helping to chart SIETAR\u2019s on-going journey, as we navigate the complexities of a polarized world. How will we, as an organization, move boldly into the future, while still honoring the work of those who have brought us to this juncture? We stand on strong shoulders, with exponential potential, especially among the diverse new entrants to our field. My goal is to build a stronger, more visible and responsive organization that continues to co-create opportunities, programs and events that nurture and support our transformational growth. My hope is to embolden our members to lead the field and uplift each other, while we uphold our SIETAR USA intercultural mission, and strengthen our DEIB and Social Justice commitment.\n \n \n \nIn seeking the presidency of the SIETAR USA, my vision is simple: enhance the connectedness, evolution, and transformational growth of our SIETAR USA community.

    "body": "April 2024 \u2013 Refugees\u00a0\nTable of Contents\nIssue Brief\nOrganization Profile\nGoalmaker Spotlight\nMember Blogs\nGlobalWA Events\nCommunity Events\nCareers\nDear Grace,\n\u00a0\nAmidst the violence of recent global events, I am finding hope from Global Washington members providing shelter from the storm for refugees. There are over 110 million refugees and displaced people worldwide, the highest number on record since 1951. However, GlobalWA members provide vital programs, credible advocacy, and build awareness of the plight of refugees at different stages of their journey.\nThe statistics can be overwhelming, but when you read about the effective programs reaching children and families, it brings hope for the future. Here are some programs being provided by GlobalWA members:\n\u00a0\nSafe Passage for Children:\n \nEfforts to support refugee children and families during transit, including providing basic necessities, psychosocial support, and child-friendly spaces.\nShelter and Health:\n Initiatives to provide healthcare, education, and support services to refugees in camps and host communities, addressing their basic needs and long-term well-being.\nRelocation and Resettlement:\n Programs facilitating the relocation and integration of refugees into new communities, including sponsorship programs and evacuation efforts in crisis situations.\nJob Training:\n Efforts to empower refugees through employment opportunities, vocational training, mentorship programs, and tech-focused job training, aiming to help them rebuild their lives and contribute to their new communities.\nPlease also listen to my interview with IRC Washington\u2019s Executive Director Kathleen Morris on the GlobalWA podcast \nhere\n. It is a good reminder that refugees are our neighbors, my kid\u2019s classmates, and part of our thriving communities. It is also important to understand the root causes and why refugees are forced to leave their homes.\u00a0\n \n\u00a0\nUltimately, our GlobalWA members are helping to create a world where refugees feel welcomed, empowered, and embraced as valuable members of the global community.\n\u00a0\nSincerely,\nKristen Dailey\nExecutive Director\n\u200a\nISSUE BRIEF\nCreating a World Where Refugees Feel Welcomed, Empowered, and Embraced\n\u00a0\nThere are more than \n110 million\n refugees and displaced people worldwide \u2013 the highest number on record since the United Nations\u2019 1951 Refugee Convention. That\u2019s 110 million individuals, more than \na third\n of which are children, with unique and usually traumatic stories. But that number \u2013 roughly the population of \nEgypt\n \u2013 becomes so easily dehumanizing, too large to imagine. GlobalWA members are doing incredible work to humanize and protect refugees along their journey, assisting them with basic necessities and psychosocial support from the start and eventually helping them create new lives for themselves around the world. These are some of their stories. \nContinue \u203a\u203a\n\u200a\nORGANIZATION PROFILE\nEmpowering Communities: CARE's Response to the Global Crisis of Internally Displaced People\n\u00a0\nIn her 16 years working with CARE\u2019s Humanitarian Team, Camille Davis has never seen anything so dire as the situation in Gaza.\n\u00a0\n\"And that's because the situation is really so desperate and horrific,\u201d says Davis, who is now the Senior Director of Humanitarian Resource Mobilization and Planning at CARE, an international\u00a0humanitarian organization that\u00a0delivers emergency relief and long-term development\u00a0projects in 109 countries around the world.\nContinue \u203a\u203a\n\u200a\nGOALMAKER SPOTLIGHT\nEmi Mahmoud, UNHCR Ambassador\n\u00a0\n\u201cSo many people who are in some of the worst situations humanly imaginable are the most optimistic and hopeful and resourceful people out there. If we put vulnerable people at the forefront of change and give them even a fraction of the resources that we have, that we throw away in leftover food, or instead of buying a new upgrade on our phone, for example, if we just put aside a little bit of that, it will make a huge difference.\n\u00a0 \n\u201cI see the kids who are in the refugee camps all over the world, and I don't see hatred in them. I don't see them saying things or have feeling things like, \u2018the first thing I'm gonna do when I get out of here is get revenge on the person who kicked me out of my home.\u2019 That's not what refugees say. That's not what I'm seeing. What I'm seeing is: \u2018if I had a moment, if I had a chance, I would go back, I'd rebuild it better. I would make sure nothing like this could happen again. I would help anyone who's displaced, anyone who's a refugee.\u2019\n \n\u00a0\n\u201cThat's the hope for me. Knowing that the people who are the most affected, they themselves want us to move forward into peace, into prosperity, into change.\u201d\n\u00a0\n- Emtithal \u201cEmi\u201d Mahmoud\nContinue \u203a\u203a\n\u200a\nMEMBER BLOGS\n\u00a0\nOperation Snow Leopard:\n \nThe Curious Case of Afghanistan\u2019s Forgotten Parliamentarians\n\u00a0\nChildFund: \nA Continuum of Care for Children on the Move\n\u00a0\nGlobal Communities: \nProtecting Children in Emergencies: Perspectives from Syria and Ukraine\n\u00a0\nInternational Rescue Committee: \nMaking a Difference: The Impact of IRC Seattle Co-Sponsorship Program\n\u00a0\nGlobal Mentorship Initiative: \nWhat is Impact Sourcing and Why It Can Help the Refugee Crisis\n\u00a0\n\u200a\nCOMMUNITY EVENTS\n\u00a0\nApril 29\n\u00a0\nChai for Cancer\n - The Max Foundation - 5:30 pm\n\u00a0\nMay 9\n\u00a0\nMake Way for the Future of Sanitation\n Gates Discovery Center - 5:00 pm\n\u00a0\nMay 10\n\u00a0\nIndia Research Symposium and Reception\n Henry M.

    "body": "You don't often get email from comms@globalwa.org. \nLearn why this is important\n\u200a\nPangea Giving 2024 Grants Announced!\nPangea is a giving circle that provides members direct, thoughtful, and effective ways to engage in trust-based partnerships with grassroots organizations in the Global South to improve the quality of life in their communities.\u00a0\n\u00a0\nEach year, after careful consideration and evaluation, grants are provided to the grant partners based on past performance and future needs. \nNOTE: unsolicited grants are not accepted; they are by invitation only.\n\u00a0\nWe are very excited to announce that this March, \nPangea awarded 17 grant partners a combined total of $118,100\n!\nOur partners in East Africa, Latin America, and SE Asia are doing amazing work and we are proud to be able to continue our support. Below is a list of the partners and grants. \n\u00a0\nThank you to all of you who supported the 2024 Grant Pool through your donations and to the Pod members for cultivating strong partnerships with our grant partners.\nVisit with FORTUNE school, Thailand. Photo: Emily Ho\n\u00a0\nPangea grants, given primarily to small, community-based organizations, have a huge impact. For example:\nIn rural western Kenya, Pangea grants have enabled the Ufanisi Women\u2019s Group to increase their production of sweet potato vines, and experiment with methods of producing enhanced sweet potato products, such as chips and cookies. This year's grant will enable the group to scale up the production of enhanced sweet potato products, establish a market outlet in the nearest large town, and explore other market opportunities with schools, hospitals, and hospitality vendors. The income earned from these cooperative entrepreneurial activities helps the women keep their children in school by paying for fees and uniforms and releasing them from child labor to support the family. \nOn the Thai-Burma border, Pangea grants will enable community organizations to conduct programs that help integrate refugees fleeing Burma into Thai society. This includes teaching the Thai language, educating people about their rights, helping them get work permits, and preparing students to enter Thai schools.\nIn indigenous rural communities in the state of Oaxaca, a Pangea grant will help Musor conduct classes on reproductive health and distribute low-cost reproductive health products, as well as information on legal abortion. In addition, they conduct classes on teen pregnancy, gender-based violence prevention, and other key health issues, such as diabetes.\n\u00a0\n2024 GRANTS\n\u00a0\nPlease visit our \nPangea Giving 2024 Grants Announced!\n post for more complete information on these grant awards.\n\u00a0\nSE Asia Grant Awards\nCambodia Indigenous Women Association (CIWA), Cambodia: \n$8,500\u00a0\nCambodia Indigenous Youth Association (CIYA), Cambodia: \n$8,500\n\u00a0\nFORTUNE, Fang, Chiang Mai province, Thailand: \n$8,700\n\u00a0\nGreen Community Volunteers (\u201cGCV\u201d), Laos: \n$6,100\n\u00a0\nMuditar, Myanmar: \n$6,200\n\u00a0\nVisit our \nSE Asia Grant Partner page\n for more information about these organizations.\n\u00a0\nLatin America Grant Awards\nAsociaci\u00f3n Comunidad la Esperanza (AC Esperanza), Guatemala: \n$2,000\u00a0\nMUSOR A.C., Mexico: \n$10,000\n\u00a0\nTaa\u2019 Pi\u2019t, Guatemala: \n$10,000\u00a0\n \nUNOSJO, Mexico: \n$10,000\n\u00a0\nVisit our \nLatin America Grant Partner page\n for more information about these organizations.\n\u00a0\nEast Africa Grant Awards\nChild Empowerment Program (CEP), Uganda: \n$7,000\u00a0\nEast Africa Leadership Forum, Kenya: \n$4,000\n\u00a0\nEwang\u2019an Olosho Le Suswa (Ewang\u2019an), Kenya: \n$5,000\u00a0\nPlaymaker Theatre, Kenya: \n$4,000\u00a0\nSolidarity Eden Foundation, Uganda: \n$9,000\u00a0\nUfanisi Women\u2019s Group (UWG), Kenya: \n$6,600\n\u00a0\nWomen In Sustainable Enterprise (WISE), Kenya: \n$6,500\n\u00a0\nVisit our \nEast Africa Grant Partner page\n for more information about these organizations.\n\u200a\nWe also have a wonderful \nSE Asia Site Visit Report\n from our visit in February 2024 by SE Asia pod members Emily Ho and Paul Silver.

Before a bullet is fired or a missile launched, there is an exchange of words \u2014 sometimes as a final effort to avert conflict, other times as a catalyst that leads to protracted conflict. In this workshop, we will explore the complex roots of societal conflicts by examining how identity, class, language, and political ideology often evolve into intercultural conflicts. Participants will engage in critical discussions around these issues, identifying their impact on our communities and ourselves. We will unpack ways to create inclusive environments that foster respect for diversity, stimulate dialogue, and nurture empathy. This is an opportunity for participants to reflect on their role in intercultural communication and conflict resolution, both in their personal lives and as members of a global community.\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\nRegistration = FREE for current SIETAR USA members in good standing - use code\n\u00a0\nStorm24\n\u00a0\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nAbout Your Presenter\nFemi \nHiggins\n\u00a0\nFemi Higgins is the Founder and Managing Director of\u00a0\nTangible Culture\n\u00a0and is an Adjunct Professor in the Communications Department at the State University of New York at Oswego.

Before a bullet is fired or a missile launched, there is an exchange of words \u2014 sometimes as a final effort to avert conflict, other times as a catalyst that leads to protracted conflict. In this workshop, we will explore the complex roots of societal conflicts by examining how identity, class, language, and political ideology often evolve into intercultural conflicts. Participants will engage in critical discussions around these issues, identifying their impact on our communities and ourselves. We will unpack ways to create inclusive environments that foster respect for diversity, stimulate dialogue, and nurture empathy. This is an opportunity for participants to reflect on their role in intercultural communication and conflict resolution, both in their personal lives and as members of a global community.\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\nRegistration = FREE for current SIETAR USA members in good standing - use code\n\u00a0\nStorm24\n\u00a0\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nAbout Your Presenter\nFemi \nHiggins\n\u00a0\nFemi Higgins is the Founder and Managing Director of\u00a0\nTangible Culture\n\u00a0and is an Adjunct Professor in the Communications Department at the State University of New York at Oswego.

In this workshop, we will explore the complex roots of societal conflicts by examining how identity, class, language, and political ideology often evolve into intercultural conflicts. Participants will engage in critical discussions around these issues, identifying their impact on our communities and ourselves. We will unpack ways to create inclusive environments that foster respect for diversity, stimulate dialogue, and nurture empathy. This is an opportunity for participants to reflect on their role in intercultural communication and conflict resolution, both in their personal lives and as members of a global community.\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\nRegistration = FREE for current SIETAR USA members in good standing - use code\n\u00a0\nStorm24\n\u00a0\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nAbout Your Presenter\nFemi \nHiggins\n\u00a0\nFemi Higgins is the Founder and Managing Director of\u00a0\nTangible Culture\n\u00a0and is an Adjunct Professor in the Communications Department at the State University of New York at Oswego.

While progress has been made, we are not on track to achieve the targets outlined in the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) by 2030. More must be done. In fact, gender equality is interconnected with, and is the foundation of, numerous SDGs and could unlock the potential to improve lives in low- and middle-income countries.\n\u00a0\nSeveral Global Washington member organizations and Pangea Giving partners are addressing gender equality with multifaceted approaches, such as data disaggregation, primary education of girls, crisis support, food security, financial inclusion, rule of law, health, women in leadership, and advocacy. These efforts aim to empower women and girls, challenge gender norms, and combat violence and discrimination.\n\u00a0\nThere are also several Pangea Giving partners in Africa, Southeast Asia, and Latin America that are working with local communities in rural areas on fundamental aspects of gender equality. You can read more about these grassroots organizations below.\n\u00a0\nLast December, Ghanaian author and advocate Yawa Hansen-Quao spoke about the power of girls when they find their voice to become leaders in their communities. You can watch her presentation \nhere\n from the 2023 Goalmakers Conference and view other recorded sessions from the conference \nhere\n. \n\u00a0\nDespite the work that still must be done, I am hopeful given the determination of Global Washington members and their collective efforts to fight gender inequality. Please learn more about these organizations in the articles below.\n\u00a0\nSincerely,\nKristen Dailey\nExecutive Director\n\u200a\nISSUE BRIEF\nAchieving Gender Equality Through Data, Government, and Communities\n\u00a0\nThe world is not on track to achieve gender equality by \n2030\n. Full stop. According to the \nWorld Economic Forum\n, it will take 131 years at our current rate to reach full parity. That may feel like a daunting figure \u2013 an end we will not see in our lifetimes \u2013 but this should be a cause for further determination, not despair.

You are doing the work that everybody loves. We haven\u2019t heard anybody in the interviews saying that GWLN does not bring value to its members,\u201d said Romana. \u201cYou built something that has immense value, and the question we heard most in our interviews is, \u2018how can we leverage and catalyze this network to go to the next step?\u2019 So, as we close a 15-year window, we open a new one and open new opportunities for the network.\u201d\nSurvey respondents also identified areas they would like to see more of a focus on moving forward, including the need for more structured mentoring, as well as more opportunities to mentor women in emerging markets. \u00a0\u00a0\nInterviews with 23 credit union leaders, WOCCU and WFCU Board Directors and staff, and leaders of credit union service organizations revealed a consensus that there is an opportunity for GWLN to emerge as a global authority in inclusive leadership by:\nExpanding GWLN's mission and updating the structure of Sister Societies to welcome participation from all genders.\nPositioning GWLN as an industry leader in research and data on gender and leadership.\nDeveloping data-driven programs and initiatives to catalyze GWLN.\nProviding training and certifications.\nFor the next step in developing the overall gender strategy, Romana directed those in attendance to answer a three-question survey asking what the specific focus areas of the strategy should be, and how its success can be measured.\n\u201cWithin this network, there is a reservoir of men and women who are willing to roll up their sleeves and help build the next phase of the network and be very creative about it,\u201d said Romana. \u201cAnd I need your help. Because all those topics I shared with you, they\u2019re going to require resources, time and engagement.\u201d\nCelebrating 15 years of GWLN\nSponsored by \nPSCU/Coop Solutions\n, the annual GWLN Luncheon at GAC also featured a look back at the massive growth of the organization over its first 15 years.\nDuring that time, GWLN has engaged more than 6,000 individuals from 90 countries, supported 100 scholarship recipients and launched more than 160 Sister Societies to advance women in leadership.\u00a0\n\u201cYour support helps a lot of different things in this program. It isn\u2019t just about elevating all women, it\u2019s about elevating communities. So, thank you again,\u201d said GWLN Director Eleni Giakoumopoulos.\nSusan Mitchell, who was one of the members of the original WOCCU committee that founded GWLN, encouraged more credit union industry professionals to support the program financially over the next 15 years.\n\u201cAnd what does that do for Global Women? It allows them to create and build resources,\u201d said Mitchell. \u201cSo, think ahead and make commitments out at least three years.\u201d\nStill work to do\nAttendees also learned about the need for GWLN to still do more, after hearing how women still lag behind men in credit unions and the financial services industry as a whole.\nGail Remy-Rajkumar, leader of the Trinidad and Tobago Sister Society, illustrated the leadership gap facing women working at the 129 credit unions in her country.\n\u201cThe share of women working there is 48% to 52% of men. That\u2019s not bad. What is bad is that, in terms of either the President or the Vice-President, it\u2019s just 2% (of women). So, we still have a long way to go,\u201d said Remy-Rajkumar.\nAnd Trinidad and Tobago\u2019s credit unions are not an outlier. External data presented by Romana showed women comprise less than 20% of all C-Suite positions in the financial services industry worldwide.\nWorld Council of Credit Unions is the global trade association and development\u00a0platform for credit unions.

Located near the Russian border in the far northeast of Ukraine, the country\u2019s second-largest city continues to be devastated by Russian bombing.\nTapping dollars Champions generously donated to WFCU\u2019s \nUkrainian Credit Union Displacement Fund\n, the goal of the pilot is to provide liquidity support to boost lending and implement recovery plans, beginning with Kharkiv Credit Union.\nStetsyshyn showed a video of the credit union, which she captured when visiting Kharkiv in January.\n\u201cYou can see a lot of the destruction around, but you can also see the hope. And people hope that they will rebuild and go back to a normal life. And this is what the credit union is giving to their members\u2014hope, that they can support them, even in the most difficult times,\u201d said Stetsyshyn.\nIn a video message, Kharkiv Credit Union CEO Kostiantyn Honcharenko expressed his gratitude for the assistance.\u00a0\n\u201cWe received the funds in late December, and we have already used them to disburse loans, partly to entrepreneurs who are small, but work in the city, provide services and receive income,\u201d said Honcharenko. \u201cAnd we hope that this will be a big moment for us, for the credit union, while for the residents of the city this will be an additional incentive to see that the city is alive and working.\u201d\nBridge the Gap\nHeld each year on the eve of America\u2019s Credit Unions\u2019 Governmental Affairs Conference (GAC), WFCU launched Cooperative Voices in 2022 to give Champions a window into how its Bridge the Gap campaign is helping credit unions bridge gaps in four areas: inclusion, leadership, gender and safety.\nWhile the Ukrainians showed how WFCU is bridging the safety gap, other credit union representatives shared their personal stories to illustrate how the \nGlobal Women\u2019s Leadership Network (GWLN)\n and \nWYCUP\n program are working to bridge the gender and leadership gaps.\nGail Remy-Rajkumar, co-founder of GWLN\u2019s Trinidad and Tobago Sister Society, said the group has been integral in uplifting women in the Caribbean nation.\n\u201cWe have been having programs to educate our young girls. We\u2019ve had forums for emerging women in Trinidad and Tobago. We\u2019ve also had programs to help establish the importance of cooperative principles,\u201d said Remy-Rajkumar.\nTyler Valentine, President and CEO of StagePoint Federal Credit Union in Wyoming, described how his introduction to the WYCUP program at the 2015 World Credit Union Conference in Denver (USA) led to one of the most consequential leadership journeys of his career.\n\u201cIn the weeks following WCUC, together with other young leaders from across the region who attended, we formed the Mountain West Young Credit Union Professionals\u2019 Committee, which I chaired for a number of years,\u201d said Valentine. \u201cYoung people, we really listened to them and asked what they needed from us, from the association and the credit union, to develop their leadership and allow them to get where they want to go.\u201d\nBoth Remy-Rakjumar and Valentine urged the continued support of both GWLN and WYCUP.\nAfrican representatives say international cooperation pays dividends\nChampions were also treated Sunday to remarks by representatives of the African credit union movement on how cooperation with the U.S. credit union system can grow their movement.\nGeorge Ombado, Executive Director of the \nAfrican Confederation of Co-operative Savings and Credit Associations (ACCOSCA)\n, brought a large delegation of credit union representatives and government officials that work in the cooperative sector from both Kenya and Botswana.\nOmbado emphasized that his own collaboration with the U.S. credit union system through its development educators\u2019 (DE) program directly led to the creation of an African DE movement, which is already paying dividends.\n\u201cThis is considered the catalyst of credit union growth and development in the continent. Today, we have more than 100 professionals from 26 countries who have gone through this program. If I may be asked, \u2018is this a turning point for the continent of Africa and the credit union system?\u2019\u2014my answer would be, affirmatively, \u2018yes,\u2019\u201d said Ombado.\nWFCU manages the International Credit Union Development Educators (I-CUDE) program and works with Africa DE, as well as DE programs on other continents to award I-CUDE scholarships each year.\nMike Reuter, WFCU Executive Director, said all the examples presented Sunday night show why the generosity of his Champions is so important to the global credit union movement.\n\u201cFor those who have renewed your support or become a new global champion of World Council of Credit Unions and the Worldwide Foundation, thank you. For those that are with us for the first time, join us in the work of growing our global credit union movement to serve one billion members by 2030,\u201d said Reuter.\nWOCCU partners with WFCU to advance that shared vision of expanding financial inclusion to reach one billion members through a vibrant and growing global credit union system.\u00a0\nIn her closing remarks, WOCCU President and CEO Elissa McCarter LaBorde appealed to those in attendance to follow the lead of the speakers who shared their stories.\n\u201cThey are serving that greater purpose we all share of improving lives through credit unions. As we close out the night, I urge you to continue to join us in this effort,\u201d said McCarter LaBorde.\nThe third annual Cooperative Voices event was\u00a0presented by \nTruStage\n.\nTo learn more about or to donate to WFCU\u2019s Bridge the Gap campaign, \nclick here\n.\u00a0\nWorld Council of Credit Unions is the global trade association and development\u00a0platform for credit unions.

Thus, the work of our Global Washington members to respond and mitigate crises is more important than ever.\n\u00a0\nOur Global Washington members are leveraging advanced technology alongside localized community engagement, which proves to be a powerful approach for building resilience in low- and middle-income countries. Here are some key elements used by GlobalWA members, and read more in the articles following.\nDigital Infrastructure and Software Resilience: \nCompanies like Amazon and Microsoft leverage digital infrastructure, cloud services, disaster mapping, and AI to enhance disaster response, coordination, and prediction.\nCommunity Engagement\n: Organizations like Give2Asia, UNHCR, UNICEF USA, and World Vision emphasize community engagement, education, and empowerment to build resilience from the ground up.\nHumanitarian Aid and Partnerships: \nVarious organizations collaborate with partners, governments, and local communities to provide humanitarian aid, including cash assistance, food security, healthcare, and infrastructure support.\nLong-term Resilience Building\n: Efforts extend beyond immediate relief to include sustainable livelihoods, infrastructure development, and disaster risk reduction to ensure long-term resilience.\nYou can also view the recording of the Goalmaker conference session about this topic \nhere\n and read the \nfull conference report\n online.

Amid a reported \ntenfold increase\n in worldwide climate incidents between 1960 and 2019, predictions estimate a rise of \n1.5C\n in global temperatures within coming decades, leading to greater and more destructive incidences of hurricanes, droughts, wildfires, and heat waves.\nContinue \u203a\u203a\n\u200a\nORGANIZATION PROFILE\nMercy Corps is Helping Ukrainians Feed, Clothe, and Earn for Themselves\n\u00a0\nMercy Corps has been providing international humanitarian aid for over 40 years, much of it in the form of emergency and disaster relief. Of their nearly 6,000 employees, 95% come from within the countries where they work, which is crucial for providing the right aid to the right populations at the right time. Their primary programs help build resiliency by connecting people across the globe to clean water, nutritious food, better economic opportunities, and more peaceful tomorrows\u2014all critical to unlocking the power of human potential and strengthening communities to better cope during crises, adapt to evolving challenges, and thrive into the future. \nContinue \u203a\u203a\n\u200a\nGOALMAKER SPOTLIGHT\nEmpowering Resilience: Cabdinasir Adan\n\u00a0\n\u2018Iskaashato ma kufto\n,\u2019 goes a Somalian proverb: \u201cIf people support each other they do not fall.\u201d It\u2019s a sentiment that Cabdinasir Adan, the Food Security and Livelihoods Manager at \nGargaar Relief and Development Organization (GREDO)\n, can get behind.\n\u00a0\nAccording to Cabdinasir, Somalia faces urgent situations once or twice every year due to frequent droughts, armed conflict and flooding.

The first criteria is to graduate from their home country/regional CUDE program via one of seven national or regional DE programs, including:\u00a0\nAfrica DE\n, operated by the African Confederation of Co-operative Savings & Credit Associations (ACCOSCA).\u00a0\nAsia DE, operated by the \nAssociation of Asian Confederation of Credit Unions\n (ACCU).\u00a0\nCanadaDE\n, operated by the International Centre of Co-op Management (ICCM) at Saint Mary\u2019s University\u00a0\nCaribbean DE (CaribDE).\u00a0\nEuropean DE (DEEU), coordinated by the \nAssociation of British Credit Unions, Ltd.\n (ABCUL)\u00a0\nPhilippines DE, operated by VICTO National.\u00a0\nUnited States DE\n, operated by the National Credit Union Foundation.\u00a0\nBefore applying to obtain the ICUDE designation, applicants must also:\u00a0\nEarn a DE designation from their home DE program.\u00a0\nComplete at least one independent study project that aligns with the learning objectives of the DE program and provide a report of no less than 500 words detailing the project.\u00a0\nEarn a second DE designation by completing a DE program outside of their\u00a0 home country/region.\u00a0\nAttend a World Credit Union Conference or another significant credit union/co-op education and engagement event outside of their home country/region.\u00a0\nOnce an application is received, the applicant\u2019s national or regional CUDE program director will review and confirm their submission meets ICUDE requirements. The application will then be forwarded to Worldwide Foundation for Credit Unions, whose staff will review, select and notify those chosen for ICUDE designation in coordination with CUDE program directors.\u00a0\nThe ICUDE Class of 2024 will be recognized at the \n2024 World Credit Union Conference\n, co-hosted by World Council of Credit Unions and America\u2019s Credit Unions, July 21-24, in Boston, USA.\u00a0\n\u201cThis is a tremendous opportunity for credit union development educators who want to take the next step into the international arena and engage with peers from around the world who are working to solve problems for their credit unions and communities in new and innovative ways. We can\u2019t wait to select the ICUDE Class of 2024 and introduce them to the world this summer,\u201d said Mike Reuter, Executive Director of WFCU.\u00a0\nYou can find out more about the 2024 ICUDE designation criteria and access the application form by clicking\n \nhere\n. \nAll applications are due by April 12, 2024.\u00a0\u00a0\n\u00a0\nThe Worldwide Foundation for Credit Unions, as a strategic partner of the World Council, bridges gaps impacting credit unions' ability to grow and advance financial inclusion worldwide.

To give them feedback on their startup. To teach them about your profession. To consult at night after your long workday. To demo their product. To coach them each week. To teach them yoga or exercise or art or music.\nYes, we should all volunteer to help people who don\u2019t have the means to pay us. However, many of the people who reach out to you on LinkedIn do.\nThe \u201cside hustles\u201d to create another revenue stream in 2022 are now the necessary protection you need in an uncertain economy in 2024.\nJoin me and thousands of others, and \nconnect your Calendly to PayPal or Stripe and start charging for meetings\n (available on the \nStandard subscription plan\n and higher).\nYou don\u2019t need to request people pay for every meeting if you have \nmultiple event types\n that you offer, but reserve one event type with \nPayPal\n or \nStripe\n integrated \u2013 just in case. \nCharge for Meetings\nBack That Event Type Up\nAs you know, Calendly Event Types are how you offer your attendees blocks of time to meet with you (e.g., 30-minute video call, 15-minute in-person visit, 45-minute paid consultation).\nSometimes you need a little backup when coordinating meetings. That\u2019s why we recently expanded \nevent type permissions\n, allowing you to add editors and viewers to your own events \nand\n admin-managed events!\nCollaborators can make event updates that help you deliver the best customer and candidate experience, prepare event types for you to speed up scheduling, and share event links on your behalf for a seamless handoff.\nTry Permissions\nImproved Collective and Round Robin Event Types\nWhen I ask people in companies what their favorite Calendly feature is, they generally say our \ncollaborative scheduling features\n to schedule better together as a team.\nThese team-scheduling pros wanted more, though. Dozens of them emailed asking for the ability to share meetings among groups of coworkers, or what we call \nCollective \nplus\n Round Robin\n.\nAvailable on the \nTeams and Enterprise subscription plans\n, you can now mix and match Collective and Round Robin capabilities to easily get a combination of teammates scheduled. For example, you can improve: \nProduct demos to prospects:\n Set up an event type with an account executive plus one of five rotating sales engineers\nPanel interviews:\n Pair a hiring manager with one of three rotating team leaders plus one of four rotating peers interviewers\nNew customer onboarding calls:\n Include a sales manager who closed the deal plus their assigned customer success manager and one of four rotating technical implementation specialists\nTry Collective and Round Robin\nJoin Your Calendly Community\nHave you ever wanted to \nmeet other Calendly users\n? What about ask them questions? Or answer theirs? We\u2019ve got you covered with the new \nCalendly Community\n, your go-to hub for answers, inspiration, and all things scheduling.\nWhether you\u2019re just getting started making your scheduling more efficient or a seasoned pro, this community has something for you.\nReady to check it out?

Our commitment to bridging gaps remains paramount, but we\u2019ll deliver our work through a refined strategy that emphasizes and encourages collaboration on a global scale. Only by living the cooperative principles can we bring financial services to the 1.4 billion people who woke up without them today.\n\u00a0\nFor many of them, digitized services are an unimaginable luxury\u2014one that would make a profound difference in the economic security and prosperity of their families, businesses, and communities.\u202fWith your support, we are capitalizing programs focused on digitalization, bringing scale to credit unions serving some of the most remote communities.\n\u00a0\nFor others, gender is a barrier to financial wellness. Addressing that is a core concern of our Global Women\u2019s Leadership Network (GWLN). This worldwide sisterhood is informing, educating and inspiring change to create greater financial opportunities for women.\n\u00a0\nElsewhere, daily circumstances can be so perilous that access to financial services is simply untenable. But because of donors like you supporting our Project Storm Break initiative, we\u2019re providing on-the-ground support\u2014in war-torn nations and in communities recovering from devastating natural disasters\u2014helping credit union employees and members recover and rebuild.\n\u00a0\nTo ensure the long-term impact of and scale of this work, we\u2019re also committed to supporting and nurturing the next generation of credit union leaders through the World Young Credit Union Professionals (WYCUP) network.\u00a0\n\u00a0\nThroughout 2024, I intend to engage you\u2014as Worldwide Foundation champions and credit union leaders\u2014more frequently and more openly. I want to source and solicit your feedback and input as valued partners, maximizing our progress, process and impact.\n\u00a0\nThank you all for your continued support. I look forward to taking on this next challenge with all of you.\u202f\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\nSincerely,\nMichael Reuter\nWorldwide Foundation Executive Director\nWorld Council of Credit Unions (WOCCU)\n \n \nA registered charity organization with\nP.O.

The energy was high, and though there were still disasters, conflicts, and climate change affecting the globe, our members and their constituents showed enduring signs of hope and resilience. \n\u00a0\nYou can read about our members\u2019 accomplishments, strategies, and future-thinking in the articles referenced below. We also encourage you to explore our very active \nBlog\n \nsection with more than 30 member Guest Blogs published. Season 1 of our \nGoalmakers Podcast\n culminated with a total of 12 episodes! Along with several event-based episodes we had insightful and inspiring conversations with our members' leaders and experts.\n \n\u00a0\nThe year culminated in the publication of our new \n2024 Global Philanthropy Guide\n, and a very highly praised \nGoalmakers 2023 Annual Conference\n.\n\u00a0\nWe also encourage you to take a look at our \n2024 Editorial Calendar\n to see what is coming up in 2024! If you are a GlobalWA member, please \nlet us know\n if you are interested in being featured in any of the upcoming issues.\n \n\u200a\n \nVisit our \n2023 Year in Review: Re-cap of GlobalWA Issue Campaigns post\n to read more about this past year's issues, or link through to a specific Issue Campaign below:\n\u00a0\nMARCH \u2013 Disabilities and Inclusive Development:\n The words \u201cinclusive development\u201d can spark many concepts within the global development community. The concept of inclusivity as it applies to people with physical or mental disabilities is often overlooked. We discuss in this month\u2019s Issue Campaign how several Global Washington members are providing services, advocating, and changing health systems to improve the lives of people with disabilities. \nRead more \u00bb\n\u00a0\n \nAthletics competition at the Special Olympics Malta Invitational Games 2022.

Increases in gender equality in low- and middle-income countries can improve the pathways and support for quality education for girls. An increase in women in the workforce and leadership position provides powerful examples for the next generation and can spark a cultural shift to increase the value of girls\u2019 education. It also provides the progression from education to jobs that is need for girls to stay within their communities and creates stronger societal cohesion. \nRead more \u00bb\n\u00a0\n\u00a0 \nYoung Indian schoolgirl.

That ethos is evident in our Global Washington members who are creating climate solutions that increase food security and reach the Sustainable Development Goal 2 of Zero Hunger. This includes sustainable and resilient agriculture that are both high-tech and low-tech informed by proven indigenous knowledge. This Issue Brief talks about challenges and innovations from our members. \nRead more \u00bb\n\u00a0\n\u00a0 \nWater irrigation valves on an African farm.

This brought the total number of refugees and displaced people to 108.4 million \u2013 a staggering number of people \u2013 and solutions for support and resettlement are becoming increasingly challenging. Our Issue Campaign describes the programs that are helping refugees to find safe places and services due to the efforts of Global Washington members. \nRead more \u00bb\n\u00a0\n \nAfghan children.

This included an interview with a Pangea Giving grantee, Executive Director Robert Kalulu of Child Empowerment Programme in Uganda; an interview with Pangea board members about the power and importance of site visits; and an article by one of the Pangea founders, Allan Paulson, about the founding and core principles that have guided Pangea since their formation in 2003. \nRead more \u00bb\n\u00a0\n\u00a0 \nThe Pangea team with four mothers with children in Dandelion\u2019s programs.

With global unemployment projected to reach 208 million in 2023, alongside accelerating costs of living, solutions that empower workers with skills and opportunities can not only address the goal of sustainable economic growth, but actively raise underprivileged groups out of poverty. Our Issue Campaign for September spoke to how several of our members are approaching these challenges and the solutions they have implemented. \nRead more \u00bb\n\u00a0 \nEthiopian farmers at market.

Tragically, this will only increase in the coming months with recent wars and long-standing political instability in countries around the world. Critical emergency food relief will be needed as the first step to get communities on a path to food security defined in Sustainable Development Goal 2 of Zero Hunger. We explored these issues in this month's Issue Campaign and exemplified our members\u2019 programs addressing hunger in the communities where they work. \nRead more \u00bb\n\u00a0\n\u00a0 \nChildren eating a meal at their school; Ghana.

Additionally, we were able to publish a small backlog of \nGoalmaker Podcasts\n, including Jennifer Jones, President of Rotary International; Tim Prewitt, President and CEO of The Hunger Project; Surita Sandosham, President and CEO of Heifer International with Randi Hedin, Board Chair for Heifer International; and Anjali Makhija, Trustee and CEO, S.M. Sehgal Foundation.\n \n\u200a\nDECEMBER \u2013 2024 GLOBAL PHILANTHROPY GUIDE:\n In this year\u2019s edition of the Philanthropy Guide, you\u2019ll read stories of non-profit organizations working to educate youth in low- and middle-income countries. However, the value of these programs goes far beyond an academic education for individual students. These organizations provide essential social-emotional learning, health and hygiene, and a safe space that can be a lifeline for youth. In fact, studies show that communities without access to education have an increase in early marriage, forced labor, and child trafficking.\u00a0\n \nThe organizations listed in this Philanthropy Guide are providing that hope for children in Afghanistan, Laos, Bangladesh, Uganda, Brazil, India, Peru, and other regions throughout the world. In addition, at the back of this guide you will find a full directory of Global Washington\u2019s more than 100 members, including descriptions of their work. \nDownload the 2024 Global Philanthropy Guide \u00bb\n \n\u200a\nNOVEMBER 30 + DECEMBER 7 \u2013 2023 GOALMAKERS ANNUAL CONFERENCE:\n Our 2023 Goalmakers Conference was a huge success! The theme resonated with everyone in our GlobalWA community, and the breakout sessions were timely and relevant. Our 29 sessions featured 68 speakers from across the globe. The 300 attendees were engaged throughout the days, both in-person and using our conference app called Whova. The interactions on Whova reflect the community-building and connections that we want to continue throughout the year. The quality of experience for attendees exceeded pre-pandemic levels with the inclusion of a virtual day, an increase in participation from those outside the U.S., and more interactive sessions.

Before I start, I want to thank each of you for not only being amazing Calendly customers, but also the kind suggestions you\u2019ve shared over the past year. It\u2019s \nmessages like these\n that inspire us!\nUpdated Design\nWe\u2019ve always believed a \nclean, simple-to-use design\n sets many scheduling tools apart. However, we can always learn more about \u201cuser experience\u201d by listening to you all.\nAfter dozens of customer interviews, we launched a refreshed Calendly with a convenient sidebar for navigation, more intuitive Event Type editing, and better Availability settings \u2014 while still offering the powerful scheduling capabilities you depend on.\nSpeaking of \nEvent Types\n, long-time users know this is our system for allowing you to make available different blocks of times for your invitees: 30-minute Video Call, 15-Minute Quick Phone Call, 45-Minute In-Person Meeting. (Multiple event types require an \nupgrade to a paid subscription plan\n.) \nEvent Types got even better this year with some updates including the ability to \ncustomize your settings before you share your link\n. Now, there\u2019s less need to create a whole new event type to update settings (e.g., duration, location) for a quick, one-off change. \nTry Out the New UI\nNew Availability Setting: Global Holidays\n\u201cJust in time for the holi\u2026\u201d We have customers all over the world, so I try to be careful and not assume it\u2019s the holiday season for you! But, if you do observe holidays, you\u2019ll really love our \nnew holidays settings\n \u2014 all year long.\nOur default Holidays feature automatically blocks event types on country-specific holidays, providing an easy way to respect cultural and personal commitments. Go to your Availability settings (bottom left-hand section of the navigation), and you\u2019ll now find a new Holidays tab to get started.\nWhile you\u2019re in your \nAvailability settings\n, ensure you still like your \u201cdefault hours\u201d \u2014 or even think about adding another schedule. For example, my default hours for meetings are 9:00 to 5:00 Monday through Friday, but I have a special vacation schedule I can turn on to allow for a meeting on Thursdays. \nTry Holidays\nImproved Collective and Round Robin Event Types\nI love collaborative scheduling, so this is one of my favorite updates of the year!\nHundreds of teams use our \ncollaborative scheduling features\n to schedule better together as coworkers: \nDistribute meeting opportunities with available teammates such as sales or customer-success professionals (\nRound Robin\n feature)\nTeam up with a coworker (hiring manager plus recruiter) to encourage a job candidate to join your company (\nCollective\n feature)\nBut you all wanted more \u2014 and we\u2019re giving it to you: \nCollective \nplus\n Round Robin\n.\nAvailable on the \nTeams and Enterprise subscription plans\n, you can now mix and match Collective and Round Robin capabilities to easily get a combination of teammates scheduled. For example, you can improve: \nProduct demos to prospects\n: Set up an event type with an account executive plus one of five rotating sales engineers\nPanel interviews\n: Pair a hiring manager with one of three rotating team leaders plus one of four rotating peers interviewers\nNew-customer onboarding calls\n: Include a sales manager who closed the deal plus their assigned customer success manager and one of four rotating technical implementation specialists\nTry Collective and Round Robin\nRouting Improvements\nHave you always wanted to \nadd scheduling to your website\n like so many companies did in 2023, yet you\u2019ve yearned for more control over who could book a meeting? And once the customer or recruit booked a meeting, you wished it would route to the right teammate?\nThat\u2019s where \nRouting\n comes in: Now, you can qualify people by asking questions before they book a time, and then route them to the correct person on your team.\nOur marketing and sales customers inspired us to improve Routing by building integrations with their existing tools: \nIntegrate Calendly Routing with your \nHubSpot\n, \nMarketo\n, or \nPardot\n third-party forms (available on our \nTeams plan\n)\nUse our own \nRouting forms\n (\nTeams plan\n) \u2013 if you don\u2019t have a third-party form\nConduct Salesforce CRM lookup\n and account matching (\nEnterprise plan\n)\nExamine \nRouting Analytics\n to track meeting conversion rates and see how forms perform\nSync data back to your marketing-automation system such as Marketo\n to power retargeting campaigns (e.g., if someone fills out a form, but doesn\u2019t book a meeting, trigger an email) (\nTeams plan\n)\nGet Routing\nAnalytics Improvements\nWe aimed our first introduction of \nAnalytics\n at account administrators seeking to understand scheduling trends \u2014 across their team. Now, each person on your team can view their own meeting data in their \npersonal Analytics Dashboard\n. \nAvailable on the \nStandard subscription plan\n, your personal Analytics Dashboard allows you to fine-tune scheduling with \ninsights\n like popular meeting times, top event types, total completed events, and more. \nLearn More\nAccount-Admin Tool Updates\nHave you thanked your account administrator lately? As our thank-you, we\u2019ve recently released a bevy of updates to make their lives easier: \nAdmin Dashboard\n: See organization-wide activity \u2014 pending invites, missing calendar and video conferencing connections, and key event stats \u2014 in one central location. (Available on the \nStandard subscription plan\n)\nUser Profiles\n: Review teammate-specific details, such as their calendar and video integrations, availability, and quick links to their event types, by clicking on a user\u2019s avatar.

As society continues to navigate the realities of systemic racism, Black communities have found ways to cultivate resilience through the use of collective care strategies. This webinar will\u00a0focus specifically on how Black communities utilize collective care in their resilience. We will discuss the use of culturally specific forms of protection, healing, and social support that have contributed\u00a0to\u00a0resilience among\u00a0Black\u00a0youth and adults. Additionally, the importance of allyship in creating a sense of belonging and support outside of\u00a0Black communities will be addressed.\n\u00a0\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nAbout Your Presenter\nDanice Brown, Ph.D.\nDr. Danice Brown is currently a Professor in the Counseling Psychology Graduate Program at Towson University where she serves as the Coordinator of Clinical Training.

As society continues to navigate the realities of systemic racism, Black communities have found ways to cultivate resilience through the use of collective care strategies. This webinar will\u00a0focus specifically on how Black communities utilize collective care in their resilience. We will discuss the use of culturally specific forms of protection, healing, and social support that have contributed\u00a0to\u00a0resilience among\u00a0Black\u00a0youth and adults. Additionally, the importance of allyship in creating a sense of belonging and support outside of\u00a0Black communities will be addressed.\n\u00a0\nRegistration = FREE for current SIETAR USA members in good standing - use code\n\u00a0\nDEC13_WEB\n\u00a0\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nAbout Your Presenter\nDanice Brown, Ph.D.\nDr. Danice Brown is currently a Professor in the Counseling Psychology Graduate Program at Towson University where she serves as the Coordinator of Clinical Training.

I am emailing to discuss inclusion and belonging learning and workshop sessions for CSAA Insurance Group's Enterprise Leadership Team (ELT) in 2024. \n\u00a0\nThis year, the ELT underwent a year-long inclusion and belonging learning path, which included six-month IDI-based coaching and quarterly sessions on equity and leadership, systems thinking, and intercultural conflict style. We want to keep this momentum going and support the ELT in their comfort in advocating and advancing equity and inclusion through discourse, workshops, and training. \n\u00a0\nCan we schedule a meeting to discuss this further? We would like to hear your ideas before we meet so that we can use our time together for deeper discussion and strategy. \n\u00a0\nIf you have any questions, please don't hesitate to reach out. We're excited to hear from you.\n\u00a0\nWarmly, \n\u00a0\nMeShawn \nThis message may contain information, including personally identifiable information that is confidential, privileged, or otherwise legally protected.

Yet, you know what holds some others back? They worry just anyone will find their Calendly, and book a time without qualifying them! That\u2019s what I love about our \nRouting features\n, as they allow you to ask invitees questions before they can book time with you and your team. \nAvailable on the Teams subscription plan and above, \nRouting\n is now improved with Routing Analytics that reveal how your routing forms perform with candidates, clients, and potential customers. Within your \nCalendly Analytics\n, you can now see reports on conversion rates and track scheduling trends coming from your Calendly, HubSpot, Marketo, or Pardot forms. Note: Only account admins and owners can \ncheck out routing analytics\n. \nGet Routing Analytics\nSurvey: How Do You Organize \nYour Professional Contacts?\nGetting more organized is often a priority as we start a new year. When it comes to managing your professional contacts (candidates, clients, and customer leads), we\u2019d love to learn more about how you currently keep track of these relationships. Let us know by taking this \n3-minute survey\n! \nTake the Survey\nWhat Forrester Research Found \nWhen They Studied Calendly\nIf you haven\u2019t checked out \nForrester Research\u2019s study on Calendly\n \u2014 which includes interviews with customers DocuSign, Atlassian, GardaWorld, and Semrush \u2014 you can grab it \nhere\n.\nPersonally, I\u2019ve always enjoyed talking to research analyst firms like Forrester, because they work with thousands of customers who want advice on which tech products to buy. And, as a Calendly employee, they can give me a \u201cvoice of the customer\u201d reality check when I need one! Here are a few things Forrester heard from Calendly\u2019s customers:\n\u201cOne of the pain points was trying to schedule with external clients while keeping their data safely secured. Calendly really supports their existing workflows. I don\u2019t think we have any other tools that do that level of advanced extra routing for a team.\u201d - Atlassian\u2019s Global Collaboration Specialist\n\u201cFirst [added value is] connectivity, [then] ease of access to our calendar so that there was a way that team members could manage their tasks. Another added value is consistency, as we\u2019re delivering our engagement consistently to optimize customer and employee experience along with ease and flexibility.\u201d DocuSign\u2019s VP of Success at Scale\n\u201cWe can definitely say that when a sales rep is involved and has a meeting on the calendar for a renewal, the chances of expansion go up and Calendly definitely plays a part in that.\u201d - Semrush\u2019s Sales Project Manager\n\u201cA couple of years ago, we were at 21 days [in our recruiting process], and then we got it down to 17 days. [Now it is] about 15 and a half days from application to when they\u2019re earning a paycheck.\u201d - GardaWorld\u2019s Senior Director of Talent Acquisition\nThat\u2019s just a sample of what these customers have to say in the report. \nFeel free to download it\n, or read the \nblog post\n if you prefer. \nGet the Report\nAn Even Edgier Extension\nHave you added our \nbrowser extensions\n yet to make your life easier? Join customer Trevor Robinson and thousands of others who use it to quickly grab their scheduling link in their email tool, use our LinkedIn integration, and more!\nAnd, Microsoft Edge users, Calendly\u2019s extension is easier to find than ever before \u2014 no more detours to the Chrome Web Store. Find us with all your other \nEdge Add-ons here\n. If you haven\u2019t had the chance to try our extension yet, it grants you one-click access to Calendly from anywhere on the web, or even from the \nOutlook\n app if that\u2019s where you spend most of your day.\nWe\u2019re also available on \nChrome\n and \nFirefox\n, but if there\u2019s a different browser or application you\u2019d like to see us tackle next, \nreply\n to let us know. \nGet the Edge Extension\nSalesforce Integration Update\nIf you take advantage of the \nno-show status feature\n in Calendly to track meeting attendees, those updates can now sync to Salesforce automatically.
