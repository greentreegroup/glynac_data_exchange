    "body": "February 2025 Issue Campaign: Gender Equality\nTable of Contents\nIssue Brief\nOrganization Profile\nGoalmaker Spotlight\nMember Blogs\nWelcome New Members\nGlobalWA Events\nCommunity Events\nCareers\nDear Grace,\n\u00a0\nThe world is not on track to achieve gender equality by 2030. In practical terms, what does this mean? According to the UN, if current trends continue, over 340 million women and girls will live in extreme poverty by 2030. At the current rate, it will take 300 years to end child marriage, 286 years to change discriminatory laws, and 140 years to achieve equal representation in workplace leadership.\n\u00a0\nOn the flip side, it is \nestimated\n that closing the gender gap would expand the global economy by $7T USD. Education plays a key role in closing the gap. Studies show that educating girls leads to higher wages, improved health outcomes, and stronger economies. Additionally, countries with higher levels of gender equality experience \nlower rates of conflict\n and greater political stability.\n \n\u00a0\nIn these rapidly shifting times for international development, I am inspired by the hard work and dedication of GlobalWA members. The Issue Brief below highlights how our member organizations are closing the gender gap with timely, strategic, and forward-thinking interventions.\n\u00a0\nSincerely,\nElizabeth Stokely,\nExecutive Director\n\u200a\n \nISSUE BRIEF\nGender Equality Proves Indispensable to Global Development\n\u00a0\nSustainable Development Goal 5 stands as a cornerstone of global progress, championing gender equality and the empowerment of women and girls worldwide. Recognizing that gender equality is not only a fundamental human right, but a critical driver of peace, prosperity, and sustainability, the tenets of SDG 5 address the systemic barriers that hinder women and girls from fully participating in society.\n\u00a0\nContinue \u203a\u203a\n\u200a\nORGANIZATION PROFILE\nSustaining Movements, Securing Rights: CAMY Fund\u2019s Decade of Empowering Feminist Youth-Led Change\n\u00a0\nAnniversaries are a perfect time to reflect upon where you\u2019ve been, and where you\u2019re going.\n\u00a0\nAfter mobilizing more than $6 million in funding to support over 100 youth-led organizations across Central America and Mexico, the Central America Youth Fund (CAMY Fund), a program of the \nSeattle International Foundation \n\u00a0(SIF), is celebrating their tenth anniversary\u2014and looking ahead to what\u2019s next.\nContinue \u203a\u203a\n\u200a\nGOALMAKER SPOTLIGHT\nAlice Lemunu \u2013 VOCFINU\n\u00a0\nVoices of Children\u2019s Faith in Northern Uganda, or VOCFINU, a GlobalWA member since 2020, is dedicated to uplifting Northern Uganda's vulnerable populations, especially children, women, and adolescents affected by poverty and post-war hardships.

    "body": "January 30, 2025\n\u00a0\nDear\u00a0Grace,\n\u00a0\nWe are reaching out at a time of unprecedented uncertainty for the global development and humanitarian sectors. Recent executive orders from the U.S. administration have imposed a freeze on foreign aid, halted numerous federal grants, withdrawn from international environmental commitments, and introduced significant restrictions on diversity, equity, inclusion, and accessibility initiatives. These actions have immediate and devastating implications for our collective work to improve lives and strengthen communities around the world.\n \n\u00a0\nThis abrupt policy shift has placed many of our members in crisis. The freeze on USAID funding and other federal grants has triggered\u00a0\nstop-work orders across critical programs\n, jeopardizing food security, global health initiatives, gender equity projects, and climate resilience efforts. From emergency relief operations in conflict zones to long-term development projects that foster sustainable economic growth, these funding cuts are already forcing difficult decisions\u2014shutting down programs, laying off staff, and leaving vulnerable populations without essential services.\n \n\u00a0\nImmediate Impact on Our Members\n\u00a0\nThe consequences of these executive orders are and will be deeply felt across Global Washington\u2019s network:\n\u00a0\nHumanitarian and development programs are grinding to a halt.\n USAID\u2019s funding freeze, coupled with an opaque review process, has left organizations scrambling to secure alternative funding or suspend operations altogether. This affects everything from maternal and child health programs to anti-poverty initiatives and refugee assistance.\nEnvironmental and climate action efforts are in jeopardy.\n The U.S. withdrawal from international agreements and funding freezes on environmental programs severely undermine the fight against climate change, disproportionately impacting communities most vulnerable to its effects.\nInclusive development efforts are under threat.\n\u00a0Restrictions on diversity, equity, inclusion and accessibility funding risk rolling back hard-won progress in equity-driven global development, particularly for women, Indigenous communities, and other historically marginalized groups.\nFor many of our members, this freeze is not just a bureaucratic hurdle\u2014it is an existential crisis. Organizations that have spent years building trust and impact in communities worldwide now face the prospect of shuttering their doors, leaving millions without the support they rely on.\n\u00a0\nWhat Comes Next?\n\u00a0\nThis is not a moment for silence. We must act swiftly and decisively to protect the progress we have made and advocate for the restoration of essential funding. We urge those in the development sector to:\n\u00a0\nJoin us for a closed-door CEO discussion.\u00a0\nWe will be convening a members-only CEO roundtable about the executive orders in the coming weeks. Look out for an invitation to hear from other leaders, share insights, ask questions, and coordinate our collective response.\nAttend the next GlobalWA Communications Collective event.\u00a0\nOur upcoming members-only learning session will ground attendees in inclusive marketing and communications for chaotic times.\nEngage with policymakers.\n\u00a0Advocate for the immediate reinstatement of critical foreign aid and development funding. Contact your representatives and make clear the human cost of these decisions. This\u00a0\ninitiative\n is documenting the impact of the foreign aid stop work order. \nMobilize alternative funding.\n We call on philanthropic foundations, private sector leaders, and global donors to fill funding gaps created by this freeze. Increased private sector engagement will be essential in sustaining programs.\nAmplify the urgency.\n\u00a0Share this message within your networks to ensure that the full impact of these policies is widely understood and that the most affected voices are heard.\nOur Commitment Moving Forward\n\u00a0\nDespite these challenges, we remain steadfast in our mission to support a globally engaged Washington state and to advance solutions that foster equity, sustainability, and human dignity worldwide. We, the global development community,\u00a0\nbelieve in our shared humanity\n\u00a0and understand that a retreat from international assistance hurts us all.\n\u00a0 \nAs we navigate this uncertain landscape, we will continue to provide resources and opportunities for collective action. We urge you to stay engaged, stand in solidarity with affected organizations and with one another, and advocate for the restoration of U.S. leadership in global development.\n\u00a0\nPlease do not hesitate to contact us at\u00a0\ninfo@globalwa.org\n.\n\u00a0\nIn partnership and solidarity,\nElizabeth Stokely\nExecutive Director, Global Washington\n\u200a\nGet to Know Global Washington\nGet involved with \nPangea Giving\nExplore \nMembership\nAttend an \nEvent\nOur Contact Information\nGlobal Washington\n10115 Greenwood Ave N. #142\nSeattle, WA 98133\ninfo@globalwa.org\nhttp://globalwa.org\nUnsubscribe\n\u00a0|\u00a0\nManage email preferences",

I am energized by our members and their work, and am honored to be leading this wonderful organization and supporting our vibrant community.\nAlmost 30 percent of the world\u2019s population, or 2.4 billion people, are moderately or severely food insecure. Though the world is \noff track\n to achieve SDG 2 \u2013 Zero Hunger by 2030, there has been progress. The agricultural finance solutions, climate resilient practices, new mobile platforms, and other innovations illustrated below in our Issue Brief hold promise as effective and sustainable models. \nWe had the pleasure of talking with Neena Joshi, Senior Vice President of Asia Programs at Heifer International, for our Goalmaker feature and learned about how cooperatives can accelerate progress for smallholder farmers. Landesa is our Organization Spotlight this month and highlights the direct relationship between land rights and food security.\nAlso, I look forward to meeting you at GlobalWA\u2019s \n15th Annual Goalmaker Conference\n. Our virtual day will be held on December 3 and our in-person day will be on December 4 at the Microsoft Conference Center. Be sure to register soon!\n\u00a0\nSincerely,\nElizabeth Stokely,\nExecutive Director\n\u200a\nISSUE BRIEF\nThe Methods our Members are Employing to Ensure Food Security\n\u00a0\nBillions of people still lack access to nutritious, safe, and sufficient food. According to \nFAO\n, hunger and food insecurity trends are not yet moving in the right direction to end hunger and food insecurity (SDG Target 2.1) by 2030. Yet progress is being made across many countries, and different agricultural models and practices, growing awareness and practices for developing climate resiliency, and new agricultural finance tools and reforms are proving successful. \n\u00a0\nContinue \u203a\u203a\n\u200a\nORGANIZATION PROFILE\nLandesa\n\u00a0\nLandesa advances pro-poor, gender-sensitive land rights reforms through law and policy tools. These reforms have helped alleviate poverty, reduce hunger, and ease conflict over land for more than 180 million families. Secure rights to land boost agricultural productivity, improve health, nutrition and school enrollment, and have placed billions of dollars in new land wealth in the hands of rural people.\nContinue \u203a\u203a\n\u200a\nGOALMAKER SPOTLIGHT\nStrength in Numbers: How Neena Joshi is Elevating Asia\u2019s Women Farmers\n\u00a0\nHeifer\u2019s new Senior Vice President of Asia Programs, Neena Joshi, is used to being around strong women.\n\u00a0\nBorn and raised in Kathmandu, Joshi\u00a0says her childhood was vibrant and exciting.\n\u00a0\n\u201cI was a typical city girl, that was my life,\u201d Joshi says.\n\u00a0\nContinue \u203a\u203a\n\u200a\nMEMBER BLOGS\n\u00a0\nMercy Corps:\n \nNuanced and Equitable: Mercy Corps\u2019 Approach to Food Security and the Livestock Emissions Debate\n\u00a0\nOpportunity International:\n \nAdapting for Tomorrow: Evolving Support for Smallholders in a Changing World\n\u00a0\nYemen Relief and Reconstruction Foundation:\n \nTackling Child Malnutrition in Yemen\n\u00a0\nWorld Concern:\n \nFood Security & Climate Resilience on the Eroding Coast of Bangladesh\n\u00a0\nGlobal Communities:\n \nWomen Forward: Closing the Gender Gap in Agricultural Productivity\n\u00a0\nPygmy Survival Alliance: \nHow Bwiza Village Taught Us Food Security Is Job No. 1\n\u00a0\nGlobal Partnerships:\n \nInvesting in Access to Healthy Food\n\u200a\nWELCOME NEW MEMBERS\nPlease welcome our newest Global Washington members.

Overall, EIP participants average $399 in income, compared to just $182 for Venezuelan refugees and migrants not enrolled in the program. \u00a0\n\u201cWhat we are seeing is that young people are taking more advantage of all the opportunities EIP has to offer, including degree revalidation, job skills training and entrepreneurship programs, and enrollment in formal financial services,\u201d said Oscar Guzman, EIP\u2019s Chief of Party, who presented the results during a Wednesday webinar.\nWomen getting ahead through EIP\nWith women comprising 76% of the program\u2019s beneficiaries, the results show they are benefiting as well, earning $364 per month versus just $150 for Venezuelan women outside the program. That increased level of pay for women exceeds what men outside of the program are earning and reduces the gender income gap in Peru and Ecuador by 16%.\n\u201cOne of the reasons we focused on assisting women originally was due to the structural challenges they faced in acquiring job training and launching entrepreneurial projects. EIP will continue to make further strides to level the playing field for women moving forward,\u201d said Guzman.\n\u201cIt is important to recognize that actions such as facilitating access to financial services are essential for migrants to have a stable process of economic and social integration in the host country,\u201d said Danielle Spinard, Director of the Regional Migration and Health Office for USAID Peru, who also spoke on Wednesday\u2019s webinar.\nYou can read the entire study, in Spanish, by clicking here\n.\nOriginally launched in 2020 and renewed by USAID for three more years in 2023, the Economic Inclusion Project has assisted more than 160,000 Venezuelan migrants, refugees and local residents to improve living conditions for themselves and their families in a sustainable manner, helping them achieve integration into their host countries.\nWorld Council of Credit Unions (WOCCU) is the apex association for credit unions and other global financial cooperatives.

Education is the path to local and global awareness, critical thinking, and self-actualization. It is a key that unlocks imagination and liberates the intellect. Through education people become empowered to create opportunity and break the cycle of poverty.\nYet, when children are kept out of school to help farm, or because of disasters, conflict or gender discrimination, it is not only the children who suffer, but the communities as well.\nGlobalWA members are aware of these constant and ever-evolving challenges and lean into tried-and-true methods for creating and promoting education, and some have developed inventive solutions.\u00a0\nWe hope you enjoy reading about how our members are supporting SDG 4, Quality Education for all. From micro-loans to mobile schools, our members are exemplary for finding paths to provide education in the communities where they work.\nAnd we hope you will join us on December 3-4 for our \n15th Annual Goalmakers Conference\n. We are working hard to create an unforgettable experience that will educate and inspire! Early Bird tickets are available until October 1. Find out more and register here.\nJane Meseck\nInterim Executive Director\n\u200a\nISSUE BRIEF\nSDG 4 Quality Education\n\u00a0\nSustainable Development Goal 4 states: \nEnsure inclusive and equitable quality education and promote lifelong learning opportunities for all.\nThis can be at times a seemingly insurmountable task when communities need workers in the field, have gender discrimination keeping girls out of school, lack basic teaching and learning materials, or simply do not have a physical space where students and teachers can congregate for the learning experience. These challenges are global and unfortunately too common in low- and middle-income countries, especially in rural areas.\nContinue \u203a\u203a\n\u200a\nORGANIZATION PROFILE\nGlobal Reach, Local Impact: How Committee for Children International Expands SEL Worldwide\n\u00a0\nHow does an organization specializing in social emotional wellbeing expand its reach to a global level?\nYou\u2019d think it would take a ton of funding, resources, and people power.
