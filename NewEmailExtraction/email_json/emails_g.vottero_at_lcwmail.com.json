    "body": "February 2025 Issue Campaign: Gender Equality\nTable of Contents\nIssue Brief\nOrganization Profile\nGoalmaker Spotlight\nMember Blogs\nWelcome New Members\nGlobalWA Events\nCommunity Events\nCareers\nDear Grace,\n\u00a0\nThe world is not on track to achieve gender equality by 2030. In practical terms, what does this mean? According to the UN, if current trends continue, over 340 million women and girls will live in extreme poverty by 2030. At the current rate, it will take 300 years to end child marriage, 286 years to change discriminatory laws, and 140 years to achieve equal representation in workplace leadership.\n\u00a0\nOn the flip side, it is \nestimated\n that closing the gender gap would expand the global economy by $7T USD. Education plays a key role in closing the gap. Studies show that educating girls leads to higher wages, improved health outcomes, and stronger economies. Additionally, countries with higher levels of gender equality experience \nlower rates of conflict\n and greater political stability.\n \n\u00a0\nIn these rapidly shifting times for international development, I am inspired by the hard work and dedication of GlobalWA members. The Issue Brief below highlights how our member organizations are closing the gender gap with timely, strategic, and forward-thinking interventions.\n\u00a0\nSincerely,\nElizabeth Stokely,\nExecutive Director\n\u200a\n \nISSUE BRIEF\nGender Equality Proves Indispensable to Global Development\n\u00a0\nSustainable Development Goal 5 stands as a cornerstone of global progress, championing gender equality and the empowerment of women and girls worldwide. Recognizing that gender equality is not only a fundamental human right, but a critical driver of peace, prosperity, and sustainability, the tenets of SDG 5 address the systemic barriers that hinder women and girls from fully participating in society.\n\u00a0\nContinue \u203a\u203a\n\u200a\nORGANIZATION PROFILE\nSustaining Movements, Securing Rights: CAMY Fund\u2019s Decade of Empowering Feminist Youth-Led Change\n\u00a0\nAnniversaries are a perfect time to reflect upon where you\u2019ve been, and where you\u2019re going.\n\u00a0\nAfter mobilizing more than $6 million in funding to support over 100 youth-led organizations across Central America and Mexico, the Central America Youth Fund (CAMY Fund), a program of the \nSeattle International Foundation \n\u00a0(SIF), is celebrating their tenth anniversary\u2014and looking ahead to what\u2019s next.\nContinue \u203a\u203a\n\u200a\nGOALMAKER SPOTLIGHT\nAlice Lemunu \u2013 VOCFINU\n\u00a0\nVoices of Children\u2019s Faith in Northern Uganda, or VOCFINU, a GlobalWA member since 2020, is dedicated to uplifting Northern Uganda's vulnerable populations, especially children, women, and adolescents affected by poverty and post-war hardships.

    "body": "January 30, 2025\n\u00a0\nDear\u00a0Grace,\n\u00a0\nWe are reaching out at a time of unprecedented uncertainty for the global development and humanitarian sectors. Recent executive orders from the U.S. administration have imposed a freeze on foreign aid, halted numerous federal grants, withdrawn from international environmental commitments, and introduced significant restrictions on diversity, equity, inclusion, and accessibility initiatives. These actions have immediate and devastating implications for our collective work to improve lives and strengthen communities around the world.\n \n\u00a0\nThis abrupt policy shift has placed many of our members in crisis. The freeze on USAID funding and other federal grants has triggered\u00a0\nstop-work orders across critical programs\n, jeopardizing food security, global health initiatives, gender equity projects, and climate resilience efforts. From emergency relief operations in conflict zones to long-term development projects that foster sustainable economic growth, these funding cuts are already forcing difficult decisions\u2014shutting down programs, laying off staff, and leaving vulnerable populations without essential services.\n \n\u00a0\nImmediate Impact on Our Members\n\u00a0\nThe consequences of these executive orders are and will be deeply felt across Global Washington\u2019s network:\n\u00a0\nHumanitarian and development programs are grinding to a halt.\n USAID\u2019s funding freeze, coupled with an opaque review process, has left organizations scrambling to secure alternative funding or suspend operations altogether. This affects everything from maternal and child health programs to anti-poverty initiatives and refugee assistance.\nEnvironmental and climate action efforts are in jeopardy.\n The U.S. withdrawal from international agreements and funding freezes on environmental programs severely undermine the fight against climate change, disproportionately impacting communities most vulnerable to its effects.\nInclusive development efforts are under threat.\n\u00a0Restrictions on diversity, equity, inclusion and accessibility funding risk rolling back hard-won progress in equity-driven global development, particularly for women, Indigenous communities, and other historically marginalized groups.\nFor many of our members, this freeze is not just a bureaucratic hurdle\u2014it is an existential crisis. Organizations that have spent years building trust and impact in communities worldwide now face the prospect of shuttering their doors, leaving millions without the support they rely on.\n\u00a0\nWhat Comes Next?\n\u00a0\nThis is not a moment for silence. We must act swiftly and decisively to protect the progress we have made and advocate for the restoration of essential funding. We urge those in the development sector to:\n\u00a0\nJoin us for a closed-door CEO discussion.\u00a0\nWe will be convening a members-only CEO roundtable about the executive orders in the coming weeks. Look out for an invitation to hear from other leaders, share insights, ask questions, and coordinate our collective response.\nAttend the next GlobalWA Communications Collective event.\u00a0\nOur upcoming members-only learning session will ground attendees in inclusive marketing and communications for chaotic times.\nEngage with policymakers.\n\u00a0Advocate for the immediate reinstatement of critical foreign aid and development funding. Contact your representatives and make clear the human cost of these decisions. This\u00a0\ninitiative\n is documenting the impact of the foreign aid stop work order. \nMobilize alternative funding.\n We call on philanthropic foundations, private sector leaders, and global donors to fill funding gaps created by this freeze. Increased private sector engagement will be essential in sustaining programs.\nAmplify the urgency.\n\u00a0Share this message within your networks to ensure that the full impact of these policies is widely understood and that the most affected voices are heard.\nOur Commitment Moving Forward\n\u00a0\nDespite these challenges, we remain steadfast in our mission to support a globally engaged Washington state and to advance solutions that foster equity, sustainability, and human dignity worldwide. We, the global development community,\u00a0\nbelieve in our shared humanity\n\u00a0and understand that a retreat from international assistance hurts us all.\n\u00a0 \nAs we navigate this uncertain landscape, we will continue to provide resources and opportunities for collective action. We urge you to stay engaged, stand in solidarity with affected organizations and with one another, and advocate for the restoration of U.S. leadership in global development.\n\u00a0\nPlease do not hesitate to contact us at\u00a0\ninfo@globalwa.org\n.\n\u00a0\nIn partnership and solidarity,\nElizabeth Stokely\nExecutive Director, Global Washington\n\u200a\nGet to Know Global Washington\nGet involved with \nPangea Giving\nExplore \nMembership\nAttend an \nEvent\nOur Contact Information\nGlobal Washington\n10115 Greenwood Ave N. #142\nSeattle, WA 98133\ninfo@globalwa.org\nhttp://globalwa.org\nUnsubscribe\n\u00a0|\u00a0\nManage email preferences",

I am energized by our members and their work, and am honored to be leading this wonderful organization and supporting our vibrant community.\nAlmost 30 percent of the world\u2019s population, or 2.4 billion people, are moderately or severely food insecure. Though the world is \noff track\n to achieve SDG 2 \u2013 Zero Hunger by 2030, there has been progress. The agricultural finance solutions, climate resilient practices, new mobile platforms, and other innovations illustrated below in our Issue Brief hold promise as effective and sustainable models. \nWe had the pleasure of talking with Neena Joshi, Senior Vice President of Asia Programs at Heifer International, for our Goalmaker feature and learned about how cooperatives can accelerate progress for smallholder farmers. Landesa is our Organization Spotlight this month and highlights the direct relationship between land rights and food security.\nAlso, I look forward to meeting you at GlobalWA\u2019s \n15th Annual Goalmaker Conference\n. Our virtual day will be held on December 3 and our in-person day will be on December 4 at the Microsoft Conference Center. Be sure to register soon!\n\u00a0\nSincerely,\nElizabeth Stokely,\nExecutive Director\n\u200a\nISSUE BRIEF\nThe Methods our Members are Employing to Ensure Food Security\n\u00a0\nBillions of people still lack access to nutritious, safe, and sufficient food. According to \nFAO\n, hunger and food insecurity trends are not yet moving in the right direction to end hunger and food insecurity (SDG Target 2.1) by 2030. Yet progress is being made across many countries, and different agricultural models and practices, growing awareness and practices for developing climate resiliency, and new agricultural finance tools and reforms are proving successful. \n\u00a0\nContinue \u203a\u203a\n\u200a\nORGANIZATION PROFILE\nLandesa\n\u00a0\nLandesa advances pro-poor, gender-sensitive land rights reforms through law and policy tools. These reforms have helped alleviate poverty, reduce hunger, and ease conflict over land for more than 180 million families. Secure rights to land boost agricultural productivity, improve health, nutrition and school enrollment, and have placed billions of dollars in new land wealth in the hands of rural people.\nContinue \u203a\u203a\n\u200a\nGOALMAKER SPOTLIGHT\nStrength in Numbers: How Neena Joshi is Elevating Asia\u2019s Women Farmers\n\u00a0\nHeifer\u2019s new Senior Vice President of Asia Programs, Neena Joshi, is used to being around strong women.\n\u00a0\nBorn and raised in Kathmandu, Joshi\u00a0says her childhood was vibrant and exciting.\n\u00a0\n\u201cI was a typical city girl, that was my life,\u201d Joshi says.\n\u00a0\nContinue \u203a\u203a\n\u200a\nMEMBER BLOGS\n\u00a0\nMercy Corps:\n \nNuanced and Equitable: Mercy Corps\u2019 Approach to Food Security and the Livestock Emissions Debate\n\u00a0\nOpportunity International:\n \nAdapting for Tomorrow: Evolving Support for Smallholders in a Changing World\n\u00a0\nYemen Relief and Reconstruction Foundation:\n \nTackling Child Malnutrition in Yemen\n\u00a0\nWorld Concern:\n \nFood Security & Climate Resilience on the Eroding Coast of Bangladesh\n\u00a0\nGlobal Communities:\n \nWomen Forward: Closing the Gender Gap in Agricultural Productivity\n\u00a0\nPygmy Survival Alliance: \nHow Bwiza Village Taught Us Food Security Is Job No. 1\n\u00a0\nGlobal Partnerships:\n \nInvesting in Access to Healthy Food\n\u200a\nWELCOME NEW MEMBERS\nPlease welcome our newest Global Washington members.

Overall, EIP participants average $399 in income, compared to just $182 for Venezuelan refugees and migrants not enrolled in the program. \u00a0\n\u201cWhat we are seeing is that young people are taking more advantage of all the opportunities EIP has to offer, including degree revalidation, job skills training and entrepreneurship programs, and enrollment in formal financial services,\u201d said Oscar Guzman, EIP\u2019s Chief of Party, who presented the results during a Wednesday webinar.\nWomen getting ahead through EIP\nWith women comprising 76% of the program\u2019s beneficiaries, the results show they are benefiting as well, earning $364 per month versus just $150 for Venezuelan women outside the program. That increased level of pay for women exceeds what men outside of the program are earning and reduces the gender income gap in Peru and Ecuador by 16%.\n\u201cOne of the reasons we focused on assisting women originally was due to the structural challenges they faced in acquiring job training and launching entrepreneurial projects. EIP will continue to make further strides to level the playing field for women moving forward,\u201d said Guzman.\n\u201cIt is important to recognize that actions such as facilitating access to financial services are essential for migrants to have a stable process of economic and social integration in the host country,\u201d said Danielle Spinard, Director of the Regional Migration and Health Office for USAID Peru, who also spoke on Wednesday\u2019s webinar.\nYou can read the entire study, in Spanish, by clicking here\n.\nOriginally launched in 2020 and renewed by USAID for three more years in 2023, the Economic Inclusion Project has assisted more than 160,000 Venezuelan migrants, refugees and local residents to improve living conditions for themselves and their families in a sustainable manner, helping them achieve integration into their host countries.\nWorld Council of Credit Unions (WOCCU) is the apex association for credit unions and other global financial cooperatives.

Education is the path to local and global awareness, critical thinking, and self-actualization. It is a key that unlocks imagination and liberates the intellect. Through education people become empowered to create opportunity and break the cycle of poverty.\nYet, when children are kept out of school to help farm, or because of disasters, conflict or gender discrimination, it is not only the children who suffer, but the communities as well.\nGlobalWA members are aware of these constant and ever-evolving challenges and lean into tried-and-true methods for creating and promoting education, and some have developed inventive solutions.\u00a0\nWe hope you enjoy reading about how our members are supporting SDG 4, Quality Education for all. From micro-loans to mobile schools, our members are exemplary for finding paths to provide education in the communities where they work.\nAnd we hope you will join us on December 3-4 for our \n15th Annual Goalmakers Conference\n. We are working hard to create an unforgettable experience that will educate and inspire! Early Bird tickets are available until October 1.

These challenges are global and unfortunately too common in low- and middle-income countries, especially in rural areas.\nContinue \u203a\u203a\n\u200a\nORGANIZATION PROFILE\nGlobal Reach, Local Impact: How Committee for Children International Expands SEL Worldwide\n\u00a0\nHow does an organization specializing in social emotional wellbeing expand its reach to a global level?\nYou\u2019d think it would take a ton of funding, resources, and people power.

Communities impacted by a lack of access to clean drinking water, proper sanitation infrastructure or an awareness of healthy sanitary practices, are facing disease, malnourishment and problems in other sectors, spilling into education and local markets. To that end, organizations are bringing unique solutions that address the crisis at multiple levels of operation, closing the gap between clean water and at-risk communities. \nContinue \u203a\u203a\n\u200a\nORGANIZATION PROFILE\nJoint Interventions for Ethiopia\u2019s Water Crisis: World Vision partners with the Rotary Foundation\n\u00a0\nFacing the fallout of ongoing armed conflict, impending natural disaster and subsequent resource scarcity is Ethiopia, ranking at 9 out of the top 10 most at-risk countries for humanitarian emergencies on the Independent Rescue Committee\u2019s \n2024 Emergency Watchlist\n. From a three-year drought to overbearing floods in vulnerable regions, rampant food and water insecurity is projected to be on the rise, driven by military tensions and an influx of displaced persons from neighboring states. In Ethiopia, and across Somalia, Kenya, Djibouti and Eretria, an estimated \n20 million people\n are predicted to be in dire need of food and water assistance by UNICEF.\u00a0 \nContinue \u203a\u203a\n\u200a\nGOALMAKER SPOTLIGHT\nIbrahim Ogaram, Food Security and Nutrition Officer, The Hunger Project Uganda\n\u00a0\nThe Hunger Project (THP), a GlobalWA member since 2018, was founded in 1977 with the goal of ending world hunger.

For me, this is an opportunity to foster connectedness among our members and the broader global community of intercultural and DEIB practitioners. To this leadership role, I bring my many years of practical experience as a passionate inclusive intercultural practitioner, along with prior Board roles, active engagement at all USA conferences since 2000, and participation at Global SIETAR events in Asia and Europe. I won\u2019t be coming into this role alone. Each of us already has a part in the on-going evolution of our field, so consider my candidacy as an open invitation to join me in helping to chart SIETAR\u2019s on-going journey, as we navigate the complexities of a polarized world. How will we, as an organization, move boldly into the future, while still honoring the work of those who have brought us to this juncture? We stand on strong shoulders, with exponential potential, especially among the diverse new entrants to our field. My goal is to build a stronger, more visible and responsive organization that continues to co-create opportunities, programs and events that nurture and support our transformational growth. My hope is to embolden our members to lead the field and uplift each other, while we uphold our SIETAR USA intercultural mission, and strengthen our DEIB and Social Justice commitment.\n \n \n \nIn seeking the presidency of the SIETAR USA, my vision is simple: enhance the connectedness, evolution, and transformational growth of our SIETAR USA community.

    "body": "April 2024 \u2013 Refugees\u00a0\nTable of Contents\nIssue Brief\nOrganization Profile\nGoalmaker Spotlight\nMember Blogs\nGlobalWA Events\nCommunity Events\nCareers\nDear Grace,\n\u00a0\nAmidst the violence of recent global events, I am finding hope from Global Washington members providing shelter from the storm for refugees. There are over 110 million refugees and displaced people worldwide, the highest number on record since 1951. However, GlobalWA members provide vital programs, credible advocacy, and build awareness of the plight of refugees at different stages of their journey.\nThe statistics can be overwhelming, but when you read about the effective programs reaching children and families, it brings hope for the future. Here are some programs being provided by GlobalWA members:\n\u00a0\nSafe Passage for Children:\n \nEfforts to support refugee children and families during transit, including providing basic necessities, psychosocial support, and child-friendly spaces.\nShelter and Health:\n Initiatives to provide healthcare, education, and support services to refugees in camps and host communities, addressing their basic needs and long-term well-being.\nRelocation and Resettlement:\n Programs facilitating the relocation and integration of refugees into new communities, including sponsorship programs and evacuation efforts in crisis situations.\nJob Training:\n Efforts to empower refugees through employment opportunities, vocational training, mentorship programs, and tech-focused job training, aiming to help them rebuild their lives and contribute to their new communities.\nPlease also listen to my interview with IRC Washington\u2019s Executive Director Kathleen Morris on the GlobalWA podcast \nhere\n. It is a good reminder that refugees are our neighbors, my kid\u2019s classmates, and part of our thriving communities. It is also important to understand the root causes and why refugees are forced to leave their homes.\u00a0\n \n\u00a0\nUltimately, our GlobalWA members are helping to create a world where refugees feel welcomed, empowered, and embraced as valuable members of the global community.\n\u00a0\nSincerely,\nKristen Dailey\nExecutive Director\n\u200a\nISSUE BRIEF\nCreating a World Where Refugees Feel Welcomed, Empowered, and Embraced\n\u00a0\nThere are more than \n110 million\n refugees and displaced people worldwide \u2013 the highest number on record since the United Nations\u2019 1951 Refugee Convention. That\u2019s 110 million individuals, more than \na third\n of which are children, with unique and usually traumatic stories. But that number \u2013 roughly the population of \nEgypt\n \u2013 becomes so easily dehumanizing, too large to imagine. GlobalWA members are doing incredible work to humanize and protect refugees along their journey, assisting them with basic necessities and psychosocial support from the start and eventually helping them create new lives for themselves around the world. These are some of their stories. \nContinue \u203a\u203a\n\u200a\nORGANIZATION PROFILE\nEmpowering Communities: CARE's Response to the Global Crisis of Internally Displaced People\n\u00a0\nIn her 16 years working with CARE\u2019s Humanitarian Team, Camille Davis has never seen anything so dire as the situation in Gaza.\n\u00a0\n\"And that's because the situation is really so desperate and horrific,\u201d says Davis, who is now the Senior Director of Humanitarian Resource Mobilization and Planning at CARE, an international\u00a0humanitarian organization that\u00a0delivers emergency relief and long-term development\u00a0projects in 109 countries around the world.\nContinue \u203a\u203a\n\u200a\nGOALMAKER SPOTLIGHT\nEmi Mahmoud, UNHCR Ambassador\n\u00a0\n\u201cSo many people who are in some of the worst situations humanly imaginable are the most optimistic and hopeful and resourceful people out there. If we put vulnerable people at the forefront of change and give them even a fraction of the resources that we have, that we throw away in leftover food, or instead of buying a new upgrade on our phone, for example, if we just put aside a little bit of that, it will make a huge difference.\n\u00a0 \n\u201cI see the kids who are in the refugee camps all over the world, and I don't see hatred in them. I don't see them saying things or have feeling things like, \u2018the first thing I'm gonna do when I get out of here is get revenge on the person who kicked me out of my home.\u2019 That's not what refugees say. That's not what I'm seeing. What I'm seeing is: \u2018if I had a moment, if I had a chance, I would go back, I'd rebuild it better. I would make sure nothing like this could happen again. I would help anyone who's displaced, anyone who's a refugee.\u2019\n \n\u00a0\n\u201cThat's the hope for me. Knowing that the people who are the most affected, they themselves want us to move forward into peace, into prosperity, into change.\u201d\n\u00a0\n- Emtithal \u201cEmi\u201d Mahmoud\nContinue \u203a\u203a\n\u200a\nMEMBER BLOGS\n\u00a0\nOperation Snow Leopard:\n \nThe Curious Case of Afghanistan\u2019s Forgotten Parliamentarians\n\u00a0\nChildFund: \nA Continuum of Care for Children on the Move\n\u00a0\nGlobal Communities: \nProtecting Children in Emergencies: Perspectives from Syria and Ukraine\n\u00a0\nInternational Rescue Committee: \nMaking a Difference: The Impact of IRC Seattle Co-Sponsorship Program\n\u00a0\nGlobal Mentorship Initiative: \nWhat is Impact Sourcing and Why It Can Help the Refugee Crisis\n\u00a0\n\u200a\nCOMMUNITY EVENTS\n\u00a0\nApril 29\n\u00a0\nChai for Cancer\n - The Max Foundation - 5:30 pm\n\u00a0\nMay 9\n\u00a0\nMake Way for the Future of Sanitation\n Gates Discovery Center - 5:00 pm\n\u00a0\nMay 10\n\u00a0\nIndia Research Symposium and Reception\n Henry M.

    "body": "You don't often get email from comms@globalwa.org. \nLearn why this is important\n\u200a\nPangea Giving 2024 Grants Announced!\nPangea is a giving circle that provides members direct, thoughtful, and effective ways to engage in trust-based partnerships with grassroots organizations in the Global South to improve the quality of life in their communities.\u00a0\n\u00a0\nEach year, after careful consideration and evaluation, grants are provided to the grant partners based on past performance and future needs. \nNOTE: unsolicited grants are not accepted; they are by invitation only.\n\u00a0\nWe are very excited to announce that this March, \nPangea awarded 17 grant partners a combined total of $118,100\n!\nOur partners in East Africa, Latin America, and SE Asia are doing amazing work and we are proud to be able to continue our support. Below is a list of the partners and grants. \n\u00a0\nThank you to all of you who supported the 2024 Grant Pool through your donations and to the Pod members for cultivating strong partnerships with our grant partners.\nVisit with FORTUNE school, Thailand. Photo: Emily Ho\n\u00a0\nPangea grants, given primarily to small, community-based organizations, have a huge impact. For example:\nIn rural western Kenya, Pangea grants have enabled the Ufanisi Women\u2019s Group to increase their production of sweet potato vines, and experiment with methods of producing enhanced sweet potato products, such as chips and cookies. This year's grant will enable the group to scale up the production of enhanced sweet potato products, establish a market outlet in the nearest large town, and explore other market opportunities with schools, hospitals, and hospitality vendors. The income earned from these cooperative entrepreneurial activities helps the women keep their children in school by paying for fees and uniforms and releasing them from child labor to support the family. \nOn the Thai-Burma border, Pangea grants will enable community organizations to conduct programs that help integrate refugees fleeing Burma into Thai society. This includes teaching the Thai language, educating people about their rights, helping them get work permits, and preparing students to enter Thai schools.\nIn indigenous rural communities in the state of Oaxaca, a Pangea grant will help Musor conduct classes on reproductive health and distribute low-cost reproductive health products, as well as information on legal abortion. In addition, they conduct classes on teen pregnancy, gender-based violence prevention, and other key health issues, such as diabetes.\n\u00a0\n2024 GRANTS\n\u00a0\nPlease visit our \nPangea Giving 2024 Grants Announced!\n post for more complete information on these grant awards.\n\u00a0\nSE Asia Grant Awards\nCambodia Indigenous Women Association (CIWA), Cambodia: \n$8,500\u00a0\nCambodia Indigenous Youth Association (CIYA), Cambodia: \n$8,500\n\u00a0\nFORTUNE, Fang, Chiang Mai province, Thailand: \n$8,700\n\u00a0\nGreen Community Volunteers (\u201cGCV\u201d), Laos: \n$6,100\n\u00a0\nMuditar, Myanmar: \n$6,200\n\u00a0\nVisit our \nSE Asia Grant Partner page\n for more information about these organizations.\n\u00a0\nLatin America Grant Awards\nAsociaci\u00f3n Comunidad la Esperanza (AC Esperanza), Guatemala: \n$2,000\u00a0\nMUSOR A.C., Mexico: \n$10,000\n\u00a0\nTaa\u2019 Pi\u2019t, Guatemala: \n$10,000\u00a0\n \nUNOSJO, Mexico: \n$10,000\n\u00a0\nVisit our \nLatin America Grant Partner page\n for more information about these organizations.\n\u00a0\nEast Africa Grant Awards\nChild Empowerment Program (CEP), Uganda: \n$7,000\u00a0\nEast Africa Leadership Forum, Kenya: \n$4,000\n\u00a0\nEwang\u2019an Olosho Le Suswa (Ewang\u2019an), Kenya: \n$5,000\u00a0\nPlaymaker Theatre, Kenya: \n$4,000\u00a0\nSolidarity Eden Foundation, Uganda: \n$9,000\u00a0\nUfanisi Women\u2019s Group (UWG), Kenya: \n$6,600\n\u00a0\nWomen In Sustainable Enterprise (WISE), Kenya: \n$6,500\n\u00a0\nVisit our \nEast Africa Grant Partner page\n for more information about these organizations.\n\u200a\nWe also have a wonderful \nSE Asia Site Visit Report\n from our visit in February 2024 by SE Asia pod members Emily Ho and Paul Silver.

Before a bullet is fired or a missile launched, there is an exchange of words \u2014 sometimes as a final effort to avert conflict, other times as a catalyst that leads to protracted conflict. In this workshop, we will explore the complex roots of societal conflicts by examining how identity, class, language, and political ideology often evolve into intercultural conflicts. Participants will engage in critical discussions around these issues, identifying their impact on our communities and ourselves. We will unpack ways to create inclusive environments that foster respect for diversity, stimulate dialogue, and nurture empathy. This is an opportunity for participants to reflect on their role in intercultural communication and conflict resolution, both in their personal lives and as members of a global community.\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\nRegistration = FREE for current SIETAR USA members in good standing - use code\n\u00a0\nStorm24\n\u00a0\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nAbout Your Presenter\nFemi \nHiggins\n\u00a0\nFemi Higgins is the Founder and Managing Director of\u00a0\nTangible Culture\n\u00a0and is an Adjunct Professor in the Communications Department at the State University of New York at Oswego.

Before a bullet is fired or a missile launched, there is an exchange of words \u2014 sometimes as a final effort to avert conflict, other times as a catalyst that leads to protracted conflict. In this workshop, we will explore the complex roots of societal conflicts by examining how identity, class, language, and political ideology often evolve into intercultural conflicts. Participants will engage in critical discussions around these issues, identifying their impact on our communities and ourselves. We will unpack ways to create inclusive environments that foster respect for diversity, stimulate dialogue, and nurture empathy. This is an opportunity for participants to reflect on their role in intercultural communication and conflict resolution, both in their personal lives and as members of a global community.\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\nRegistration = FREE for current SIETAR USA members in good standing - use code\n\u00a0\nStorm24\n\u00a0\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nAbout Your Presenter\nFemi \nHiggins\n\u00a0\nFemi Higgins is the Founder and Managing Director of\u00a0\nTangible Culture\n\u00a0and is an Adjunct Professor in the Communications Department at the State University of New York at Oswego.

In this workshop, we will explore the complex roots of societal conflicts by examining how identity, class, language, and political ideology often evolve into intercultural conflicts. Participants will engage in critical discussions around these issues, identifying their impact on our communities and ourselves. We will unpack ways to create inclusive environments that foster respect for diversity, stimulate dialogue, and nurture empathy. This is an opportunity for participants to reflect on their role in intercultural communication and conflict resolution, both in their personal lives and as members of a global community.\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\nRegistration = FREE for current SIETAR USA members in good standing - use code\n\u00a0\nStorm24\n\u00a0\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nAbout Your Presenter\nFemi \nHiggins\n\u00a0\nFemi Higgins is the Founder and Managing Director of\u00a0\nTangible Culture\n\u00a0and is an Adjunct Professor in the Communications Department at the State University of New York at Oswego.

While progress has been made, we are not on track to achieve the targets outlined in the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) by 2030. More must be done. In fact, gender equality is interconnected with, and is the foundation of, numerous SDGs and could unlock the potential to improve lives in low- and middle-income countries.\n\u00a0\nSeveral Global Washington member organizations and Pangea Giving partners are addressing gender equality with multifaceted approaches, such as data disaggregation, primary education of girls, crisis support, food security, financial inclusion, rule of law, health, women in leadership, and advocacy. These efforts aim to empower women and girls, challenge gender norms, and combat violence and discrimination.\n\u00a0\nThere are also several Pangea Giving partners in Africa, Southeast Asia, and Latin America that are working with local communities in rural areas on fundamental aspects of gender equality. You can read more about these grassroots organizations below.\n\u00a0\nLast December, Ghanaian author and advocate Yawa Hansen-Quao spoke about the power of girls when they find their voice to become leaders in their communities. You can watch her presentation \nhere\n from the 2023 Goalmakers Conference and view other recorded sessions from the conference \nhere\n. \n\u00a0\nDespite the work that still must be done, I am hopeful given the determination of Global Washington members and their collective efforts to fight gender inequality. Please learn more about these organizations in the articles below.\n\u00a0\nSincerely,\nKristen Dailey\nExecutive Director\n\u200a\nISSUE BRIEF\nAchieving Gender Equality Through Data, Government, and Communities\n\u00a0\nThe world is not on track to achieve gender equality by \n2030\n. Full stop. According to the \nWorld Economic Forum\n, it will take 131 years at our current rate to reach full parity. That may feel like a daunting figure \u2013 an end we will not see in our lifetimes \u2013 but this should be a cause for further determination, not despair.

You are doing the work that everybody loves. We haven\u2019t heard anybody in the interviews saying that GWLN does not bring value to its members,\u201d said Romana. \u201cYou built something that has immense value, and the question we heard most in our interviews is, \u2018how can we leverage and catalyze this network to go to the next step?\u2019 So, as we close a 15-year window, we open a new one and open new opportunities for the network.\u201d\nSurvey respondents also identified areas they would like to see more of a focus on moving forward, including the need for more structured mentoring, as well as more opportunities to mentor women in emerging markets. \u00a0\u00a0\nInterviews with 23 credit union leaders, WOCCU and WFCU Board Directors and staff, and leaders of credit union service organizations revealed a consensus that there is an opportunity for GWLN to emerge as a global authority in inclusive leadership by:\nExpanding GWLN's mission and updating the structure of Sister Societies to welcome participation from all genders.\nPositioning GWLN as an industry leader in research and data on gender and leadership.\nDeveloping data-driven programs and initiatives to catalyze GWLN.\nProviding training and certifications.\nFor the next step in developing the overall gender strategy, Romana directed those in attendance to answer a three-question survey asking what the specific focus areas of the strategy should be, and how its success can be measured.\n\u201cWithin this network, there is a reservoir of men and women who are willing to roll up their sleeves and help build the next phase of the network and be very creative about it,\u201d said Romana. \u201cAnd I need your help. Because all those topics I shared with you, they\u2019re going to require resources, time and engagement.\u201d\nCelebrating 15 years of GWLN\nSponsored by \nPSCU/Coop Solutions\n, the annual GWLN Luncheon at GAC also featured a look back at the massive growth of the organization over its first 15 years.\nDuring that time, GWLN has engaged more than 6,000 individuals from 90 countries, supported 100 scholarship recipients and launched more than 160 Sister Societies to advance women in leadership.\u00a0\n\u201cYour support helps a lot of different things in this program. It isn\u2019t just about elevating all women, it\u2019s about elevating communities. So, thank you again,\u201d said GWLN Director Eleni Giakoumopoulos.\nSusan Mitchell, who was one of the members of the original WOCCU committee that founded GWLN, encouraged more credit union industry professionals to support the program financially over the next 15 years.\n\u201cAnd what does that do for Global Women? It allows them to create and build resources,\u201d said Mitchell. \u201cSo, think ahead and make commitments out at least three years.\u201d\nStill work to do\nAttendees also learned about the need for GWLN to still do more, after hearing how women still lag behind men in credit unions and the financial services industry as a whole.\nGail Remy-Rajkumar, leader of the Trinidad and Tobago Sister Society, illustrated the leadership gap facing women working at the 129 credit unions in her country.\n\u201cThe share of women working there is 48% to 52% of men. That\u2019s not bad. What is bad is that, in terms of either the President or the Vice-President, it\u2019s just 2% (of women). So, we still have a long way to go,\u201d said Remy-Rajkumar.\nAnd Trinidad and Tobago\u2019s credit unions are not an outlier. External data presented by Romana showed women comprise less than 20% of all C-Suite positions in the financial services industry worldwide.\nWorld Council of Credit Unions is the global trade association and development\u00a0platform for credit unions.

Located near the Russian border in the far northeast of Ukraine, the country\u2019s second-largest city continues to be devastated by Russian bombing.\nTapping dollars Champions generously donated to WFCU\u2019s \nUkrainian Credit Union Displacement Fund\n, the goal of the pilot is to provide liquidity support to boost lending and implement recovery plans, beginning with Kharkiv Credit Union.\nStetsyshyn showed a video of the credit union, which she captured when visiting Kharkiv in January.\n\u201cYou can see a lot of the destruction around, but you can also see the hope. And people hope that they will rebuild and go back to a normal life. And this is what the credit union is giving to their members\u2014hope, that they can support them, even in the most difficult times,\u201d said Stetsyshyn.\nIn a video message, Kharkiv Credit Union CEO Kostiantyn Honcharenko expressed his gratitude for the assistance.\u00a0\n\u201cWe received the funds in late December, and we have already used them to disburse loans, partly to entrepreneurs who are small, but work in the city, provide services and receive income,\u201d said Honcharenko. \u201cAnd we hope that this will be a big moment for us, for the credit union, while for the residents of the city this will be an additional incentive to see that the city is alive and working.\u201d\nBridge the Gap\nHeld each year on the eve of America\u2019s Credit Unions\u2019 Governmental Affairs Conference (GAC), WFCU launched Cooperative Voices in 2022 to give Champions a window into how its Bridge the Gap campaign is helping credit unions bridge gaps in four areas: inclusion, leadership, gender and safety.\nWhile the Ukrainians showed how WFCU is bridging the safety gap, other credit union representatives shared their personal stories to illustrate how the \nGlobal Women\u2019s Leadership Network (GWLN)\n and \nWYCUP\n program are working to bridge the gender and leadership gaps.\nGail Remy-Rajkumar, co-founder of GWLN\u2019s Trinidad and Tobago Sister Society, said the group has been integral in uplifting women in the Caribbean nation.\n\u201cWe have been having programs to educate our young girls. We\u2019ve had forums for emerging women in Trinidad and Tobago. We\u2019ve also had programs to help establish the importance of cooperative principles,\u201d said Remy-Rajkumar.\nTyler Valentine, President and CEO of StagePoint Federal Credit Union in Wyoming, described how his introduction to the WYCUP program at the 2015 World Credit Union Conference in Denver (USA) led to one of the most consequential leadership journeys of his career.\n\u201cIn the weeks following WCUC, together with other young leaders from across the region who attended, we formed the Mountain West Young Credit Union Professionals\u2019 Committee, which I chaired for a number of years,\u201d said Valentine. \u201cYoung people, we really listened to them and asked what they needed from us, from the association and the credit union, to develop their leadership and allow them to get where they want to go.\u201d\nBoth Remy-Rakjumar and Valentine urged the continued support of both GWLN and WYCUP.\nAfrican representatives say international cooperation pays dividends\nChampions were also treated Sunday to remarks by representatives of the African credit union movement on how cooperation with the U.S. credit union system can grow their movement.\nGeorge Ombado, Executive Director of the \nAfrican Confederation of Co-operative Savings and Credit Associations (ACCOSCA)\n, brought a large delegation of credit union representatives and government officials that work in the cooperative sector from both Kenya and Botswana.\nOmbado emphasized that his own collaboration with the U.S. credit union system through its development educators\u2019 (DE) program directly led to the creation of an African DE movement, which is already paying dividends.\n\u201cThis is considered the catalyst of credit union growth and development in the continent. Today, we have more than 100 professionals from 26 countries who have gone through this program. If I may be asked, \u2018is this a turning point for the continent of Africa and the credit union system?\u2019\u2014my answer would be, affirmatively, \u2018yes,\u2019\u201d said Ombado.\nWFCU manages the International Credit Union Development Educators (I-CUDE) program and works with Africa DE, as well as DE programs on other continents to award I-CUDE scholarships each year.\nMike Reuter, WFCU Executive Director, said all the examples presented Sunday night show why the generosity of his Champions is so important to the global credit union movement.\n\u201cFor those who have renewed your support or become a new global champion of World Council of Credit Unions and the Worldwide Foundation, thank you. For those that are with us for the first time, join us in the work of growing our global credit union movement to serve one billion members by 2030,\u201d said Reuter.\nWOCCU partners with WFCU to advance that shared vision of expanding financial inclusion to reach one billion members through a vibrant and growing global credit union system.\u00a0\nIn her closing remarks, WOCCU President and CEO Elissa McCarter LaBorde appealed to those in attendance to follow the lead of the speakers who shared their stories.\n\u201cThey are serving that greater purpose we all share of improving lives through credit unions. As we close out the night, I urge you to continue to join us in this effort,\u201d said McCarter LaBorde.\nThe third annual Cooperative Voices event was\u00a0presented by \nTruStage\n.\nTo learn more about or to donate to WFCU\u2019s Bridge the Gap campaign, \nclick here\n.\u00a0\nWorld Council of Credit Unions is the global trade association and development\u00a0platform for credit unions.

Thus, the work of our Global Washington members to respond and mitigate crises is more important than ever.\n\u00a0\nOur Global Washington members are leveraging advanced technology alongside localized community engagement, which proves to be a powerful approach for building resilience in low- and middle-income countries. Here are some key elements used by GlobalWA members, and read more in the articles following.\nDigital Infrastructure and Software Resilience: \nCompanies like Amazon and Microsoft leverage digital infrastructure, cloud services, disaster mapping, and AI to enhance disaster response, coordination, and prediction.\nCommunity Engagement\n: Organizations like Give2Asia, UNHCR, UNICEF USA, and World Vision emphasize community engagement, education, and empowerment to build resilience from the ground up.\nHumanitarian Aid and Partnerships: \nVarious organizations collaborate with partners, governments, and local communities to provide humanitarian aid, including cash assistance, food security, healthcare, and infrastructure support.\nLong-term Resilience Building\n: Efforts extend beyond immediate relief to include sustainable livelihoods, infrastructure development, and disaster risk reduction to ensure long-term resilience.\nYou can also view the recording of the Goalmaker conference session about this topic \nhere\n and read the \nfull conference report\n online.

Amid a reported \ntenfold increase\n in worldwide climate incidents between 1960 and 2019, predictions estimate a rise of \n1.5C\n in global temperatures within coming decades, leading to greater and more destructive incidences of hurricanes, droughts, wildfires, and heat waves.\nContinue \u203a\u203a\n\u200a\nORGANIZATION PROFILE\nMercy Corps is Helping Ukrainians Feed, Clothe, and Earn for Themselves\n\u00a0\nMercy Corps has been providing international humanitarian aid for over 40 years, much of it in the form of emergency and disaster relief. Of their nearly 6,000 employees, 95% come from within the countries where they work, which is crucial for providing the right aid to the right populations at the right time. Their primary programs help build resiliency by connecting people across the globe to clean water, nutritious food, better economic opportunities, and more peaceful tomorrows\u2014all critical to unlocking the power of human potential and strengthening communities to better cope during crises, adapt to evolving challenges, and thrive into the future. \nContinue \u203a\u203a\n\u200a\nGOALMAKER SPOTLIGHT\nEmpowering Resilience: Cabdinasir Adan\n\u00a0\n\u2018Iskaashato ma kufto\n,\u2019 goes a Somalian proverb: \u201cIf people support each other they do not fall.\u201d It\u2019s a sentiment that Cabdinasir Adan, the Food Security and Livelihoods Manager at \nGargaar Relief and Development Organization (GREDO)\n, can get behind.\n\u00a0\nAccording to Cabdinasir, Somalia faces urgent situations once or twice every year due to frequent droughts, armed conflict and flooding.

The first criteria is to graduate from their home country/regional CUDE program via one of seven national or regional DE programs, including:\u00a0\nAfrica DE\n, operated by the African Confederation of Co-operative Savings & Credit Associations (ACCOSCA).\u00a0\nAsia DE, operated by the \nAssociation of Asian Confederation of Credit Unions\n (ACCU).\u00a0\nCanadaDE\n, operated by the International Centre of Co-op Management (ICCM) at Saint Mary\u2019s University\u00a0\nCaribbean DE (CaribDE).\u00a0\nEuropean DE (DEEU), coordinated by the \nAssociation of British Credit Unions, Ltd.\n (ABCUL)\u00a0\nPhilippines DE, operated by VICTO National.\u00a0\nUnited States DE\n, operated by the National Credit Union Foundation.\u00a0\nBefore applying to obtain the ICUDE designation, applicants must also:\u00a0\nEarn a DE designation from their home DE program.\u00a0\nComplete at least one independent study project that aligns with the learning objectives of the DE program and provide a report of no less than 500 words detailing the project.\u00a0\nEarn a second DE designation by completing a DE program outside of their\u00a0 home country/region.\u00a0\nAttend a World Credit Union Conference or another significant credit union/co-op education and engagement event outside of their home country/region.\u00a0\nOnce an application is received, the applicant\u2019s national or regional CUDE program director will review and confirm their submission meets ICUDE requirements. The application will then be forwarded to Worldwide Foundation for Credit Unions, whose staff will review, select and notify those chosen for ICUDE designation in coordination with CUDE program directors.\u00a0\nThe ICUDE Class of 2024 will be recognized at the \n2024 World Credit Union Conference\n, co-hosted by World Council of Credit Unions and America\u2019s Credit Unions, July 21-24, in Boston, USA.\u00a0\n\u201cThis is a tremendous opportunity for credit union development educators who want to take the next step into the international arena and engage with peers from around the world who are working to solve problems for their credit unions and communities in new and innovative ways. We can\u2019t wait to select the ICUDE Class of 2024 and introduce them to the world this summer,\u201d said Mike Reuter, Executive Director of WFCU.\u00a0\nYou can find out more about the 2024 ICUDE designation criteria and access the application form by clicking\n \nhere\n. \nAll applications are due by April 12, 2024.\u00a0\u00a0\n\u00a0\nThe Worldwide Foundation for Credit Unions, as a strategic partner of the World Council, bridges gaps impacting credit unions' ability to grow and advance financial inclusion worldwide.

To give them feedback on their startup. To teach them about your profession. To consult at night after your long workday. To demo their product. To coach them each week. To teach them yoga or exercise or art or music.\nYes, we should all volunteer to help people who don\u2019t have the means to pay us. However, many of the people who reach out to you on LinkedIn do.\nThe \u201cside hustles\u201d to create another revenue stream in 2022 are now the necessary protection you need in an uncertain economy in 2024.\nJoin me and thousands of others, and \nconnect your Calendly to PayPal or Stripe and start charging for meetings\n (available on the \nStandard subscription plan\n and higher).\nYou don\u2019t need to request people pay for every meeting if you have \nmultiple event types\n that you offer, but reserve one event type with \nPayPal\n or \nStripe\n integrated \u2013 just in case. \nCharge for Meetings\nBack That Event Type Up\nAs you know, Calendly Event Types are how you offer your attendees blocks of time to meet with you (e.g., 30-minute video call, 15-minute in-person visit, 45-minute paid consultation).\nSometimes you need a little backup when coordinating meetings. That\u2019s why we recently expanded \nevent type permissions\n, allowing you to add editors and viewers to your own events \nand\n admin-managed events!\nCollaborators can make event updates that help you deliver the best customer and candidate experience, prepare event types for you to speed up scheduling, and share event links on your behalf for a seamless handoff.\nTry Permissions\nImproved Collective and Round Robin Event Types\nWhen I ask people in companies what their favorite Calendly feature is, they generally say our \ncollaborative scheduling features\n to schedule better together as a team.\nThese team-scheduling pros wanted more, though. Dozens of them emailed asking for the ability to share meetings among groups of coworkers, or what we call \nCollective \nplus\n Round Robin\n.\nAvailable on the \nTeams and Enterprise subscription plans\n, you can now mix and match Collective and Round Robin capabilities to easily get a combination of teammates scheduled. For example, you can improve: \nProduct demos to prospects:\n Set up an event type with an account executive plus one of five rotating sales engineers\nPanel interviews:\n Pair a hiring manager with one of three rotating team leaders plus one of four rotating peers interviewers\nNew customer onboarding calls:\n Include a sales manager who closed the deal plus their assigned customer success manager and one of four rotating technical implementation specialists\nTry Collective and Round Robin\nJoin Your Calendly Community\nHave you ever wanted to \nmeet other Calendly users\n? What about ask them questions? Or answer theirs? We\u2019ve got you covered with the new \nCalendly Community\n, your go-to hub for answers, inspiration, and all things scheduling.\nWhether you\u2019re just getting started making your scheduling more efficient or a seasoned pro, this community has something for you.\nReady to check it out?

Our commitment to bridging gaps remains paramount, but we\u2019ll deliver our work through a refined strategy that emphasizes and encourages collaboration on a global scale. Only by living the cooperative principles can we bring financial services to the 1.4 billion people who woke up without them today.\n\u00a0\nFor many of them, digitized services are an unimaginable luxury\u2014one that would make a profound difference in the economic security and prosperity of their families, businesses, and communities.\u202fWith your support, we are capitalizing programs focused on digitalization, bringing scale to credit unions serving some of the most remote communities.\n\u00a0\nFor others, gender is a barrier to financial wellness. Addressing that is a core concern of our Global Women\u2019s Leadership Network (GWLN). This worldwide sisterhood is informing, educating and inspiring change to create greater financial opportunities for women.\n\u00a0\nElsewhere, daily circumstances can be so perilous that access to financial services is simply untenable. But because of donors like you supporting our Project Storm Break initiative, we\u2019re providing on-the-ground support\u2014in war-torn nations and in communities recovering from devastating natural disasters\u2014helping credit union employees and members recover and rebuild.\n\u00a0\nTo ensure the long-term impact of and scale of this work, we\u2019re also committed to supporting and nurturing the next generation of credit union leaders through the World Young Credit Union Professionals (WYCUP) network.\u00a0\n\u00a0\nThroughout 2024, I intend to engage you\u2014as Worldwide Foundation champions and credit union leaders\u2014more frequently and more openly. I want to source and solicit your feedback and input as valued partners, maximizing our progress, process and impact.\n\u00a0\nThank you all for your continued support. I look forward to taking on this next challenge with all of you.\u202f\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\nSincerely,\nMichael Reuter\nWorldwide Foundation Executive Director\nWorld Council of Credit Unions (WOCCU)\n \n \nA registered charity organization with\nP.O.

The energy was high, and though there were still disasters, conflicts, and climate change affecting the globe, our members and their constituents showed enduring signs of hope and resilience. \n\u00a0\nYou can read about our members\u2019 accomplishments, strategies, and future-thinking in the articles referenced below. We also encourage you to explore our very active \nBlog\n \nsection with more than 30 member Guest Blogs published. Season 1 of our \nGoalmakers Podcast\n culminated with a total of 12 episodes! Along with several event-based episodes we had insightful and inspiring conversations with our members' leaders and experts.\n \n\u00a0\nThe year culminated in the publication of our new \n2024 Global Philanthropy Guide\n, and a very highly praised \nGoalmakers 2023 Annual Conference\n.\n\u00a0\nWe also encourage you to take a look at our \n2024 Editorial Calendar\n to see what is coming up in 2024! If you are a GlobalWA member, please \nlet us know\n if you are interested in being featured in any of the upcoming issues.\n \n\u200a\n \nVisit our \n2023 Year in Review: Re-cap of GlobalWA Issue Campaigns post\n to read more about this past year's issues, or link through to a specific Issue Campaign below:\n\u00a0\nMARCH \u2013 Disabilities and Inclusive Development:\n The words \u201cinclusive development\u201d can spark many concepts within the global development community. The concept of inclusivity as it applies to people with physical or mental disabilities is often overlooked. We discuss in this month\u2019s Issue Campaign how several Global Washington members are providing services, advocating, and changing health systems to improve the lives of people with disabilities. \nRead more \u00bb\n\u00a0\n \nAthletics competition at the Special Olympics Malta Invitational Games 2022.

Increases in gender equality in low- and middle-income countries can improve the pathways and support for quality education for girls. An increase in women in the workforce and leadership position provides powerful examples for the next generation and can spark a cultural shift to increase the value of girls\u2019 education. It also provides the progression from education to jobs that is need for girls to stay within their communities and creates stronger societal cohesion. \nRead more \u00bb\n\u00a0\n\u00a0 \nYoung Indian schoolgirl.

That ethos is evident in our Global Washington members who are creating climate solutions that increase food security and reach the Sustainable Development Goal 2 of Zero Hunger. This includes sustainable and resilient agriculture that are both high-tech and low-tech informed by proven indigenous knowledge. This Issue Brief talks about challenges and innovations from our members. \nRead more \u00bb\n\u00a0\n\u00a0 \nWater irrigation valves on an African farm.

This brought the total number of refugees and displaced people to 108.4 million \u2013 a staggering number of people \u2013 and solutions for support and resettlement are becoming increasingly challenging. Our Issue Campaign describes the programs that are helping refugees to find safe places and services due to the efforts of Global Washington members. \nRead more \u00bb\n\u00a0\n \nAfghan children.

This included an interview with a Pangea Giving grantee, Executive Director Robert Kalulu of Child Empowerment Programme in Uganda; an interview with Pangea board members about the power and importance of site visits; and an article by one of the Pangea founders, Allan Paulson, about the founding and core principles that have guided Pangea since their formation in 2003. \nRead more \u00bb\n\u00a0\n\u00a0 \nThe Pangea team with four mothers with children in Dandelion\u2019s programs.

With global unemployment projected to reach 208 million in 2023, alongside accelerating costs of living, solutions that empower workers with skills and opportunities can not only address the goal of sustainable economic growth, but actively raise underprivileged groups out of poverty. Our Issue Campaign for September spoke to how several of our members are approaching these challenges and the solutions they have implemented. \nRead more \u00bb\n\u00a0 \nEthiopian farmers at market.

Tragically, this will only increase in the coming months with recent wars and long-standing political instability in countries around the world. Critical emergency food relief will be needed as the first step to get communities on a path to food security defined in Sustainable Development Goal 2 of Zero Hunger. We explored these issues in this month's Issue Campaign and exemplified our members\u2019 programs addressing hunger in the communities where they work. \nRead more \u00bb\n\u00a0\n\u00a0 \nChildren eating a meal at their school; Ghana.

Additionally, we were able to publish a small backlog of \nGoalmaker Podcasts\n, including Jennifer Jones, President of Rotary International; Tim Prewitt, President and CEO of The Hunger Project; Surita Sandosham, President and CEO of Heifer International with Randi Hedin, Board Chair for Heifer International; and Anjali Makhija, Trustee and CEO, S.M. Sehgal Foundation.\n \n\u200a\nDECEMBER \u2013 2024 GLOBAL PHILANTHROPY GUIDE:\n In this year\u2019s edition of the Philanthropy Guide, you\u2019ll read stories of non-profit organizations working to educate youth in low- and middle-income countries. However, the value of these programs goes far beyond an academic education for individual students. These organizations provide essential social-emotional learning, health and hygiene, and a safe space that can be a lifeline for youth. In fact, studies show that communities without access to education have an increase in early marriage, forced labor, and child trafficking.\u00a0\n \nThe organizations listed in this Philanthropy Guide are providing that hope for children in Afghanistan, Laos, Bangladesh, Uganda, Brazil, India, Peru, and other regions throughout the world. In addition, at the back of this guide you will find a full directory of Global Washington\u2019s more than 100 members, including descriptions of their work. \nDownload the 2024 Global Philanthropy Guide \u00bb\n \n\u200a\nNOVEMBER 30 + DECEMBER 7 \u2013 2023 GOALMAKERS ANNUAL CONFERENCE:\n Our 2023 Goalmakers Conference was a huge success! The theme resonated with everyone in our GlobalWA community, and the breakout sessions were timely and relevant. Our 29 sessions featured 68 speakers from across the globe. The 300 attendees were engaged throughout the days, both in-person and using our conference app called Whova. The interactions on Whova reflect the community-building and connections that we want to continue throughout the year. The quality of experience for attendees exceeded pre-pandemic levels with the inclusion of a virtual day, an increase in participation from those outside the U.S., and more interactive sessions.

Before I start, I want to thank each of you for not only being amazing Calendly customers, but also the kind suggestions you\u2019ve shared over the past year. It\u2019s \nmessages like these\n that inspire us!\nUpdated Design\nWe\u2019ve always believed a \nclean, simple-to-use design\n sets many scheduling tools apart. However, we can always learn more about \u201cuser experience\u201d by listening to you all.\nAfter dozens of customer interviews, we launched a refreshed Calendly with a convenient sidebar for navigation, more intuitive Event Type editing, and better Availability settings \u2014 while still offering the powerful scheduling capabilities you depend on.\nSpeaking of \nEvent Types\n, long-time users know this is our system for allowing you to make available different blocks of times for your invitees: 30-minute Video Call, 15-Minute Quick Phone Call, 45-Minute In-Person Meeting. (Multiple event types require an \nupgrade to a paid subscription plan\n.) \nEvent Types got even better this year with some updates including the ability to \ncustomize your settings before you share your link\n. Now, there\u2019s less need to create a whole new event type to update settings (e.g., duration, location) for a quick, one-off change. \nTry Out the New UI\nNew Availability Setting: Global Holidays\n\u201cJust in time for the holi\u2026\u201d We have customers all over the world, so I try to be careful and not assume it\u2019s the holiday season for you! But, if you do observe holidays, you\u2019ll really love our \nnew holidays settings\n \u2014 all year long.\nOur default Holidays feature automatically blocks event types on country-specific holidays, providing an easy way to respect cultural and personal commitments. Go to your Availability settings (bottom left-hand section of the navigation), and you\u2019ll now find a new Holidays tab to get started.\nWhile you\u2019re in your \nAvailability settings\n, ensure you still like your \u201cdefault hours\u201d \u2014 or even think about adding another schedule. For example, my default hours for meetings are 9:00 to 5:00 Monday through Friday, but I have a special vacation schedule I can turn on to allow for a meeting on Thursdays. \nTry Holidays\nImproved Collective and Round Robin Event Types\nI love collaborative scheduling, so this is one of my favorite updates of the year!\nHundreds of teams use our \ncollaborative scheduling features\n to schedule better together as coworkers: \nDistribute meeting opportunities with available teammates such as sales or customer-success professionals (\nRound Robin\n feature)\nTeam up with a coworker (hiring manager plus recruiter) to encourage a job candidate to join your company (\nCollective\n feature)\nBut you all wanted more \u2014 and we\u2019re giving it to you: \nCollective \nplus\n Round Robin\n.\nAvailable on the \nTeams and Enterprise subscription plans\n, you can now mix and match Collective and Round Robin capabilities to easily get a combination of teammates scheduled. For example, you can improve: \nProduct demos to prospects\n: Set up an event type with an account executive plus one of five rotating sales engineers\nPanel interviews\n: Pair a hiring manager with one of three rotating team leaders plus one of four rotating peers interviewers\nNew-customer onboarding calls\n: Include a sales manager who closed the deal plus their assigned customer success manager and one of four rotating technical implementation specialists\nTry Collective and Round Robin\nRouting Improvements\nHave you always wanted to \nadd scheduling to your website\n like so many companies did in 2023, yet you\u2019ve yearned for more control over who could book a meeting? And once the customer or recruit booked a meeting, you wished it would route to the right teammate?\nThat\u2019s where \nRouting\n comes in: Now, you can qualify people by asking questions before they book a time, and then route them to the correct person on your team.\nOur marketing and sales customers inspired us to improve Routing by building integrations with their existing tools: \nIntegrate Calendly Routing with your \nHubSpot\n, \nMarketo\n, or \nPardot\n third-party forms (available on our \nTeams plan\n)\nUse our own \nRouting forms\n (\nTeams plan\n) \u2013 if you don\u2019t have a third-party form\nConduct Salesforce CRM lookup\n and account matching (\nEnterprise plan\n)\nExamine \nRouting Analytics\n to track meeting conversion rates and see how forms perform\nSync data back to your marketing-automation system such as Marketo\n to power retargeting campaigns (e.g., if someone fills out a form, but doesn\u2019t book a meeting, trigger an email) (\nTeams plan\n)\nGet Routing\nAnalytics Improvements\nWe aimed our first introduction of \nAnalytics\n at account administrators seeking to understand scheduling trends \u2014 across their team. Now, each person on your team can view their own meeting data in their \npersonal Analytics Dashboard\n. \nAvailable on the \nStandard subscription plan\n, your personal Analytics Dashboard allows you to fine-tune scheduling with \ninsights\n like popular meeting times, top event types, total completed events, and more. \nLearn More\nAccount-Admin Tool Updates\nHave you thanked your account administrator lately? As our thank-you, we\u2019ve recently released a bevy of updates to make their lives easier: \nAdmin Dashboard\n: See organization-wide activity \u2014 pending invites, missing calendar and video conferencing connections, and key event stats \u2014 in one central location. (Available on the \nStandard subscription plan\n)\nUser Profiles\n: Review teammate-specific details, such as their calendar and video integrations, availability, and quick links to their event types, by clicking on a user\u2019s avatar.

As society continues to navigate the realities of systemic racism, Black communities have found ways to cultivate resilience through the use of collective care strategies. This webinar will\u00a0focus specifically on how Black communities utilize collective care in their resilience. We will discuss the use of culturally specific forms of protection, healing, and social support that have contributed\u00a0to\u00a0resilience among\u00a0Black\u00a0youth and adults. Additionally, the importance of allyship in creating a sense of belonging and support outside of\u00a0Black communities will be addressed.\n\u00a0\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nAbout Your Presenter\nDanice Brown, Ph.D.\nDr. Danice Brown is currently a Professor in the Counseling Psychology Graduate Program at Towson University where she serves as the Coordinator of Clinical Training.

As society continues to navigate the realities of systemic racism, Black communities have found ways to cultivate resilience through the use of collective care strategies. This webinar will\u00a0focus specifically on how Black communities utilize collective care in their resilience. We will discuss the use of culturally specific forms of protection, healing, and social support that have contributed\u00a0to\u00a0resilience among\u00a0Black\u00a0youth and adults. Additionally, the importance of allyship in creating a sense of belonging and support outside of\u00a0Black communities will be addressed.\n\u00a0\nRegistration = FREE for current SIETAR USA members in good standing - use code\n\u00a0\nDEC13_WEB\n\u00a0\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nAbout Your Presenter\nDanice Brown, Ph.D.\nDr. Danice Brown is currently a Professor in the Counseling Psychology Graduate Program at Towson University where she serves as the Coordinator of Clinical Training.

I am emailing to discuss inclusion and belonging learning and workshop sessions for CSAA Insurance Group's Enterprise Leadership Team (ELT) in 2024. \n\u00a0\nThis year, the ELT underwent a year-long inclusion and belonging learning path, which included six-month IDI-based coaching and quarterly sessions on equity and leadership, systems thinking, and intercultural conflict style. We want to keep this momentum going and support the ELT in their comfort in advocating and advancing equity and inclusion through discourse, workshops, and training. \n\u00a0\nCan we schedule a meeting to discuss this further? We would like to hear your ideas before we meet so that we can use our time together for deeper discussion and strategy. \n\u00a0\nIf you have any questions, please don't hesitate to reach out. We're excited to hear from you.\n\u00a0\nWarmly, \n\u00a0\nMeShawn \nThis message may contain information, including personally identifiable information that is confidential, privileged, or otherwise legally protected.

Yet, you know what holds some others back? They worry just anyone will find their Calendly, and book a time without qualifying them! That\u2019s what I love about our \nRouting features\n, as they allow you to ask invitees questions before they can book time with you and your team. \nAvailable on the Teams subscription plan and above, \nRouting\n is now improved with Routing Analytics that reveal how your routing forms perform with candidates, clients, and potential customers. Within your \nCalendly Analytics\n, you can now see reports on conversion rates and track scheduling trends coming from your Calendly, HubSpot, Marketo, or Pardot forms. Note: Only account admins and owners can \ncheck out routing analytics\n. \nGet Routing Analytics\nSurvey: How Do You Organize \nYour Professional Contacts?\nGetting more organized is often a priority as we start a new year. When it comes to managing your professional contacts (candidates, clients, and customer leads), we\u2019d love to learn more about how you currently keep track of these relationships. Let us know by taking this \n3-minute survey\n! \nTake the Survey\nWhat Forrester Research Found \nWhen They Studied Calendly\nIf you haven\u2019t checked out \nForrester Research\u2019s study on Calendly\n \u2014 which includes interviews with customers DocuSign, Atlassian, GardaWorld, and Semrush \u2014 you can grab it \nhere\n.\nPersonally, I\u2019ve always enjoyed talking to research analyst firms like Forrester, because they work with thousands of customers who want advice on which tech products to buy. And, as a Calendly employee, they can give me a \u201cvoice of the customer\u201d reality check when I need one! Here are a few things Forrester heard from Calendly\u2019s customers:\n\u201cOne of the pain points was trying to schedule with external clients while keeping their data safely secured. Calendly really supports their existing workflows. I don\u2019t think we have any other tools that do that level of advanced extra routing for a team.\u201d - Atlassian\u2019s Global Collaboration Specialist\n\u201cFirst [added value is] connectivity, [then] ease of access to our calendar so that there was a way that team members could manage their tasks. Another added value is consistency, as we\u2019re delivering our engagement consistently to optimize customer and employee experience along with ease and flexibility.\u201d DocuSign\u2019s VP of Success at Scale\n\u201cWe can definitely say that when a sales rep is involved and has a meeting on the calendar for a renewal, the chances of expansion go up and Calendly definitely plays a part in that.\u201d - Semrush\u2019s Sales Project Manager\n\u201cA couple of years ago, we were at 21 days [in our recruiting process], and then we got it down to 17 days. [Now it is] about 15 and a half days from application to when they\u2019re earning a paycheck.\u201d - GardaWorld\u2019s Senior Director of Talent Acquisition\nThat\u2019s just a sample of what these customers have to say in the report. \nFeel free to download it\n, or read the \nblog post\n if you prefer. \nGet the Report\nAn Even Edgier Extension\nHave you added our \nbrowser extensions\n yet to make your life easier? Join customer Trevor Robinson and thousands of others who use it to quickly grab their scheduling link in their email tool, use our LinkedIn integration, and more!\nAnd, Microsoft Edge users, Calendly\u2019s extension is easier to find than ever before \u2014 no more detours to the Chrome Web Store. Find us with all your other \nEdge Add-ons here\n. If you haven\u2019t had the chance to try our extension yet, it grants you one-click access to Calendly from anywhere on the web, or even from the \nOutlook\n app if that\u2019s where you spend most of your day.\nWe\u2019re also available on \nChrome\n and \nFirefox\n, but if there\u2019s a different browser or application you\u2019d like to see us tackle next, \nreply\n to let us know. \nGet the Edge Extension\nSalesforce Integration Update\nIf you take advantage of the \nno-show status feature\n in Calendly to track meeting attendees, those updates can now sync to Salesforce automatically. This feature requires the \nlatest version of the Salesforce integration package (2.6)\n and manual enablement of the no-show flow template in Salesforce. \nLearn More\nAdditional Resources\nWebinar: \nHow to Use Calendly to Close More Deals\n \nReport: \nTotal Economic Impact of Calendly by Forrester Research\n \nWebinar: \nGetting Started with Calendly\n \nWebinar: \nHow Teams Use Calendly\n \nThanks for reading,\u00a0\nJeff Hardison\nHead of Product Marketing\u00a0@ Calendly\nNeed help?\n \u00a0\nHelp Center\n \u200c | \u200c \nPricing & FAQs\n \u200c | \u200c \nContact Us\n\u00a0\nMore than a scheduling link.\n \n \n \n \n \n115 E.

We will discuss the use of culturally specific forms of protection, healing, and social support that have contributed\u00a0to\u00a0resilience among\u00a0Black\u00a0youth and adults. Additionally, the importance of allyship in creating a sense of belonging and support outside of\u00a0Black communities will be addressed.\n\u00a0\nRegistration = FREE for current SIETAR USA members in good standing - use code\n\u00a0\nDEC13_WEB\n\u00a0\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nAbout Your Presenter\nDanice Brown, Ph.D.\nDr. Danice Brown is currently a Professor in the Counseling Psychology Graduate Program at Towson University where she serves as the Coordinator of Clinical Training.

The GWLN scholarship includes airfare, hotel and registration fees for 2024 WCUC.\nSince 2009, GWLN has awarded \n100 scholarships\n to women leaders in the credit union community from over 30 countries. These annual awards recognize individuals who have demonstrated leadership and exemplify a commitment to improving lives through financial cooperatives.\nScholars will connect with the heart of the global credit union movement during five (5) full days of learning, networking and exchange. The 2024 scholars will participate in all GWLN events, connect with scholarship supporters, GWLN members and Sister Society leaders while engaging with conference attendees throughout WCUC. Focusing on professional development, scholars evolve through interactive dialogue sessions, expanding their knowledge and growing professional relationships at the conference.\n\u201cI was drawn to GWLN because of its mission to create a more equitable world, where women have equal access to opportunities and resources as their male counterparts. As someone who is passionate about women's leadership and gender equity, GWLN is offering a meaningful and impactful way for me to get involved and make a difference,\u201d said Naddian Abraham-Damier, a 2023 scholar, who attended the World Credit Union Conference in Vancouver, Canada.\nScholarships are made possible through funding from GWLN memberships and industry champion sponsorships. In 2023, sponsors included \nCo-op Solutions\n,\u00a0\nTruStage\n,\u00a0\nOrigence\n, \nPSCU\n\u00a0and the Susan Adams Scholarship Fund which was established in honor of former Entrust Financial Credit Union CEO Susan Adams supported by\u00a0\nOne AZ Credit Union\n.\n\u201cGWLN will be celebrating 15 years in 2024, and it\u2019s an exciting time for the network. The annual scholarship program is essential to our work for women\u2019s advancement to leadership in our global movement. We have seen the tremendous impact the scholars have made for women in their credit unions and communities. We must continue our collective efforts in growing the program,\u201d said\u00a0Lena Giakoumopoulos, GWLN Director.\nThe scholarship portal will close on December 15, 2023. Scholarship winners will be announced in January 2024.\nTo learn more about the GWLN scholarship, please visit \nCUWomen.org\n.\nGlobal Women\u2019s Leadership Network connects, inspires, , and empowers women with the opportunities and resources to make a measurable difference \u2026\u00a0 in the lives of each other, in the lives of credit union members and in their communities.\u00a0\nTo learn more about GWLN, visit \nCUWomen.org\n.\nThe Worldwide Foundation for Credit Unions is\u00a0the\n\u00a0\npartner organization\u00a0to the World Council, established to advance the shared vision of expanding financial inclusion through a vibrant and growing global credit union system.\n\u00a0\nJoin us on a global journey to transform a billion lives worldwide using credit unions.

As we wrap up 2023 we wanted to share some important updates with you.\u00a0Next month, we will host our final webinar of 2023 as well as our annual business meeting.\u00a0\nSAVE THE DATE(s)!\u00a0\nDecember 13th Wednesday Webinar @ 11:30am EST\n\u00a0\nResilience and Collective Care: Lessons from Black Communities presented by\u00a0\nDanice L. Brown, Ph.D,\n\u00a0\nProfessor of Counseling Psychology, Towson University\n\u00a0\n\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0\nExperiences of racial stress create daily and ongoing challenges for Black communities. As society continues to navigate the realities of systemic racism, Black communities have found ways to cultivate resilience through the use of collective care strategies. This webinar will\u00a0focus specifically on how Black communities utilize collective care in their resilience. We will discuss the use of culturally specific forms of protection, healing, and social support that have contributed\u00a0to\u00a0resilience among\u00a0Black\u00a0youth and adults. Additionally, the importance of allyship in creating a sense of belonging and support outside of\u00a0Black communities will be addressed.\n\u00a0 Registration opening soon!\nDecember 14th Annual Business Meeting @ 6:30pm CST\u00a0\nWe hope to see you all at our virtual annual business meeting next month. More information will be shared in the coming weeks including agenda, zoom link and more.\nAdministrative Officer Update\nThis summer our amazing Administrative Officer, Karen Fouts\u00a0has stepped down from her role. While she will no longer support SIETAR USA as the administrative officer, we are fortunate enough to have her still very much involved as she is leading the 2024 Virtual Conference planning. Please join us in thanking Karen for all she has done for SIETAR USA members. In August, we welcomed Christina Benavides into the role as our new Administrative Officer. You can still contact \ninfo@sietarusa.org \nfor any questions or support.\u00a0\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nIN MEMORIAM \nSIETAR USA honors the lives of Dr. BeEtta Stoney and Richard W. Brislin.\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nDr. BeEtta Stoney\u00a0\u00a0\nIt is with heavy hearts that we share the loss of our dear friend and colleague, Dr. BeEtta Stoney, best known as Be, who died on September 5, 2023 in Manhattan. \u00a0\nBe brought a unique and dynamic perspective to our SIETAR USA community, and we are a better organization today for her contributions. Be was a Coach and Associate Professor at Kansas State University for 24 years, and most recently served as their Interim Chief Diversity and Inclusion Officer.\u00a0\nBe proved to be an incredible team player, a skill she exemplified as a Hall of Fame basketball player at University of Texas, El Paso where she earned her bachelor\u2019s degree in secondary education - special education/health education and a master\u2019s degree in kinesiology. She also earned a doctorate in special education/multicultural education from the University of Texas, Austin. Be was inducted into the UTEP Athletics Hall of Fame in 2010 and ranks third all-time in UTEP career points with 1,249. \u00a0\nI remember Be most as an advocate for students and mentor. In 2015, I was fortunate to see Be co-present \"Mentoring Black Fraternities: The Modern Day Intellectual Talented Tenth\u201d, with five of her students from K-State at the Mentoring Institute at the University of New Mexico in Albuquerque, New Mexico. It was incredible to witness the love and admiration her students had for her and her mentorship.\u00a0\nShe was an incredible friend and mentor, and she will be missed by all of the lives she touched while she was with us. Our thoughts are with her family and those closest to her at this time.\u00a0\nTamara Thorpe\u00a0\nA Reflection from \nPatricia Malidor Coleman\u00a0\nOnce\u00a0upon a time two women met at a SIETAR USA conference. Two brown women from two different continents: two worlds apart, yet our differences are the reason why we connected deeply in a setting where building cultural differences builds relationships with trust and respect. \u00a0\u00a0\nBe Stoney was not sure if SIETAR USA was the organization was for her. She came and found a way to get involved at first in our silent auction to raise funds for students and those new to our industry to ease into the intercultural and global diversity field. This purpose resonated with her.\u00a0\u00a0\n\u00a0\nIt was through planning, setting and hosting this great event that Be and I exchanged on many of our commonalities: curiosity in cultures, creating a safe space to be authentic and have a true sense of belonging, leadership skills of women of color in sports, basketball, coaching, teaching. \u00a0We both agreed that she was at the right place not only to learn but also to give of herself.\u00a0\u00a0\nLater, Be worked on several committees and with our Board of Directors during my presidency at SIETAR USA. \u00a0\u00a0\nBe was a diamond in disguise that came out to shine as she so naturally does.\u00a0\u00a0\nI am honored that God put Be Stoney on the path of SIETAR USA as it is great women like her that brought new bricks to pave our road to stronger D.E.I.B. \u00a0A new and lacking perspective that opened the door for shifting perspectives, into the future.\nOne who has met Be Stoney will never be the same again as she touched many minds and hearts with tough and sincere love.\u00a0\u00a0\nR.I.P Sister!\u00a0\n \n \nRichard W. Brislin\n \nRichard W. Brislin died on August 24, 2023, at age 78. Another intercultural pioneer has left us. SIETAR USA members are reminded again that we stand on the shoulders of the giants in our field. We have lost a number of those giants with Richard being one of the most recent. A social psychologist, distinguished professor and researcher, he devoted his career to studying the effects of culture on behavior.\u00a0\nRichard was born May 9, 1945, and spent his early years in New England, high school in Anchorage, AK, college at the University of Washington, University of Guam, and Pennsylvania State University where he earned his Master's and Doctorate. Some might characterize him a Renaissance man because from an early age he approached and embraced a wide swath of life's enjoyment and accomplishments, including becoming an Eagle Scout, acting in high school and college plays, playing as a Bridge Life Master, becoming a self-taught folk and bluegrass multi-instrumentalist and ethnomusicologist in Americana music, and cruising the globe with Rose Ann, his wife of 52 years. In his early years he joined a circus and using an intercultural lens, perceived it to be a very close culture with its own norms, values, and social structure. \n\u00a0\nKnown for his early research in the intercultural field and his writing\u2014he published a wide array of books such as: \u00a0\nCross-Cultural Research Methods in Behavioral Science\n (1973); his earliest publication, written with Walt Lonner.\u00a0\nCross-Cultural Research: The Role of Culture in Understanding Human Behavior \n(1975) written with Marshall Segal. \u00a0\nIntercultural Interactions: A Practical Guide\n (1986); a personal favorite in which he used a Culture Assimilator approach to culture general issues, written with Kenneth Cushner, Craig Cherrie and Mahealani Yong.\u00a0\nThe Art of Getting Things Done: A Practical Guide to the Use of Power\n (1991); his book that could purportedly be found on \u201cnumerous congressional and corporate bookshelves\u201d and was selected Book of the Month in 1992.\u00a0\nUnderstanding Culture\u2019s Influence on Behavior\n (1993); his classic written as a text for courses dealing with culture\u2019s impact on human behavior.\u00a0\nWorking with Cultural Differences: Dealing Effectively with Diversity in the Workplace\n (2008); using a critical incidents approach to illustrate basic psychological processes that play a part in effective\u2014and ineffective\u2014intercultural and interracial relationships in the workplace.\u00a0\nThose books represent the tip of the iceberg in terms of Richard\u2019s multiple books and numerous articles. He valued his relationships with others and wrote and edited with a number of interculturalists such as Kenneth Cushner, Walt Lonner, Stephen Bochner, Harry Triandis, and Tomoko Yoshida.\u00a0\nHe was working in Washington, DC when SIETAR International moved from Pittsburgh and formed its association with Georgetown University. He became an early, active member presenting at the SIETAR conferences and attending various meetings and events. He felt that SIETAR was designed as a forum for professional educators, trainers, and researchers, and therefore should focus on the needs of the senior people working in the intercultural field. SIETAR has since struggled with balancing the needs of the senior professionals and addressing the needs of students and newcomers to the field.\u00a0\nLeaving the mainland for Hawaii, Richard led the East-West Center's Culture Learning Institute where he wrote many of his books on cross-cultural understanding. He had a second career in Hawaii with the Shidler College of Business at UH Manoa as a distinguished professor and chair of management and industry relations, where he was awarded the Regents Medal in Teaching and wrote further books on management and surviving in the workplace. He was the recipient of several professional awards and honors and was an invited speaker at universities and conferences across the globe.\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n \n \n \n \n \n \nUnsubscribe\n | Sent by SIETAR USA \n4880 Lower Roswell Rd, Suite 165 \u2022 Marietta , GA \u2022 30068",

When conducted properly, they are able to draw participants in, engage them and excite them for what comes next. Icebreakers also serve to provide reflection and a deeper introduction to the content of the workshops. As the holidays approach with the hustle and bustle of the season, let\u2019s convene for some fun and to learn best practices to conduct and debrief icebreakers, especially in a virtual setting. What works, what doesn\u2019t? Come and learn from experienced professionals and share your seasonal traditions and get energized for the holiday season.\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n \n \n \n \n \n \nNon-member registration \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nMember Registration \n \n \n \n \n \n \nUnsubscribe\n | Sent by SIETAR USA \nPO Box 548 \u2022 Wheaton, IL \u2022 60187",

Tragically, this will only increase in the coming months with recent wars and long-standing political instability in countries around the world. Critical emergency food relief will be needed as the first step to get communities on a path to food security defined in \nSustainable Development Goal 2 of Zero Hunger\n. \n\u00a0\nSeveral Global Washington members work in conflict regions on immediate humanitarian issues and longer-term programs to create sustainable systems for health and nutrition. Other members are addressing food security through programs that leverage local systems and indigenous knowledge. Please read more about these interventions and others below in this month\u2019s issue brief and featured articles. This month\u2019s Organization Spotlight on the S M Sehgal Foundation was written by our Communications Director, Joel Meyers, and features pictures and videos he took \u2013 we hope this also helps convey the incredible type of work our members do. \n\u00a0\nI also hope you can also join us at our \nAnnual Goalmakers Conference\n. Our virtual day will be on November 30 and our in-person day will be December 7 in Seattle. This is a wonderful opportunity to come together with peers to learn and re-charge for 2024. Our theme is \u201cAdvancing Transformative Philanthropy\u201d as we build on last year\u2019s conference about co-creation for better and more equitable programs in global development. More information can be found \nhere\n. \n\u00a0\nSincerely,\nKristen Dailey\nExecutive Director\n\u200a\nISSUE BRIEF\nOne Step at a Time: Targeted Community Engagements to Combat Food Insecurity\n\u00a0\nFor Mebrhit Hailay, a 28-year-old resident of Shire, Tigray, providing at least one meal a day for her three children had proved to be the exception, not the norm. A \nBBC investigation\n into the region\u2019s hunger crisis published in August 2023 shed light on the catastrophic effects of rampant starvation on Mebrhit and others like her \u2013 people affected directly by prolonged drought, civil conflict and the increasing scarcity of successful aid deliveries to the region. In its sixth consecutive year without adequate rains, Ethiopia sits at number two on the International Rescue Committee\u2019s \n2023 Emergency Watchlist\n; an estimated 28.6 million people in the country are in need of humanitarian aid, with 20 million of them suffering from food insecurity. The \n2022 Global Report on Food Crises (GRFC)\n categorized over 400,000 Ethiopians under Phase 5 of the \nIntegrated Food Security Phase Classification (IPC)\n, designated as \u201cCatastrophe/Famine\u201d \u2013 the most dire of the IPC\u2019s classifications for measuring food insecurity in a region, and the highest number of people to be placed under Phase 5 in the history of the GRFC. \nContinue \u203a\u203a\n \n\u200a\nORGANIZATION PROFILE\nS M Sehgal Foundation: Food Security, Women\u2019s Empowerment, and Rural Sustainability\n\u00a0\nI was blanketed by the humid, 92\u00b0 F day as I stepped out of the air-conditioned white SUV onto the rutted and sun-dried path. Shashank Devra, program lead for the Implementation Team at S M Sehgal Foundation (Sehgal Foundation), guided me toward his colleagues, who arrived in another SUV and a couple on motorbikes, and the local farmer we were scheduled to meet with for my visit. \nContinue \u203a\u203a\n \n\u200a\nGOALMAKER SPOTLIGHT\nGilbert Kamanga is helping women and Children THRIVE\n\u00a0\nGilbert Kamanga, National Director for World Vision Kenya, has a lot to be grateful for. Born in a small village in Malawi, Kamanga grew up in a family of six. As he puts it, poverty was not a stranger in his community.\n\u201cBut I thank God that through education, I was able to get some employment.\u201d\nWith faith as his motivator, Kamanga pushed himself to achieve more.

We\u2019ve got some product updates and tips for our sales, customer success, and marketing customers.\nMeet the Refreshed Calendly\nWe're always conducting customer research to help evolve our platform and make scheduling simple for individuals, teams, and enterprises. That\u2019s why we\u2019ve announced a \nrefreshed Calendly user interface that will roll out over the coming months\n.\nAs we gradually roll out this new experience, you\u2019ll eventually see a refreshed Calendly with a convenient sidebar for navigation and more intuitive event type and availability settings \u2014 that still have all the powerful scheduling capabilities you depend on.\nIn the words of our Head of Design, Jess Clark: \u201cMillions of people rely on Calendly to make important connections every day.

For example, as a salesperson, you can use \nCollective event types\n to bring a sales engineer to help close a customer deal. Or share meeting opportunities across customer-success managers with \nRound Robin event types\n.\nBut what if you\u2019re \u201c\nmulti-threading\n,\u201d and your customer champion now has 12 coworkers that need to \nvote on the best time to meet with you?\nLuckily, you can use \nMeeting Polls\n to make it easy for invitees to vote on their preferred time-slots, and easy for you to book everyone based on the most popular result. \nLearn How to Use Polls\nWebinar: How We Integrate With Microsoft\nYou can still access our popular webinar \nHow Calendly Integrates with Microsoft\n.

That was one of the top responses, and we were excited to share that Calendly\u2019s Dynamics 365 integration is coming soon!

ICU Day, as its commonly known, is recognized to reflect upon the credit union movement's history, promote its achievements, recognize hard work and share member experiences.\nThe ultimate goal is to raise awareness about the tremendous work that credit unions and other financial cooperatives are doing around the world and give members the opportunity to get more engaged.\nBut how did we get to the point of being able to celebrate the 75th anniversary? We take a look back at the origins of not just International Credit Union Day, but the entire credit union movement. We'll also hear what this annual celebration means to so many credit union professionals around the globe.

When conducted properly, they are able to draw participants in, engage them and excite them for what comes next. Icebreakers also serve to provide reflection and a deeper introduction to the content of the workshops. As the holidays approach with the hustle and bustle of the season, let\u2019s convene for some fun and to learn best practices to conduct and debrief icebreakers, especially in a virtual setting. What works, what doesn\u2019t? Come and learn from experienced professionals and share your seasonal traditions and get energized for the holiday season.\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n \n \n \n \n \n \nNon-member registration \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nMember Registration \n \n \n \n \n \n \nUnsubscribe\n | Sent by SIETAR USA \nPO Box 548 \u2022 Wheaton, IL \u2022 60187",

When conducted properly, they are able to draw participants in, engage them and excite them for what comes next. Icebreakers also serve to provide reflection and a deeper introduction to the content of the workshops. As the holidays approach with the hustle and bustle of the season, let\u2019s convene for some fun and to learn best practices to conduct and debrief icebreakers, especially in a virtual setting. What works, what doesn\u2019t?

ICU Day, as its commonly known, is recognized to reflect upon the credit union movement's history, promote its achievements, recognize hard work and share member experiences.\nThe ultimate goal is to raise awareness about the tremendous work that credit unions and other financial cooperatives are doing around the world and give members the opportunity to get more engaged.\nBut how did we get to the point of being able to celebrate the 75th anniversary? We take a look back at the origins of not just International Credit Union Day, but the entire credit union movement. We'll also hear what this annual celebration means to so many credit union professionals around the globe.

When conducted properly, they are able to draw participants in, engage them and excite them for what comes next. Icebreakers also serve to provide reflection and a deeper introduction to the content of the workshops. As the holidays approach with the hustle and bustle of the season, let\u2019s convene for some fun and to learn best practices to conduct and debrief icebreakers, especially in a virtual setting. What works, what doesn\u2019t? Come and learn from experienced professionals and share your seasonal traditions and get energized for the holiday season.\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n \n \n \n \n \n \nNon-member registration \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nMember Registration \n \n \n \n \n \n \nUnsubscribe\n | Sent by SIETAR USA \nPO Box 548 \u2022 Wheaton, IL \u2022 60187",

Icebreakers also serve to provide reflection and a deeper introduction to the content of the workshops. As the holidays approach with the hustle and bustle of the season, let\u2019s convene for some fun and to learn best practices to conduct and debrief icebreakers, especially in a virtual setting. What works, what doesn\u2019t?

Eligibility Code: \n\"SAVE29\"\nRegister Now\nDescription\n :-\nThis webinar includes two topics that are important for business leaders and employers to educate themselves on an unfortunate, yet very real trend in the country. Join us as we review Workplace Violence, specifically causes and signs to look for, pre-attack indicators, ways that you can help to de-escalate situations and keep your workplace safe, and how to prepare and handle difficult conversations. Next, we will review historical cases of active shooter incidents and understand the underlying details from investigators and law enforcement officials. Included is an examination of motivators and tactics used by active shooters. We will then review suggested reactions if you find yourself in an active shooter situation (Run, Hide, or Fight), including interacting effectively with law enforcement.\nAreas Covered:-\nPotential sources and signs of workplace violence situations\nPrevention and response to workplace violence\n\u201cThreat Assessment\u201d - how you can reduce the possibility of violent incidents\nHistorical overview and case studies of active shooter situations\nPersonal survival response \u2013 how to respond when an incident occurs\nLaw enforcement response\nWhy Should You Attend:-\nUnfortunately, active shooter incidents are not uncommon news items. Employees and former employees are stressed, upset, and frustrated and sometimes lash out in violent ways. Potential workplace violence clues are often overlooked or discounted by onlookers and co-workers for a variety of reasons. Tragically, turning away from these indications can result in dire consequences. Based on a thorough analysis by law enforcement experts, we know that there are specific steps that you can take to mitigate workplace violence situations. However, if you find yourself in an active shooter situation, do you know what to do and how to react?\u00a0\nOr more than 6 attendee call us at +\n1-833-568-8254\n or mail us at:- \ncs@ineducator.com\nYou can choose to stop receiving updates from us \nUnsubscribe Here\nEmail By:- Ineducators \n7201 Wisconsin Ave Suite 440 Bethesda, MD 20814",

We had content sessions covering how to improve outbound sales and inbound marketing to fill your pipeline, move deals forward, and increase retention and expansion. Plus, we hosted office hours with Calendly experts to demo the top ways to use Calendly. \nWatch Growth Week\nHubSpot Users:\nRouting Just Got Better\nMany of you are now using Calendly Routing on your websites to qualify, route, and schedule customers for meetings. We\u2019ve offered for a while the ability to do Salesforce CRM look-up (e.g., for account owners and more). But many of you have asked for similar look-up capabilities with HubSpot CRM.\nGood news: We\u2019re expanding our Calendly Routing solution to include HubSpot look-up capabilities. If you\u2019re interested in providing feedback, the \nprivate beta sign up is open\n! \nSign Up for the Private Beta\nWebinar: The Total Economic Impact of Calendly\nWe\u2019ve shared a lot of \ncustomer case studies\n with you. But I\u2019ve always wanted to have a third-party expert (read: not me) share their version of a customer story.\nSo, we partnered with \nForrester Research to do a Total Economic Impact\u2122 of Calendly\n study in which they talked to a few of our customers \u2014 including DocuSign, Atlassian, Semrush, and Gardaworld \u2014 about the impact of our scheduling-automation platform on their business.\nIf you\u2019re free, there\u2019s a \nlive webinar\n coming up about Forrester\u2019s views, which will include our customer DocuSign and me. And, if you can\u2019t attend, \nregister\n and we\u2019ll email you the recording.\nYou\u2019ll hear insights from the research including how a composite organization of interviewees with experience using Calendly realized a 318% ROI over three years. You\u2019ll also learn:\nHow DocuSign has benefited from using Calendly\nInsights from Forrester\u2019s in-depth interviews and data analysis\nKey areas where customers see success after implementing scheduling automation\nRegister for the Webinar\nCalendly AI Solutions\nWhen my friends ask me about how Calendly is going these days, the first question that comes up is \u201cWhat\u2019s Calendly\u2019s view on artificial intelligence?\u201d (The second question is \u201cDo you use AI to write those newsletters \u2014 seems like it?\u201d) \nWell, the answer to the first questions is here: \nIn a new blog post\n, Stephen Hsu, our Chief Product Officer, shares our views on AI \u2014 including how it will transform productivity and what this shift means for Calendly. \nCheck it out\n, and let me know what you think.\nAlso, if you don\u2019t want to miss out on any AI updates, we have a \nwaitlist you can join for early access\n to future AI-powered features, exclusive sneak peeks, and new content. \nJoin the AI Waitlist\nTip of the Day:\nSee When You\u2019re Both Available\nHow many times have you clicked on someone else\u2019s Calendly, and thought, \u201cI wish I could see \nmy\n Calendly availability next to \ntheirs\n.\u201d\nAs customer Matt Bolian says, it\u2019s called Mutual Availability\n: a feature that I think is pretty magical, which doesn\u2019t require AI, yet does leverage the millions of people who use Calendly to make it work.\nIf the other person has Calendly \u2014 and you\u2019re logged into yours \u2014 you\u2019ll see a \ngreen dot\n next to the times you\u2019re available too.\nLearn More\nIntegration of the Month:\nGong Engage\nI ran a poll\n on LinkedIn the other month to learn whether salespeople and entrepreneurs are doing more cold emailing and calling (or \u201ccold outbound\u201d). 82% said they\u2019re doing more!\nSales and marketing tools such as \nHubSpot\n, \nLinkedIn\n, \nActiveCampaign\n, \nMailchimp\n, and more make the brave act of contacting someone you don\u2019t know easier.\nRight now, I\u2019m really excited for \nCalendly for Gong Engage\n. Much like our \nGmail integration\n, it gives you one-click access to Calendly, directly from the Gong Engage email composer. Our team is all about one-click access because it lets us spend less time toggling between tabs and hunting for scheduling links, and more time on strategic tasks. If you use Gong, try out \nEngage with Calendly\n, and fill me in on your experience.\nLearn More\nAdditional Resources\nIncrease adoption and reduce churn with these customer success strategies and automations\nQualify, route, and book sales meetings instantly\nThanks for reading,\u00a0\nJeff Hardison\nHead of Product Marketing\u00a0@ Calendly\nNeed help?\n \u00a0\nHelp Center\n \u200c | \u200c \nPricing & FAQs\n \u200c | \u200c \nContact Us\n\u00a0\nMore than a scheduling link.\n \n \n \n \n \n115 E.

Mark your calendars!\n \n \n \n \n \nWhat makes diversity and inclusion\u2014seemingly so simple\u2014also so complicated and difficult to achieve? Truly bringing inclusion to life can sometimes feel quite challenging, especially when there seem to be forces pulling in many directions, and various inherent dilemmas involved in working with and across differences. What are some of the key challenges and tensions that often arise as we strive to create inclusive organizations and groups? How can we understand and balance the inherent tensions of inclusion\u2014for example, between comfort and discomfort, or between many identities (within us and within our groups) seemingly competing for expression and recognition? What does it mean to be truly authentic at work? Are there limits to inclusion? How can we best figure them out, together? In this session, we will explore three key paradoxes or challenges of inclusion\u2014those involving self-expression and identity, boundaries and norms, and safety and comfort\u2014and consider their implications for engaging and building collective capacity for DEI.\n\u00a0\nRegistration = FREE for current SIETAR USA members in good standing - use code\n\u00a0\nOCT4th_web\n\u00a0\n \n \n \n \n \n \nMember-Register \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nAbout Your Presenter\nBernardo M.

It will require cooperation on a global scale. Credit unions have a unique role as member-owned cooperative financial institutions; they prioritize community resilience and long-term sustainability. This is an opportunity for credit unions to innovate, serve member needs and expand their relevance.\nThis World Council of Credit Unions (WOCCU) virtual event will explore some of the challenges climate change presents to sovereign credit ratings around the world and the impact that has on credit unions. The webinar will also explore some of the challenges credit unions in Africa and Ukraine face, and how they are working on climate-resilient solutions in response to those challenges.\u00a0\nThis webinar will feature presentations from.\nKamiar Mohaddes\n, Professor of Economics and Policy, Cambridge University (UK)\nGrace Akinyi, \nHead of Programs and Business Development, African Confederation of Cooperative Savings and Credit Associations (ACCOSCA)\nAlisa Stetsyshyn, \nLead Communications Consultant, USAID/WOCCU Credit for Agriculture Producers (CAP) Project in Ukraine.\n\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\nContact:\n \nGreg Neumann\nWOCCU Director of Communications\u00a0\ngneumann@woccu.org\nWorld Council of Credit Unions\nP.O.

Achieving this goal advances other important goals, such as reducing poverty, improving quality education, and creating sustainable cities and communities. However, we are not on track with creating sustained economic growth in many countries around the world. We are at a moment of time to prepare for the future and train youth in jobs that will provide a decent wage and allow communities to thrive.\u00a0 \nGlobalWA members are addressing barriers to economic growth on various levels, including skill development, investments in entrepreneurs, and community support. Reaching full and productive employment for all is the primary aim of SDG 8 and our GlobalWA members are working with partners to achieve this goal. Read more about this work in this month\u2019s issue campaign.\u00a0\nTechnology is often essential in preparing for future jobs, both in the Global South and in the U.S. Our GlobalWA members are starting to use Artificial Intelligence (AI) to enhance their ability to deliver services. GlobalWA will have a members-only event in October about AI and one of our keynote speakers at our Goalmakers Annual Conference will address this issue. We will email members more information about the October event soon and registration for the annual conference is open to all. You can register for our Goalmakers conference \nhere\n.

This is an opportunity for credit unions to innovate, serve member needs and expand their relevance.\nThis World Council of Credit Unions (WOCCU) virtual event will explore some of the challenges climate change presents to sovereign credit ratings around the world and the impact that has on credit unions. The webinar will also explore some of the challenges credit unions in Africa and Ukraine face, and how they are working on climate-resilient solutions in response to those challenges.\u00a0\nThis webinar will feature presentations from.\nKamiar Mohaddes\n, Professor of Economics and Policy, Cambridge University (UK)\nGrace Akinyi, \nHead of Programs and Business Development, African Confederation of Cooperative Savings and Credit Associations (ACCOSCA)\nAlisa Stetsyshyn, \nLead Communications Consultant, USAID/WOCCU Credit for Agriculture Producers (CAP) Project in Ukraine.\n\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\nContact:\n \nGreg Neumann\nWOCCU Director of Communications\u00a0\ngneumann@woccu.org\nWorld Council of Credit Unions\nP.O.

Eligibility Code: \n\"SAVE29\"\nRegister Now\nDescription:-\nWorking with other people is never easy, but some employees make it particularly difficult. When an employee's negative attitude is not addressed properly, other team members become resentful, lose respect for their leadership, and they may develop their own negative attitudes. No one wants a difficult or toxic employee on their team, however, it's something everyone needs to be prepared to address should it arise. Challenging employees can try our patience and drain a lot of time and energy. Turning things around takes skilful management and patience.\n\u00a0Learning Objectives:-\nRecognize the signs of typical toxic behaviours and discover how to move those conversations forward\nIdentify and control the impact of toxic behaviours so that you can keep the situation from escalating further.\nLearn how to gain control and handle these situations by identifying the payoff.\nKnow how to act, not react, in resolving toxic situations so that you can lead with more confidence, feel less stress, and gain more success in working and interacting with your team. \u00a0\nAreas Covered:-\nToxic cultures decrease the ability to problem-solve, effectively communicate, and collaborate, and increase the risk of mental health\u00a0issues, absenteeism, and further difficult behaviours such as back-stabbing, finger-pointing, and gossiping.\nAn organization can be considered toxic if it is ineffective as well as destructive to its employees. \u00a0\nNegative attitudes and difficult behaviours are contagious and can create a toxic workplace culture. Toxic workplaces breed toxic employees and toxic employees breed a toxic workplace.\nLeaders who can appropriately manage any toxic and difficult behaviours will create an environment where they can effectively collaborate and thrive during challenges, and those organizations that simply try to ignore toxic behaviours will struggle to be productive, service their customers, and be competitive.\nWhy Should You Attend:-\nHow you and your team effectively deal with negative and difficult team members can mean the difference between having a toxic, drama-filled workplace, and an engaged, collaborative, and productive organization.\nUnder stress and surrounded by uncertainty, some members of our team become negative and resistant, and are simply more difficult to deal with. Reducing the drama within the team depends on being able to understand and respond appropriately to their behaviours.\nLearn successful strategies and tips for building a positive, productive workplace by knowing WHAT to focus on to move these interactions forward, HOW to effectively respond, and WAYS to manage the impact of their behaviour. Identify challenges associated with managing difficult employees, control your own feelings effectively, and create a positive work environment so that you can End frustration, and Act rather than react, to ensure a respectful, effective, and collaborative team.\nOr more than 6 attendee call us at \n+1-833-568-8254 \nor mail us at:- \ncs@ineducator.com\nYou can choose to stop receiving updates from us \nUnsubscribe Here\nEmail By:- Ineducators \n7201 Wisconsin Ave Suite 440 Bethesda, MD 20814",

    "body": "Read this in your browser.\nFOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE\n2023-09-19\nWFCU Philanthropy Welcomes New Leader\nMarcey Ciaccio starts with Members Helping Members campaign\n \nMarcey Ciaccio\nMADISON, Wis. \u2014\u00a0\nWorldwide Foundation for Credit Unions\n\u00a0(WFCU) is excited to present the new leader of their\u00a0\nfundraising work\n, Marcey Ciaccio. In June 2023, Ciaccio assumed\u00a0the role of Philanthropy Manager and dove right in to bolster WFCU\u2019s fundraising efforts.\nCiaccio took a circuitous route to credit unions, spending much of her career in healthcare before joining WFCU midway through 2023.\n\u201cI'm happy to say that I've always used a credit union. I've always been a member, but I really didn't have any idea what a difference credit unions make, not only in their own communities but across the globe,\u201d Ciaccio said. \u201cSo, my induction has been very eye-opening. It's vast. It's so impressive the work that's being done to help strengthen financial wellbeing around the world. I had no idea.\u201d\nMembers Helping Members: Having fun with philanthropy\nCiaccio had yet to meet the entire WFCU team when she was tasked with putting the much-touted people helping people philosophy to the test.\nIn honor of the\u00a0\n75\nth\n\u00a0annual International Credit Union Day\n, WFCU sought to raise $750,000 to support its work.\nMembers Helping Members\n\u00a0is a grass-roots fundraising campaign, challenging individuals and organizations to a little cooperative competition: to see who can raise the most money to support global good.\n\u201cThe idea was pretty straightforward,\u201d she said. \u201cWe wanted to excite and engage credit union employees and advocates and help everyone see their part in a global cooperative movement. That\u2019s what Members Helping Members is about.\u201d\nStrategic investment in three core areas\nWhile Members Helping Members is a discrete fundraising campaign, all money raised will go directly to WFCU\u2019s existing strategic initiatives of digitization, resiliency and environmental impact.\nCiaccio explains that while there are unique programs being delivered within each investment pillar, the three areas are strategically linked.\n\u201cImproving digitization is about access, fundamentally. It\u2019s about enabling credit unions in some of the most challenging situations to provide credit and solutions to new members. When they do, they\u2019re enhancing the resiliency of the organization\u2014they\u2019re building a more robust financial institution, capable of attracting, developing and retaining innovative talent. And we\u2019re supporting that talent\u2014particularly at the very top levels\u2014to identify ways their credit unions can develop more environmentally sustainable operations.\u201d\nThe Worldwide Foundation for Credit Unions is\u00a0the\n\u00a0\npartner organization\u00a0to the World Council, established to advance the shared vision of expanding financial inclusion through a vibrant and growing global credit union system.\n\u00a0\nJoin us on a global journey to transform a billion lives worldwide using credit unions. Visit\u00a0\nwww.doglobalgood.org\n\u00a0to start your journey today.\nWorld Council of Credit Unions is the global trade association and development\u00a0platform for credit unions. World Council promotes the sustainable development of credit unions and other financial cooperatives around the world to empower people through access to high quality and affordable financial services. World Council advocates on behalf of the global credit union system before international organizations and works with national governments to improve legislation and regulation. Its technical assistance programs introduce new tools and technologies to strengthen credit unions' financial performance and increase their outreach.\nWorld Council has implemented 300+ technical assistance programs in 90 countries. Worldwide, 87,914 credit unions in 118 countries serve 393 million people.

Mark your calendars!\n \n \n \n \n \nWhat makes diversity and inclusion\u2014seemingly so simple\u2014also so complicated and difficult to achieve? Truly bringing inclusion to life can sometimes feel quite challenging, especially when there seem to be forces pulling in many directions, and various inherent dilemmas involved in working with and across differences. What are some of the key challenges and tensions that often arise as we strive to create inclusive organizations and groups? How can we understand and balance the inherent tensions of inclusion\u2014for example, between comfort and discomfort, or between many identities (within us and within our groups) seemingly competing for expression and recognition? What does it mean to be truly authentic at work? Are there limits to inclusion? How can we best figure them out, together? In this session, we will explore three key paradoxes or challenges of inclusion\u2014those involving self-expression and identity, boundaries and norms, and safety and comfort\u2014and consider their implications for engaging and building collective capacity for DEI.\n\u00a0\nRegistration = FREE for current SIETAR USA members in good standing - use code\n\u00a0\nOCT4th_web\n\u00a0\n \n \n \n \n \n \nMember-Register \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nAbout Your Presenter\nBernardo M.

It involves recognizing and valuing the differences and unique perspectives of individuals from diverse backgrounds, and creating a culture of respect, openness, and understanding.\nBelonging\n\u00a0is the sense of being accepted, valued, and included within a community or group, regardless of one's cultural background or identity. It is the perception that one's unique experiences, perspectives, and contributions are recognized and appreciated, and that one has a place in the larger social fabric.\nBuilding a\u00a0\nCommunity\n\u00a0that embraces intercultural components and DEIB (Diversity, Equity, Inclusion, and Belonging) requires a deliberate and intentional effort to create a culture of respect, openness, and understanding. It must feature education and awareness, engagement in active listening and empathy, and create inclusive policies and practices.\nIt is more important than ever that we embrace each of these elements and make every possible effort to incorporate them into SIETAR USA and the world in general. By taking these steps, we can create a more inclusive and equitable world for ALL.\nClick the button shown below to submit your proposal\u00a0featuring\u00a0one or more of these topics \nno later than October 4, 2023\n:\u00a0\n\u00a0\nFor questions regarding the submittal process, please email: \nconferenceproposals@sietarusa.org\nWe look forward to receiving\u00a0your proposals!\nYour SIETAR USA 2024 Conference Team\n \n \n \n \n \n \nSubmit Your Proposal \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nUnsubscribe\n | Sent by SIETAR USA \nPO Box 548 \u2022 Wheaton, IL \u2022 60187",

We hope to see you there!\nDon't miss this Saturday Seminar!\u00a0\u00a0\nJay\u00a0Cafferata\n\u00a0will focus on how we unknowingly and unfortunately perpetuate racist ideology, colonialism, oppression, and discrimination in the words we use.\u00a0 We'll be discussing the breakdown in communication between intercultural and inclusion dialogues. When we think about intercultural, we think international, global or worldwide \u2013 but when we think about inclusion, we think local, internal and the workplace. Why are we having these different conversations to the same discourse? What is the breakdown between these two seemingly different sets of vocabulary?\nThis interactive 4-hour session will include videos, polling, and breakout sessions. Participants are encouraged to join using a device that has a camera and a microphone as well as a secondary device like a phone or computer that allows for multiple windows to be open at the same time for the polling.\nParticipants will discuss and reflect on:\nThe words we use to describe others\nHistorical perspectives on these two lexicons\nGlobal vs Local\nThe direction of impact: who is studying who?\nAt the conclusion of the presentation, participants will have:\nA greater recognition of how inclusion and intercultural fit together.\nThe basic awareness of how we present ourselves in an environment or culture that is not necessarily our own.\nStrategies to be more aware of where we are as professionals.\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nRegistration Fees\n$20 for Students\n$45 for current SIETAR USA members in good standing\n$65 for non-members\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nStudent-Register \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nMember-Register \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nNon-Member-Register \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nYour Seminar Leader\nJay Cafferata, MS, CDE\nMr. Cafferata is a well-known speaker and advocate for issues involving Diversity, Equity, Inclusion, and Belonging.

Now, your marketing and sales teams can improve qualifying and routing customers with these product updates that:\n- Integrate better with the signup form providers they already use such as Pardot (new!), Marketo, and HubSpot\n- Use Marketo to send emails to customers who visit a Calendly scheduling page but don\u2019t book a meeting (new!)\n- Use our Salesforce integration to match known leads with not only their assigned owner, but also filtering by deal stage, territory, or other fields in Salesforce (new!)\nAnd, if you don\u2019t have these third-party tools, you can always use our own Calendly Routing Forms\n to ask better qualifying questions that route customers to the right resource.\nCheck out this customer story from Calendly customer Smith.ai\n which is now booking 25% more from their website with Calendly Routing.\nExplore Calendly Routing\nIntegration of the Month: Close CRM\nFor our sales and marketing customers, \nCRM integrations with Calendly\n are critical to ensure your scheduling data can be leveraged by your customer-data \u201csource of truth.\u201d \nCRM provider \nClose\n partnered with Calendly to \nlay out a 7-step process to qualify sales leads \u2014 and close more deals\n.\nTry Calendly + Close\nLearn More About How People Schedule With You\nEver wonder how people like to schedule with you? Now, anyone on a Professional or above subscription plan \nview their personal scheduling Analytics\n.\nCheck out popular meeting times, top event types, and more to identify what\u2019s going well (and where to make adjustments) to:\nReduce cancellations by updating availability to when people like to meet\nGet some time back by identifying the sweet spot for meeting duration \nRepeat success by revising meeting formats to match most booked events\nUse Analytics\nHelp Your Teammates Help You\nDon\u2019t know about your team, but this time of year for us means teammates are on the move out of their offices. We\u2019ve long offered the \nCalendy mobile apps\n to make scheduling easier when on the go, but what about making life easier for your teammates?\nWith Calendly\u2019s new flexible Event Type permissions\n (Professional subscription plan and above), collaborators can cover for you when you\u2019re out of the office, manage handoffs during times of transition, and make updates for you.\nUse the gear icon in the Event Type builder to add editors, viewers, and co-hosts to your next meeting. Try it next time you\u2019re out of the office, and let us know how it works.\nLearn More\nMore Resources\nE-Book: Qualify, Route, and Book Sales Meetings Instantly\nLots of new Customer Stories!\nBuyer\u2019s Guide: Choosing a scheduling automation platform\nCalendly Etiquette: How to share your link politely\nThanks for reading.

When we think about intercultural, we think international, global or worldwide \u2013 but when we think about inclusion, we think local, internal and the workplace. Why are we having these different conversations to the same discourse? What is the breakdown between these two seemingly different sets of vocabulary?\nThis interactive 4-hour session will include videos, polling, and breakout sessions. Participants are encouraged to join using a device that has a camera and a microphone as well as a secondary device like a phone or computer that allows for multiple windows to be open at the same time for the polling.\nParticipants will discuss and reflect on:\nThe words we use to describe others\nHistorical perspectives on these two lexicons\nGlobal vs Local\nThe direction of impact: who is studying who?\nAt the conclusion of the presentation, participants will have:\nA greater recognition of how inclusion and intercultural fit together.\nThe basic awareness of how we present ourselves in an environment or culture that is not necessarily our own.\nStrategies to be more aware of where we are as professionals.\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nRegistration Fees\n$20 for Students\n$45 for current SIETAR USA members in good standing\n$65 for non-members\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nStudent-Register \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nMember-Register \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nNon-Member-Register \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nYour Seminar Leader\nJay Cafferata, MS, CDE\nMr. Cafferata is a well-known speaker and advocate for issues involving Diversity, Equity, Inclusion, and Belonging.

Pangea Giving is now a \nprogram\n of GlobalWA. Read our full Press Release \nhere\n. \n\u00a0\nThis is a very exciting moment for both organizations. As a program of GlobalWA, Pangea will be able to increase its member engagement, capacity, educational activities, partner relations, and programs in Seattle. For GlobalWA, having Pangea as part of its growing number of programs increases the ability for GlobalWA member organizations to co-create and partner with organizations based outside the U.S. for increased impact, and will create additional avenues of involvement for philanthropists. All with the ultimate vision to create a more equitable, healthy, and prosperous world. \n\u00a0\nOur Issue Campaign this month includes an interview with a Pangea Giving grantee, Executive Director Robert Kalulu of Child Empowerment Programme in Uganda; an interview with Pangea board members about the power and importance of site visits; and an article by one of the Pangea founders, Allan Paulson, about the founding and core principles that have guided Pangea since their formation in 2003.\n\u00a0\nMore information about Pangea membership can be found \nhere\n.\nAlso, a reminder that early bird rates for our 14th \nAnnual Goalmakers Conference\n will be in effect until September 13th.\u00a0 We hope to see you there!\n\u00a0\nSincerely,\nKristen Dailey\nExecutive Director\n\u200a\nORGANIZATION PROFILE\nPangea\u2019s Core Values and Principles\n\u00a0\nPangea Giving made its first grants in 2003 after a year of planning by a handful of people that grew to 13 members by the time we received and evaluated our first proposals.\u00a0 On this 20th anniversary, it is worth reflecting on the values and commitments that have brought us to this day as we become part of Global Washington.\nContinue \u203a\u203a\n\u200a\nORGANIZATION PROFILE\nA High-Impact Relationship\u201d: Robert Kalulu of CEP Uganda Speaks on his Experience with Pangea Giving\n\u00a0\nPangea Giving\n, the newest program of Global Washington born from a merger of the two organizations completed on August 1, 2023, is a Seattle-based philanthropic initiative founded in 2003 with the goal of providing financial support and guidance to growing humanitarian organizations in the Global South. Pangea Giving\u2019s unique model allows donating members to become directly involved in grantmaking decisions by joining regional committees, or \nPods\n, which oversee operations in Guatemala, Mexico, Kenya, Uganda, Myanmar, Laos and Cambodia. For 2023, Pangea Giving \nannounced grants\n totaling $114,000 to fifteen beneficiaries across Southeast Asia, Latin America, and East Africa. \nContinue \u203a\u203a\n\u200a\nORGANIZATION PROFILE\nPangea Giving Site Visits Build Trust\n\u00a0\nPangea\u2019s founding story\nA couple of months after the September 11, 2001, attacks, a group of people in Seattle started meeting to discuss how they could promote better understanding across cultures and countries. A giving circle is one of the ideas that came out of those meetings and some of the participants were drawn together to explore that option. This group of six like-minded people decided to work together to form a giving circle focused on rural community development in the Global South. They chose to create an all-volunteer-run organization rather than spending money on staff. \nContinue \u203a\u203a\n\u200a\nWELCOME NEW MEMBERS\n\u00a0\nGrow Further\nGrow Further\n engages farmers, scientists, and investors in participatory innovation for global food security and sustainable agriculture. \nGrowfurther.org\n\u00a0\nProvidence Global Programs\nSince 2012, the Providence Global and Domestic Engagement (GDE) department has partnered to make health impact through programs and service that honor the leadership, expertise, and goals of communities around the globe.

    "body": "EARLY BIRD RATE | CALL FOR TOPICS | FAST PITCH\nHello Grace,\n\u00a0\nThe theme of our 14th annual conference this year is \nAdvancing Transformative Philanthropy\n. This reflects recent trends in funding for global development to create more equity and stronger partnerships in philanthropy. We will examine the funder and recipient relationship, and test our theory that co-creation creates stronger, more effective partnerships and yields better outcomes.\nExamples to be discussed at the conference include U.S. based foundations that support community-based organizations in a low- or middle-income countries, U.S. NGOs that subcontract to other organizations, and giving circles that give to grassroots organizations outside the U.S.\nWe will unpack the inherent power dynamics between funder and recipient and then apply our co-creation process to determine better, more equitable relationships. This builds on last year\u2019s theme of co-creation \u2013 a timely and relevant issue applicable to all who work in global development. \nRegister by Sept. 13 to secure your EARLY BIRD RATE!\nREGISTER\u00a0\n \n\u200a\nCall for Topics\nAre you a GlobalWA member?

When we think about intercultural, we think international, global or worldwide \u2013 but when we think about inclusion, we think local, internal and the workplace. Why are we having these different conversations to the same discourse? What is the breakdown between these two seemingly different sets of vocabulary?\nThis interactive 4-hour session will include videos, polling, and breakout sessions. Participants are encouraged to join using a device that has a camera and a microphone as well as a secondary device like a phone or computer that allows for multiple windows to be open at the same time for the polling.\nParticipants will discuss and reflect on:\nThe words we use to describe others\nHistorical perspectives on these two lexicons\nGlobal vs Local\nThe direction of impact: who is studying who?\nAt the conclusion of the presentation, participants will have:\nA greater recognition of how inclusion and intercultural fit together.\nThe basic awareness of how we present ourselves in an environment or culture that is not necessarily our own.\nStrategies to be more aware of where we are as professionals.\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nRegistration Fees\n$20 for Students\n$45 for current SIETAR USA members in good standing\n$65 for non-members\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nStudent-Register \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nMember-Register \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nNon-Member-Register \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nYour Seminar Leader\nJay Cafferata, MS, CDE\nMr. Cafferata is a well-known speaker and advocate for issues involving Diversity, Equity, Inclusion, and Belonging.

Forum attendees were asked to evaluate the presentations and proposals\u00a0on their financial inclusivity, sustainability, creativity, planning and connection to GWLN, and ultimately vote to select two winners. This is a tremendous opportunity for these women to continue their efforts making impactful change in their communities, all through the support of GWLN.\u201d\nEnkhchimeg Nergui \ngave a presentation on her proposal to create a local business ecosystem in rural Mongolia that allows credit union members that are part of yak and sheep herder communities to diversify their income and promote eco-friendly and sustainable cashmere production.\nViolet Ndungu \npresented the ways her SACCO would use the grant dollars to promote the commercialization of dairy farmers through strengthening and capacity building, increased dairy production, promoting new feed production technologies, and improving access to savings and loans for women and youth on dairy farms.\nThe four scholars were originally supposed to give presentations on their proposals during the 2022 World Credit Union Conference in Glasgow, Scotland, but were unable to attend due to visa issues. \u00a0\nEach year, GWLN offers \nscholarships\n to encourage women leaders to attend the annual \nWorld Credit Union Conference\n.\nEmpowerment grants were first offered in 2014, and past projects included the creation of business development centers in financial cooperatives to help female entrepreneurs, the development of a series of financial fitness workshops for young females as they get ready for college, and the design and implementation of a communication strategy to reach financially-excluded youth and women.\nTo learn how you can support the GWLN empowerment grants, contact GWLN at \ncuwomen@woccu.org\n.

We\u2019re doing a lot more than sharing scheduling links. \nJoin our webinar series, \nHow Calendly Uses Calendly\n, for a behind-the-scenes look at how leaders across our very own sales, marketing, customer success and recruiting teams use Calendly to do their best work and create \nreal\n business results. Sign up to attend (and if you can\u2019t, we\u2019ll automatically email you the recording):\nHow Calendly Uses Calendly to Close More Deals\nFor Sales Teams\nTuesday, August 8 @ 10 am PT / 1pm ET\nRegister now \u2192\nHow Calendly Uses Calendly to Retain More Customers\nFor Customer Success Teams\nTuesday, August 15 @ 10 am PT / 1 pm ET\nRegister now \u2192\nAnd, if you missed our \nCEO Tope\u2019s session\n or \nmine with CMO Jessica\n, you can watch the recordings some time by signing up. \nSign Up for the Webinars\nTip of the Day: Reduce No-Shows\nAre people getting flakier these days, not attending events they said they would? One study by OnePoll revealed the \u201caverage person is a no-show to almost half of the events they are invited to.\u201d\nOne Calendly feature has reduced no-shows to my meetings 100%: \nEmail Invitees to Reconfirm workflow\n. I can\u2019t recommend the feature enough \u2013 particularly for salespeople booking calls with prospects.\nAvailable on the Professional Plan\n, I trigger this reconfirmation email to go out one hour before a meeting. The recipient has to \u201creconfirm\u201d the meeting with me. I then receive an email, advising they reconfirmed.\nSince implementing this workflow, zero people have canceled meetings at the last minute! \nGive it a try, and let me know if you see similar success.\nUse Workflows\nTraveling More?\nDon\u2019t know about you, but I\u2019m on the road a lot more in 2023. I can\u2019t always lug around my laptop, so \nCalendly\u2019s mobile app\n does the trick.\nYou can access your links, scan/reschedule upcoming events, or text a one-off meeting link\u2014all from the palm of your hand. A lot of friends in Sales use the mobile app when they\u2019re in the car between meetings. (Well, hopefully, they\u2019re not using it while driving\u2026) \nGet the iOS app\nGet the Android app\nGroup Admins Can Help Other Admins\nYour Calendly account admin has a lot on their plate. If that\u2019s you, we have a new \nProfessional subscription plan\n (and above) feature allowing you to \nshift some invite responsibility to group admins\n.\nAfter all, who better to invite users to a group than the people who oversee that group! Now group admins can own adding new hires to Calendly, enabling them to start scheduling meetings, fast.\nA group admin can also be an admin for multiple groups \nwithout\n being a member. This allows for an org member to maintain group standardization at a large scale, while leaving day-to-day maintenance to a team lead.\nLearn More\nMore Resources\nWebinar: Build a Better Journey for Retention\nWhy sales, marketing, and customer success teams should embrace scheduling automation\nBuyer\u2019s Guide: Choosing a scheduling automation platform\nCalendly for Enterprise overview\nThanks for reading,\u00a0\nJeff Hardison\nHead of Product Marketing\u00a0@ Calendly\n \n \n \n \nSent from Calendly\n115 E.

    "body": "Press Release\n\u00a0\nPangea Giving Joins Forces with Global Washington\n\u00a0\n(Seattle, WA - July 31, 2023) \nGlobal Washington\n (GlobalWA), a 501(c)(3) non-profit organization whose mission is to support the global development community in Washington State, announced today that \nPangea Giving\n, a Seattle-based giving circle operating since 2003, will become a program of GlobalWA starting August 1, 2023. The merger of the two organizations will create an unparalleled platform for global philanthropy and strategies to improve lives in low- and middle-income countries. \n\u00a0\nAs a program of GlobalWA, Pangea will be able to increase its member engagement, capacity, educational activities, partner relations, and programs in Seattle. For GlobalWA, having Pangea as part of its growing number of programs increases the ability for GlobalWA member organizations to co-create and partner with organizations based outside the U.S. for increased impact, and will create additional avenues of involvement for philanthropists. All with the ultimate vision to create a more equitable, healthy, and prosperous world.\n \n\u00a0\n\u201cThis is an exciting moment for both organizations,\u201d said Kristen Dailey, Executive Director of Global Washington. \u201cWe will have enhanced services, educational events, and opportunities for co-creation that will include more diverse perspectives and support localization for better outcomes. \u00a0Merging with Pangea also builds on our work with our Women of the World program that supports female philanthropists who care about global issues.\u201d\n\u00a0\nGlobalWA board member Jane Meseck is also looking forward to new opportunities, \u201cGlobalWA members will now have more ways to collaborate with Pangea grantees and learn from in-country examples for global philanthropy. It also aligns beautifully with our new \nstrategic plan,\n expanding our learning network to an impact network.\u201d\n\u00a0\n\u201cIt\u2019s a win-win agreement,\u201d said Janet Pearson, Board President of Pangea. \u201cWhen we formed Pangea in 2003 with the vision to promote more direct and positive international engagement, we could not have imagined a better outcome now 20 years later. By joining forces with GlobalWA we will be able to fulfill our mission even better and reach more individuals who want to join Pangea. And, this is really exciting and necessary, especially with the many challenges grassroots organizations and communities in the Global South face today.\u201d Pearson then adds, \u201cIt satisfies our need for expanding grant development, partner relations, and Pangea member support.\u201d\n \n\u00a0\nPangea\u2019s branding and name will be maintained as a program of GlobalWA. \u00a0A Pangea Advisory Council will be formed within GlobalWA to continue the vetting, recommendation, and evaluation of grants. The GlobalWA board will have ultimate fiduciary responsibility and final approval of grants, and one Pangea member would become a GlobalWA board member.\n\u00a0\nFor any questions about this announcement, please email Joel Meyers, Director of Communications at \ncomms@globalwa.org\n.

When we think about intercultural, we think international, global or worldwide \u2013 but when we think about inclusion, we think local, internal and the workplace. Why are we having these different conversations to the same discourse? What is the breakdown between these two seemingly different sets of vocabulary?\nThis interactive 4-hour session will include videos, polling, and breakout sessions. Participants are encouraged to join using a device that has a camera and a microphone as well as a secondary device like a phone or computer that allows for multiple windows to be open at the same time for the polling.\nParticipants will discuss and reflect on:\nThe words we use to describe others\nHistorical perspectives on these two lexicons\nGlobal vs Local\nThe direction of impact: who is studying who?\nAt the conclusion of the presentation, participants will have:\nA greater recognition of how inclusion and intercultural fit together.\nThe basic awareness of how we present ourselves in an environment or culture that is not necessarily our own.\nStrategies to be more aware of where we are as professionals.\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nRegistration Fees\n$20 for Students\n$45 for current SIETAR USA members in good standing\n$65 for non-members\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nStudent-Register \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nMember-Register \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nNon-Member-Register \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nYour Seminar Leader\nJay Cafferata, MS, CDE\nMr. Cafferata is a well-known speaker and advocate for issues involving Diversity, Equity, Inclusion, and Belonging.

    "body": "Read on web\n | \nUnsubscribe\n | Sent to: g.vottero@lcwmail.com\n\u00a0\nFOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE\n2023-07-23\nCredit Union Women Make Pitch for $10,000 Empowerment Grants\n2023 Athena Award also presented during GWLN events leading up to the World Credit Union Conference\n \nEnkhchimeg Nergui (speaking), with Polly Gathoni Waweru and Violet Ndungu\n \nWomen Leading panel discussion\n \nSandra McDowell\n \nMore than 350 people attended the GWLN Forum\n \nEleni Giakoumopoulus presents Ida Rosette Ocampo with the 2023 Athena Award\nVANCOUVER, British Columbia\u2014Four \nGlobal Women\u2019s Leadership Network\n (GWLN) scholars gave presentations aimed at securing $10,000 grants that would allow them to implement credit union projects empowering women during Sunday\u2019s GWLN Forum at the \n2023 World Credit Union Conference\n.\nThe four scholars originally submitted Empowerment Grant proposals as part of the 2022 GWLN Scholarship nomination process but were unable to attend the 2022 World Credit Union Conference in Glasgow, Scotland, due to visa issues related to COVID-19.\nThe 2022 GWLN Scholarship recipients who made their pitches were:\nDorothy Mambulasa\n, Malawi Union of Savings and Credit Co-operatives, Ltd., on increasing access to both finances and solar energy products at Fincoop SACCO.\nEnkhchimeg Nergui,\n Partnership Specialist, Mongolian National Confederation of Credit Unions, on creating a local business ecosystem that allows credit union members that are part of yak and sheep herder communities to diversify their income and promote eco-friendly and sustainable cashmere production.\nViolet Ndungu\n, CEO, Muki Sacco (Kenya), on promoting the commercialization of dairy farmers through strengthening and capacity building, increased dairy production, promoting new feed production technologies, and improving access to savings and loans for women and youth on dairy farms.\nPolly Gathoni\n \nWaweru\n, Unisa Sacco Society Limited (Kenya): on creating a training program to promote women credit union empowerment by growing female membership, competencies\u2019 building and leadership opportunities.\nEach scholar got 15 minutes to make their pitch, with three presenting in person and Mambulasa submitting a video presentation.\n\u201cAttendees were encouraged to vote based on the creativity of each proposal, and how it addressed financial inclusion, sustainability, planning and the connection to GWLN,\u201d said Eleni Giakoumopoulos, Director of Global Women\u2019s Leadership Network (GWLN).\nThe results will be announced after the 2023 World Credit Union Conference, with the top two vote getters each receiving $10,000 Empowerment Grants.\nA conversation with change makers\nGWLN Forum attendees were also treated to a panel discussion on \u201cWomen Leading: A Conversation with Change Makers\u201d, moderated by World Council of Credit Unions (WOCCU) Monitoring, Evaluation and Learning (MEL) Program Manager Dalia Mehiar, and featuring WOCCU President and CEO Elissa McCarter LaBorde.\nThe conversation centered around the theme of how to make credit unions and other workplaces in the industry more accessible to women who want to be leaders.\nMcCarter LaBorde said increasing access starts with organizations examining their hiring practices.\n\u201cI\u2019ve had to specifically work with recruiters or hiring managers and say, \u2018if you don\u2019t come with three candidates that represent a diverse pool, then you haven\u2019t worked hard enough,\u2019\u201d said McCarter LaBorde. \u201cSo, I see those things as related. Women who will step up to be a candidate and put themselves forward takes a lot of courage, just as it takes courage to be a hiring manager to bring on someone who isn\u2019t maybe the most qualified but is going to round out your workforce or C-Suite team (diversity).\u201d\nOther panelists included Elenita San Roque, CEO of the Association of Asian Confederation of Credit Unions, Scholastica Odhiambo, Board Director of Cooperative Bank of Kenya and Hazina SACCO, and Miriam De Dios Woodward, Global CEO of ViClarity.\n\u201cShut the Duck Up\u201d\nForum attendees were also encouraged to \u201cShut the Duck Up\u201d during a keynote address by Sandra McDowell, CEO and Founder of \neLeadership Academy\n.\nMcDowell relayed the message that many professionals who mentor or coach others do not spend enough time listening, because they are too anxious to insert their own thoughts or advice. She handed out small rubber ducks to drive that point home.\n\u201cThere\u2019s what\u2019s called the 80/20 rule which you\u2019ve heard of, of course\u2014it also applies to coaching. Who does the 80% apply to, the coachee or the coach? If you\u2019re having a true coaching conversation, you should only be speaking about 20% of the time,\u201d said McDowell. \u201cAnd if you find yourself talking, you can ask yourself \u2013 why am I talking? And you can look at your duck and remind yourself to shut the duck up.\u201d \u00a0\u00a0\nAthena Award goes to Ocampo\nIda Rosette Ocampo received the 2023 Athena Award during Saturday\u2019s GWLN Reception at WCUC 2023.\nServing as Chief Officer for Administration at Barangka Credit Cooperative in The Philippines, Ocampo began her GWLN journey at the 2017 World Credit Union Conference.\nShe has since established the Barangka Credit Cooperative Sister Society and worked through the cooperative and the Sister Society to foster professional development and network building to advance leadership training, facilitate financial-stability centric webinars for their members, and to secure a gender balance in governance by targeting the diversity on boards and within executive leadership to better mirror Barangka Cooperative\u2019s member base.\n\u201cI will continue my work to empower women in credit unions along with the mission of GWLN,\u201d said Ocampo. \u201cI am truly grateful for the opportunity to be part of this network and to work with so many talented and dedicated men and women leaders. I\u2019m excited to see what the future holds for the global credit union movement, and I am confident that, together, we can make a difference.\u201d\nThe Athena Award is inspired by the goddess of Greek mythology who stands for strength, courage, and wisdom and is presented to an individual or organization making an outstanding contribution to women's leadership in the international credit union movement.\n2023 GWLN Scholarship recipients\n were also recognized during Saturday\u2019s reception.\nTruStage\n was the lead sponsor of this weekend\u2019s GWLN events, along with co-sponsors: \nCo-op Solutions\n, \nOneAZ Credit Union\n, \nOrigence\n and \nPSCU\n.\nStill to come\nThe \n2023 World Credit Union Conference\n officially begins Sunday afternoon with the opening ceremony, followed by a welcome reception in the Solution Center.\nFollow conference activities and see daily event photos on \nFacebook\n, \nTwitter\n, \nLinkedIn\n and \nInstagram\n with #WCUC2023.\nPresented in collaboration with the \nCanadian Credit Union Association (CCUA)\n, the 2023 World Credit Union Conference runs through Wednesday, July 26.\nWorld Council of Credit Unions is the global trade association and development\u00a0platform for credit unions.

    "body": "July: Supporting Refugees - Reduced Inequalities (SDG 10) \u00a0\nTable of Contents\nIssue Brief\nOrganization Profile\nGoalmaker Spotlight\nJuly Links\nNew Members\nEvents\n\u00a0\nCareers\nDear Grace,\n\u00a0\nOver the past two years, there has been a dramatic increase in the number of people forcibly displaced around the world. 19 million people left their homes in 2022 due to conflict, violence, climate change, and other factors making their living situation unbearable. This brought the total number of refugees and displaced people to 108.4 million \u2013 a staggering number of people \u2013 and solutions for support and resettlement are becoming increasingly challenging.\n\u00a0\nHowever, I am hopeful that refugees are finding safe places and services due in part to Global Washington members. This includes emergency responses in places such as Ukraine and long-standing crises in regions such as Yemen and Myanmar, and ongoing programs for settlement and self-reliance. The expertise and resources that our GlobalWA members are bringing to bear is admirable and is certainly making a difference. Read more about these efforts below.\n\u00a0\nSeveral of the programs described below are done in partnership with one or more GlobalWA members. Collaboration and building trusting relationships are what GlobalWA is all about. Our network is growing stronger each year as we respond to member needs, make valued connections, and promote innovative approaches to global development. We are extremely excited about our new \nstrategic plan\n and centering the principles of co-creation throughout our work. We will have new member offerings and new member rates as of August 1st, 2023 to better reflect the growth and quality we aim to provide. You can read more about our new \nmember benefits here\n. If your organization is interested in becoming a new GlobalWA member, please contact us at \ninfo@globalwa.org\n. \n\u00a0\nSincerely,\nKristen Dailey\nExecutive Director\n\u200a\nISSUE BRIEF\nFrom Survival to Self-Reliance - GlobalWA Members Untangle the Complexities of the Refugee Crisis\n\u00a0\nReducing inequalities for all, the central pillar of Sustainable Development Goal 10, is a sentiment exemplified in no small part by efforts to address the rampant and growing refugee crisis. The lack of access to resources, whether they be vital for survival or instrumental in economic success, is a persistent issue present in refugee communities the world over. The number of people displaced around the world due to war, human rights abuses, and persecution reached up to 108.4 million as of 2022, according to the \nUNHCR\u2019s Global Trends Report\n. Increasingly strict refugee admission laws have exacerbated the disaster, highlighting a stark pushback against the acceptance of displaced persons. \nContinue \u203a\u203a\n\u200a\nORGANIZATION PROFILE\nOrganization Profile: Better Than a Movie: Operation Snow Leopard (Afghanistan)\n\u00a0\nImagine that your country is in turmoil and you may need to flee your home. You\u2019ll have to leave parts of your family, your livelihood, your community, and your belongings. Where can you go? When is the right time to leave? How will you get there? Maybe the fighting isn\u2019t too close yet, maybe your city won\u2019t fall. And then maybe it\u2019s too late to get to safety. Or maybe your partner or child is too sick. Who can help? For many people around the world, this is a very real scene from their lives. \nContinue \u203a\u203a\n\u200a\nGOALMAKER SPOTLIGHT\nElfatih Abdelnabi, Immigration Program Manager, International Rescue Committee\n\u00a0\nIt started with his own family.

I am reaching out to see if you are both available and interested in supporting a few deliveries of our Understanding Microaggressions training. The courses will be delivered in English, but our client (the Inter-American Development Bank) is eager for a facilitator that can receive and answer questions in Spanish. I also think it will make the training even more effective.\n\u00a0\nAre you interested?

When we think about intercultural, we think international, global or worldwide \u2013 but when we think about inclusion, we think local, internal and the workplace. Why are we having these different conversations to the same discourse? What is the breakdown between these two seemingly different sets of vocabulary?\nThis interactive 4-hour session will include videos, polling, and breakout sessions. Participants are encouraged to join using a device that has a camera and a microphone as well as a secondary device like a phone or computer that allows for multiple windows to be open at the same time for the polling.\nParticipants will discuss and reflect on:\nThe words we use to describe others\nHistorical perspectives on these two lexicons\nGlobal vs Local\nThe direction of impact: who is studying who?\nAt the conclusion of the presentation, participants will have:\nA greater recognition of how inclusion and intercultural fit together.\nThe basic awareness of how we present ourselves in an environment or culture that is not necessarily our own.\nStrategies to be more aware of where we are as professionals.\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nRegistration Fees\n$20 for Students\n$45 for current SIETAR USA members in good standing\n$65 for non-members\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nStudent-Register \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nMember-Register \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nNon-Member-Register \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nYour Seminar Leader\nJay Cafferata, MS, CDE\nMr. Cafferata is a well-known speaker and advocate for issues involving Diversity, Equity, Inclusion, and Belonging.

I was hoping to have an opportunity to work together again, and a new client need has come up. I am reaching out to see if you are both available and interested in supporting a few deliveries of our Understanding Microaggressions training. The courses will be delivered in English, but our client (the Inter-American Development Bank) is eager for a facilitator that can receive and answer questions in Spanish. I also think it will make the training even more effective.\n\u00a0\nAre you interested? And if you are, might you be available for an initial training on June 20 from 3-4:30 PM EST? \n\u00a0\nI\u2019d love to set up a quick time to chat through the project if you\u2019re interested and able (even if you can\u2019t make that specific time work) \u2013 let me know what you think!\n\u00a0\nThanks,\nGrace\n\u00a0\n------------------------------------------------------\nGrace Vottero\n(she/her/hers)\nConsultant,\n LCW\nEmail: \ng.vottero@lcwmail.com\n<image001.png>\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\n \nwww\n\u00a0\n|\n\u00a0\nTwitter\n \n|\n\u00a0\nFacebook\n\u00a0\n|\n\u00a0\nLinkedIn\n\u00a0\nTo inspire kindness, deepen\u00a0understanding, and\nfoster equity in\u00a0the communities\u00a0where people\nlive\u00a0and at the organizations where they\u00a0work.",

We will set up and share a link with you. This link can then be shared with the 48 individuals who will be accessing this eLearning. It will be a really straightforward process from a technical perspective \u2013 the only thing we need to emphasize is for individuals to use their same work email when they log in \u2013 the link will not allow more than 48 unique email addresses to access the training.\n\u00a0\nOutside of these logistics, my main question is around what you\u2019ve already considered or decided for how you will share and provide context for this training? Our clients often use an internal email to introduce and launch a new training, so whether it be an email or internal messaging system, I am here to support you with this communication however you need. \n\u00a0\nLooking forward to hearing your thoughts.

Upon completion, we are also asking that managers facilitate a team discussion about the impact of bias within their teams and what it means for the organization.\nThank you in advance for all that you do to embed inclusion into the fabric of our organization. \nCourse Link: \nINSERT LINK HERE\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\nBest,\nGrace\n\u00a0\nFrom:\n Arianna Talvy <\nat@covehillpartners.com\n> \nSent:\n Thursday, January 5, 2023 7:34 AM\nTo:\n Grace Vottero <\ng.vottero@lcwmail.com\n>; Alex Jannotta Dodyk <\nad@covehillpartners.com\n>\nCc:\n Vince Bongiovanni <\nv.bongiovanni@lcwmail.com\n>; Kelly Salek <\nk.salek@lcwmail.com\n>\nSubject:\n RE: LCW Consultant Introduction\n\u00a0\nThanks Grace!\u00a0 This is very helpful.\u00a0 We will plan to send an internal email to the team with instructions, so any example communications you have that you could share with us would be great. \n\u00a0\nOne other question \u2013 how will we track who has completed the training?

I hope it has been a calm start for each of you.\n\u00a0\nWe are all set for a January 16\nth\n start and are excited to get this launched!\n\u00a0\nIn terms of how it will work. We will set up and share a link with you. This link can then be shared with the 48 individuals who will be accessing this eLearning. It will be a really straightforward process from a technical perspective \u2013 the only thing we need to emphasize is for individuals to use their same work email when they log in \u2013 the link will not allow more than 48 unique email addresses to access the training.\n\u00a0\nOutside of these logistics, my main question is around what you\u2019ve already considered or decided for how you will share and provide context for this training? Our clients often use an internal email to introduce and launch a new training, so whether it be an email or internal messaging system, I am here to support you with this communication however you need. \n\u00a0\nLooking forward to hearing your thoughts. Please also know that I am always available for a call, if it is helpful, and you can book time with me whenever you need \nhere\n.\n\u00a0\nBest,\nGrace\n------------------------------------------------------\nGrace Vottero\n(she/her/hers)\nConsultant,\n LCW\n\u00a0\nTo inspire kindness, deepen\u00a0understanding, and\nfoster equity in\u00a0the communities\u00a0where people\nlive\u00a0and at the organizations where they\u00a0work.\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\nFrom:\n Alex Jannotta Dodyk <\nad@covehillpartners.com\n> \nSent:\n Friday, December 30, 2022 7:50 AM\nTo:\n David Katz <\ndk@covehillpartners.com\n>; Grace Vottero <\ng.vottero@lcwmail.com\n>; Arianna Talvy <\nat@covehillpartners.com\n>\nCc:\n Vince Bongiovanni <\nv.bongiovanni@lcwmail.com\n>; Hannah Strack <\nh.strack@lcwmail.com\n>; Melissa Neu <\nm.neu@lcwmail.com\n>\nSubject:\n RE: LCW Consultant Introduction\n\u00a0\nGrace \u2013 can you please provide an update here and make sure we are on track to hit the January 16\nth\n start date?

First, I estimated a launch date of January 16 for sharing the links. Second, I estimated that we will generate the registration report six months after launching. All of the timing is flexible and ultimately at your preference. \n\u00a0\nI also wanted to ask a quick technical question, so that I can get everything sorted on our side in advance. Do you all have a Learning Management System (LMS) that you intend to use to host the course?

Increasingly we participate in conversations about \u201cbelonging\u201d in multiple sectors and with several lenses. What does it mean to have a \u2018sense of belonging\u2019 when your entire life has been shaped by global mobility and different cultures? Third Culture Kids (TCKs) deal with issues of belonging because they have spent a significant part of their upbringing crossing cultures. Their experiences can make it challenging to find, form, and sustain a sense of belonging. In this webinar, Megan leads the discussion about what it means to belong in multiple communities: personal, professional, familial, cultural, and spiritual. Megan invites participants to ponder how to belong, where to belong, and why to belong.\n\u00a0\nRegistration = FREE for current SIETAR USA members in good standing\n\u00a0\nUse Members Only Webinar Code: MBR_WBNR\n \n \n \n \n \n \nMember-Register \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nAbout Your Presenter\nMegan Norton\nMegan Norton is an author, Third Culture Kid (TCK) consultant, intercultural trainer, podcast host of \nA Culture Story\n, and writer at \nadultthirdculturekid.com\n.

Increasingly we participate in conversations about \u201cbelonging\u201d in multiple sectors and with several lenses. What does it mean to have a \u2018sense of belonging\u2019 when your entire life has been shaped by global mobility and different cultures? Third Culture Kids (TCKs) deal with issues of belonging because they have spent a significant part of their upbringing crossing cultures. Their experiences can make it challenging to find, form, and sustain a sense of belonging. In this webinar, Megan leads the discussion about what it means to belong in multiple communities: personal, professional, familial, cultural, and spiritual. Megan invites participants to ponder how to belong, where to belong, and why to belong.\n\u00a0\nRegistration = FREE for current SIETAR USA members in good standing\n\u00a0\nUse Members Only Webinar Code: MBR_WBNR\n \n \n \n \n \n \nMember-Register \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nAbout Your Presenter\nMegan Norton\nMegan Norton is an author, Third Culture Kid (TCK) consultant, intercultural trainer, podcast host of \nA Culture Story\n, and writer at \nadultthirdculturekid.com\n.

This is the type of banking offered by credit unions, and represents a key opportunity for differentiation in financial services markets. The challenge is that measuring the social value of our work through the risk focused measurement approaches of standard ESG frameworks often understates our performance (or misses non- financial value creation entirely).\u00a0These limitations create an environment where an important opportunity for Credit Unions to leverage purpose and mission as a strategic differentiator is underutilized, but there is work underway to solve for this.\nDuring this session\u00a0Keith Taylor will share more about the DUCA Impact Lab\u2019s work with Simetrica Jacobs (UK) and Social Value Canada to address these challenges.\u00a0\nBy attending this session you will:\nExpand understanding of the social value outcomes of credit union products.\nLearn how the impact credit union's have on society can be valued.\nGain insight into practical opportunities to enhance the effectiveness of ESG programs.\nThis session is presented by:\u00a0\nKeith Taylor\nExecutive Director, DUCA Impact Lab\nDUCA Credit Union\nCanada\nWorld Council of Credit Unions\nP.O.

Increasingly we participate in conversations about \u201cbelonging\u201d in multiple sectors and with several lenses. What does it mean to have a \u2018sense of belonging\u2019 when your entire life has been shaped by global mobility and different cultures? Third Culture Kids (TCKs) deal with issues of belonging because they have spent a significant part of their upbringing crossing cultures. Their experiences can make it challenging to find, form, and sustain a sense of belonging. In this webinar, Megan leads the discussion about what it means to belong in multiple communities: personal, professional, familial, cultural, and spiritual. Megan invites participants to ponder how to belong, where to belong, and why to belong.\n\u00a0\nRegistration = FREE for current SIETAR USA members in good standing\n\u00a0\nUse Members Only Webinar Code: MBR_WBNR\n \n \n \n \n \n \nMember-Register \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nAbout Your Presenter\nMegan Norton\nMegan Norton is an author, Third Culture Kid (TCK) consultant, intercultural trainer, podcast host of \nA Culture Story\n, and writer at \nadultthirdculturekid.com\n.

    "body": "Read this in your browser.\nFOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE\n2023-06-21\nWorldwide Foundation for Credit Unions Launches Resilience Initiative in Ukraine\n$500,000 allocated for credit union loans targeting vulnerable populations and sustainable development\n \nWorldwide Foundation for Credit Unions\n\u00a0(WFCU) this week tapped its \nUkrainian Credit Union Displacement Fund\n for $500,000 to launch a new credit union lending program aimed at assisting vulnerable populations and boosting sustainable development in Ukraine.\nWorking in cooperation with the \nUSAID/WOCCU Credit for Agriculture Producers (CAP) Project\n, WFCU launched its Resilience Initiative after signing agreements with two United (Central) Credit Unions (UCUs) in Ukraine. The UCUs will pass the $500,000 on to individual credit unions, so they can provide loans aimed at stimulating rural and agricultural business recovery and growth and supporting vulnerable populations amid Russia\u2019s ongoing war against Ukraine. Resilience Initiative lending will target:\nBusinesses owned by women, or by those who were either internally displaced or left the country due to the war and have now returned to Ukraine.\nSustainable finance for micro-, small- and medium-sized businesses located in rural areas.\nThe structure of this program is similar to that of the \n$1 million USAID/WFCU Liquidity Fund\n that was set up in 2021 and has proven to be an efficient means of boosting agricultural lending through credit unions in rural Ukrainian communities. As of April 30, 2023, credit unions had disbursed 954 agricultural loans totaling $2.3 million from the Liquidity Fund under WFCU and CAP Project supervision. 621 of those loans, totaling $1.46 million, have been issued since Russia launched its full-scale invasion in February 2022.\nWith credit unions well-positioned to address the significant financial challenges facing Ukrainians, including those internally displaced or returning from abroad and those who stayed in their communities devastated by war, it is critical to provide incentive programs and additional funds to credit unions to share risks and build long-lasting relationships, especially with new businesses and members.\nSince the start of Russia\u2019s invasion, WFCU has implemented seven relief programs totaling over $645,000 that have focused on providing immediate assistance to the Ukrainian credit unions and their members. For more information, please see the \nWFCU Relief Results report\n.\nTo donate to the Ukrainian Credit Union Displacement Fund,\u00a0\nclick here\n.\nThe Worldwide Foundation is the fundraising and engagement arm of the World Council. Join us on a global journey to transform a billion lives worldwide using credit unions. Visit\u00a0\nwww.doglobalgood.org\n\u00a0to start your journey today.\nWorld Council of Credit Unions is the global trade associati\non and development\u00a0platform for credit unions. World Council promotes the sustainable development of credit unions and other financial cooperatives around the world to empower people through access to high quality and affordable financial services. World Council advocates on behalf of the global credit union system before international organizations and works with national governments to improve legislation and regulation. Its technical assistance programs introduce new tools and technologies to strengthen credit unions' financial performance and increase their outreach.\nWorld Council has implemented 300+ technical assistance programs in 90 countries. Worldwide, 87,914 credit unions in 118 countries serve 393 million people.

Eligibility Code: \n\"SAVE29\"\nRegister Now\nDescription:-\nMany have noticed that their work-life boundaries have blurred, and they have not taken a real break since the start of the pandemic.\nIt is essential that we find the strategies to manage our energy, focus on happiness, and integrate all aspects of our life. But how do we do that when we are time-pressured, reactive, tired out, and running on empty? Failing to focus on taking a break and creating balance and life satisfaction can lead to burnout, mental health challenges, and a variety of physical health repercussions.\nExamine your personal Wheel of Life and discover how you allocate your energy. By applying simplicity strategies to the S-O-S Principle, you will be able to discover a renewed sense of balance, engagement, and health.\nAreas Covered:-\nKey messages:\nBalance does not mean equal\nBalance is continually changing\nBalance and life satisfaction are activities that you continually engage in as you make corrections throughout the day, week, and months ahead. Focus is on more of what you love and less of what you loathe\nAs we move through challenge and out of crisis mode and transition into the next phase of adjustments, focusing on balance and life satisfaction is a critical part of staying mentally fit\nSimplicity: Small shifts can make major impacts on how engaged and satisfied you are with your life\nYou owe it to yourself to make sure you are maintaining a healthy work-life balance that allows you to thrive, both personally and professionally\nParticipants will:\nDiscover the results that a lack of balance has and the way that it is impacting their productivity, health, and enjoyment and that of their teams\nIdentify the many areas of priority and importance in life. Examine the Wheel of Life model to map strategies for how we allocate our energy\nFocus on Simplicity. Small shifts can make major impacts on how engaged and satisfied you are with your life\nUnderstand and identify the many energy drainers and utilize energy boosters to free up mental and physical energy\nGain clarity, a sense of direction, and motivation to live life with contentment, calmness, and connection\nWhy You Should Attend:-\nResearch shows that this is a normal response when a crisis occurs, but as the pandemic wears on, it is important to regain the focus on living a full and flourishing life despite the circumstances.\nBalance can feel like an unrealistic dream. Balance is an activity that you must continually engage in as you make corrections and adjustments based on circumstances. Balance becomes the harmonious simplification and integration of all aspects of life, including coping with business disruption, working remotely, and other impacts of the pandemic.\nExamine your personal Wheel of Life and discover how you allocate your energy. By applying simplicity strategies to the S-O-S Principle, you will be able to discover a renewed sense of balance, engagement, and health during this current challenge and as you move forward.\nOr more than 6 attendee call us at \n+1-877-896-6748\u00a0\nor mail us at\u00a0\ncs@ineducator.com\nYou can choose to stop receiving updates from us \nUnsubscribe Here\nEmail By:- Ineducators \n7201 Wisconsin Ave Suite 440 Bethesda, MD 20814",

It is true that we do often recommend the Understanding Microaggressions for Managers & Leaders \u2013 at a minimum \u2013 because we know they play a fundamental role in interrupting microaggressions and creating cultures and teams where microinequities can be called out, explored, and mitigated. Especially for larger organizations that are often logistically constrained in delivering training to all audiences, we want to ensure that the leaders and managers of the organization receive this training either before, or alongside with, the other employees and individual contributors.\n\u00a0\nAll that said, the Understanding Microaggressions training is perfect for an organization-wide delivery, as you are proposing with the two deliveries for your 51 team members. In my opinion, this training and the related conversations are truly enhanced when it is an organization-wide conversation.\n\u00a0\nThank you so much for sharing your DEI plan, I\u2019m looking forward to reading through and discussing further. In the interim, I am also sharing an updated version of the cost proposal, reflecting two deliveries of the training.\n\u00a0\nLet me know if you and Andres have time this Friday, or perhaps next Monday or Tuesday, to connect and talk through questions and next steps?\n\u00a0\nTalk to you soon!\n\u00a0\nBest,\n\u00a0\n------------------------------------------------------\nGrace Vottero\n(she/her/hers)\nConsultant,\n LCW\nEmail: \ng.vottero@lcwmail.com\n\u00a0\nWould you like to meet? \nClick here.\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\nwww\n\u00a0\n|\n\u00a0\nTwitter\n \n|\n\u00a0\nFacebook\n\u00a0\n|\n\u00a0\nLinkedIn\n\u00a0\nTo inspire kindness, deepen\u00a0understanding, and\nfoster equity in\u00a0the communities\u00a0where people\nlive\u00a0and at the organizations where they\u00a0work.\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\nFrom:\n Schwartz, Mark <\nMarkS@idbglobalfcu.org\n> \nSent:\n Wednesday, May 10, 2023 3:00 PM\nTo:\n Grace Vottero <\ng.vottero@lcwmail.com\n>; Sandoval, Andre <\nAndreS@idbglobalfcu.org\n>\nCc:\n Vince Bongiovanni <\nv.bongiovanni@lcwmail.com\n>; Melissa Neu <\nm.neu@lcwmail.com\n>\nSubject:\n RE: Follow Up - LCW <> IDB Global Federal Credit Union\n\u00a0\nHi Grace,\n\u00a0\nI want to thank you for meeting with Andre and me this past week to learn more about our Credit Union, what we are looking to provide to our staff, and for the additional information provided.d\n\u00a0\nIn reviewing the Overview Presentation, Understanding Microaggressions training is recommended for Leaders and Managers, whereas we had planned to provide this training for all 51 of our staff. We want to be all inclusive on the DEI learnings journey, however, I would appreciate your thoughts if you would suggest otherwise or have another recommendation.\u00a0 If we do provide this training to everyone, we would want to offer 2 sessions, as we will need to remain open to serve our members.\u00a0 If this would be an additional expense, we would also need to review a revised cost proposal.\n\u00a0\nI have included our DEI Plan as requested and welcome additional feedback.

I am attaching two documents \u2013 and updated and refined proposal overview with session details, and the draft Statement of Work. This includes the 30% discount being applied for anything \nsigned before June 30 \n\u2013 please let me know if you want me to also share a copy without the 30%.\n\u00a0\nIt\u2019s great to confirm the 12-month timing. I think that makes sense. I have included the initial timing by month in the project design, but it would be amazing to talk through and confirm exactly what you had in mind.\n\u00a0\nWhat you have described sounds great. I want to be sure that for the Leaders, we plan on completion of the IDI and their individual debriefs prior to Building a Culture of Inclusion, since our intention is for the first workshop to include the Group IDI debrief. If you think we should change this, we could talk about mixing it up a bit and doing a deliver of BCI without the IDI and before the test is even administered \u2013 but let\u2019s talk that through?!\n\u00a0\nRegarding in-person/virtual \u2013 right now, I\u2019ve only applied the on-site premium to the two deliveries of BCI that we\u2019ll do in-person. This means that everything else \u2013 so for leaders BCI Part 1 and BCI Part 2/ How to Disrupt Bias When Evaluating Talent \u2013 and for all audiences \u2013 the other two deliveries of BCI and 4 virtual deliveries of Managing Unconscious Bias in the Workplace (as a note, I recommend this course be deliver virtually). \n\u00a0\nPlease do not hesitate to reach out with questions, edits, etc.\nTalk to you soon, and I hope you have a lovely weekend!\n\u00a0\nThanks,\nGrace\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\nFrom:\n Tina Anderson (MMC) <\ntina.anderson@hellommc.com\n> \nSent:\n Friday, June 9, 2023 10:05 AM\nTo:\n Grace Vottero <\ng.vottero@lcwmail.com\n>\nSubject:\n MMC Follow-up: more info for you!\n\u00a0\nGreat chat, Grace, we are on a roll!\nI've just learned from Jen Schwerin (CHRO), that the suggested timing is a 12-month scope. We ask so much of associates and have so much going on, we can start with the BCI in fall (sept-dec timing) but that the 2\nnd\n\u00a0sessions (and IDI) will follow in 2024.\u00a0Does that make sense? I like the idea of a pulse versus getting it all done quickly, anyway, and the 2\nnd\n\u00a0session there will be time to pressure test \"what have you been doing differently since we last met? How are things now?\"\n\u00a0\nWe are still figuring out if we do the leadership sessions in person or remotely. Or, maybe a combo, jumping in when they are all in person for another meeting/event.... To me, it makes no difference in person or remote in this post-covid age.\n\u00a0\nThank you again for putting together the scope/budget/timing.\nTina\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\nThis email is intended only for the person or entity to which it is addressed and may contain information that is privileged, confidential or otherwise protected from disclosure.

I was out of pocket this AM but back to it. \n\ud83d\ude42\nYes, I assumed BCI is longer for execs but it was written as 2 hours in the proposal and perhaps in the SoW (not remembering exactly). Just to make sure all our i's are dotted before we share this with our President (Olga).\n\u00a0\nIn terms of dates - they haven't set a date for the retreat yet. It was actually an idea from Olga to do one this year (I didn't realize it was the first!) and they are looking for programming. So, it's perfect timing. I think we can cross December off our list - that month is too tight with vacations and holidays - will be hard to get people together.\u00a0\u00a0\n\u00a0\nGood news - I have the breakdown:\n\u00a0\nJunior Leadership Committee \u2013 35\nManagement Committee \u2013 74\nLeadership Committee \u2013 33\nExecutive Committee \u2013 11\n\u00a0\nMy recommendation is that you draw up TWO SoW - one where the Leadership Committee goes through IDIs and their own special session of BCI and one where they ONLY do BCI together without IDIs. I am wondering now if we rethink how we split. Do we combine the Junior and Mgmt Committees and offer 3 sessions that way OR do we offer management 2 and junior 1 (so basically have them meet by level?) I do think the top 44 are the ones who will want to go through the microlearnings later on.\u00a0 But I'd cascade for sure from Exec to Leadership to Management/Junior.\u00a0 Because I want messaging to trickle from each layer too, about how great the workshops were, how valuable, and we expect you to attend!!\n\u00a0\nI don't know that the last question (whether we offer 3 sessions and have Junior and Mgmt mix OR keep the leadership layers separate) is important today in terms of getting the scope and proposal updated. What do you think?\n\u00a0\nTina\nFrom:\n Grace Vottero <\ng.vottero@lcwmail.com\n>\nSent:\n Monday, June 12, 2023 6:04 PM\nTo:\n Tina Anderson (MMC) <\ntina.anderson@hellommc.com\n>\nSubject:\n RE: MMC Follow-up: more info for you!\n \n\u00a0\nHi Tina,\n\u00a0\nI hope you\u2019ve had a nice Monday! \n\u00a0\nRe timing for BCI \u2013 our version for Executives is longer because it includes the Group IDI debrief \u2013 however, we frequently adapt to 3 hours rather than 4.\n\u00a0\nIt would be amazing to deliver BCI in person for the ExecCom. For this session, we\u2019d want all of them to complete their 1:1 assessments and individual debrief sessions prior to the in-person event. For this session, 3 hours would be ideal \u2013 let me know if you think this can work.\n\u00a0\nFor the Leadership Committee, my recommendation would be tethered to whether or not they will do the IDI. If we want them to do the IDI, let\u2019s deliver a second version of BCI for Leaders to them. If we do not want to put them through the IDI at this time, it would make sense to do as you recommend and have them join the 4 \u201cAll Audience\u201d BCI sessions and have them join Exec Comm for the Disrupting Bias session. I hope this also answers your question about how to approach IDI for the 2\nnd\n layer. I am always going to advocate we do IDI when we can, because I think it contributes so deeply to a strong foundation for staff upon which they can build from future DEI conversations and learning opportunities. \n\u00a0\nI saw your note about numbers for Exec Comm, let me know when you know and we can update the proposal quickly.\n\u00a0\nBased on this information, I\u2019m just wondering if there\u2019s any other dates we might want to tether activities. For example, now we know that the first BCI delivery for Exec Comm could be in Fall, so we\u2019ll want the All audiences roll out to start shortly after. Are there any other specifics that you can predict at this point?\n\u00a0\nHappy to jump on a call tomorrow if it helps.\n\u00a0\nGrace\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\nFrom:\n Tina Anderson (MMC) <\ntina.anderson@hellommc.com\n> \nSent:\n Monday, June 12, 2023 10:11 AM\nTo:\n Grace Vottero <\ng.vottero@lcwmail.com\n>\nSubject:\n Re: MMC Follow-up: more info for you!\n\u00a0\nHi Grace!\nThis is great. In the proposal, on slides 16 & 17 - you indicate that BCI is 2 hours but my notes (and slide 14) shows them both as 4. Is this a misprint? Later, the overview slide for managers (slide 25), again lists it as 4 hours. The overview slide for all audiences correctly lists it as 2. I think 2 hours is perfect.\u00a0\n\u00a0\nI've learned that ExecComm (leaders of teams) is attending a retreat in fall (exact date TBD) so there is an opportunity here to\u00a0run BCI in person for them. I understand it is about 12 people. Exact # to come. I see you've priced out for 15 which is great for now.\u00a0\nWould you recommend then, that we split up the second tier just below (it's called \"leadership committee\") across the 4 \"All Audiences\", and then put them with Exec Comm for Disrupting Bias \nOR \nask this 2\nnd\n\u00a0layer to attend their own BCI for leaders?\u00a0\nHow does this impact the IDI work for that 2\nnd\n\u00a0layer?\u00a0On slide 18 you show 27 go through IDI assessments but how do we manage that if only the top ~12 are in person for that BCI session? Also, it shows administration to just these 15 on the SoW.\u00a0\nBased on this email, what updates (if any) do you need to make\u00a0to the deck/proposal? I'm happy to forward it on and our CHRO is meeting with Olga (President) today. CHRO and myself are both very excited about the plan - the 12-month pulse esp. and opportunity to run BCI in person for the top 12.\n\u00a0\nTina\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\u00a0\nFrom:\n Grace Vottero <\ng.vottero@lcwmail.com\n>\nSent:\n Friday, June 9, 2023 5:04 PM\nTo:\n Tina Anderson (MMC) <\ntina.anderson@hellommc.com\n>\nSubject:\n RE: MMC Follow-up: more info for you!\n \n\u00a0\nHi Tina,\n\u00a0\nWe really are! I am attaching two documents \u2013 and updated and refined proposal overview with session details, and the draft Statement of Work. This includes the 30% discount being applied for anything \nsigned before June 30 \n\u2013 please let me know if you want me to also share a copy without the 30%.\n\u00a0\nIt\u2019s great to confirm the 12-month timing. I think that makes sense. I have included the initial timing by month in the project design, but it would be amazing to talk through and confirm exactly what you had in mind.\n\u00a0\nWhat you have described sounds great. I want to be sure that for the Leaders, we plan on completion of the IDI and their individual debriefs prior to Building a Culture of Inclusion, since our intention is for the first workshop to include the Group IDI debrief. If you think we should change this, we could talk about mixing it up a bit and doing a deliver of BCI without the IDI and before the test is even administered \u2013 but let\u2019s talk that through?!\n\u00a0\nRegarding in-person/virtual \u2013 right now, I\u2019ve only applied the on-site premium to the two deliveries of BCI that we\u2019ll do in-person. This means that everything else \u2013 so for leaders BCI Part 1 and BCI Part 2/ How to Disrupt Bias When Evaluating Talent \u2013 and for all audiences \u2013 the other two deliveries of BCI and 4 virtual deliveries of Managing Unconscious Bias in the Workplace (as a note, I recommend this course be deliver virtually). \n\u00a0\nPlease do not hesitate to reach out with questions, edits, etc.\nTalk to you soon, and I hope you have a lovely weekend!\n\u00a0\nThanks,\nGrace\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\nFrom:\n Tina Anderson (MMC) <\ntina.anderson@hellommc.com\n> \nSent:\n Friday, June 9, 2023 10:05 AM\nTo:\n Grace Vottero <\ng.vottero@lcwmail.com\n>\nSubject:\n MMC Follow-up: more info for you!\n\u00a0\nGreat chat, Grace, we are on a roll!\nI've just learned from Jen Schwerin (CHRO), that the suggested timing is a 12-month scope. We ask so much of associates and have so much going on, we can start with the BCI in fall (sept-dec timing) but that the 2\nnd\n\u00a0sessions (and IDI) will follow in 2024.\u00a0Does that make sense? I like the idea of a pulse versus getting it all done quickly, anyway, and the 2\nnd\n\u00a0session there will be time to pressure test \"what have you been doing differently since we last met? How are things now?\"\n\u00a0\nWe are still figuring out if we do the leadership sessions in person or remotely. Or, maybe a combo, jumping in when they are all in person for another meeting/event.... To me, it makes no difference in person or remote in this post-covid age.\n\u00a0\nThank you again for putting together the scope/budget/timing.\nTina\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\nThis email is intended only for the person or entity to which it is addressed and may contain information that is privileged, confidential or otherwise protected from disclosure.

I was out of pocket this AM but back to it. \n\ud83d\ude42\nYes, I assumed BCI is longer for execs but it was written as 2 hours in the proposal and perhaps in the SoW (not remembering exactly). Just to make sure all our i's are dotted before we share this with our President (Olga).\nIn terms of dates - they haven't set a date for the retreat yet. It was actually an idea from Olga to do one this year (I didn't realize it was the first!) and they are looking for programming. So, it's perfect timing. I think we can cross December off our list - that month is too tight with vacations and holidays - will be hard to get people together.\u00a0\u00a0\nGood news - I have the breakdown:\nJunior Leadership Committee \u2013 35\nManagement Committee \u2013 74\nLeadership Committee \u2013 33\nExecutive Committee \u2013 11\nMy recommendation is that you draw up TWO SoW - one where the Leadership Committee goes through IDIs and their own special session of BCI and one where they ONLY do BCI together without IDIs. I am wondering now if we rethink how we split. Do we combine the Junior and Mgmt Committees and offer 3 sessions that way OR do we offer management 2 and junior 1 (so basically have them meet by level?) I do think the top 44 are the ones who will want to go through the microlearnings later on.\u00a0 But I'd cascade for sure from Exec to Leadership to Management/Junior.\u00a0 Because I want messaging to trickle from each layer too, about how great the workshops were, how valuable, and we expect you to attend!!\nI don't know that the last question (whether we offer 3 sessions and have Junior and Mgmt mix OR keep the leadership layers separate) is important today in terms of getting the scope and proposal updated. What do you think?\nTina\nFrom:\n Grace Vottero <g.vottero@lcwmail.com>\nSent:\n Monday, June 12, 2023 6:04 PM\nTo:\n Tina Anderson (MMC) <tina.anderson@hellommc.com>\nSubject:\n RE: MMC Follow-up: more info for you!\n \n\u00a0\nHi Tina,\n\u00a0\nI hope you\u2019ve had a nice Monday! \n\u00a0\nRe timing for BCI \u2013 our version for Executives is longer because it includes the Group IDI debrief \u2013 however, we frequently adapt to 3 hours rather than 4.\n\u00a0\nIt would be amazing to deliver BCI in person for the ExecCom.

I was out of pocket this AM but back to it. \n\ud83d\ude42\nYes, I assumed BCI is longer for execs but it was written as 2 hours in the proposal and perhaps in the SoW (not remembering exactly). Just to make sure all our i's are dotted before we share this with our President (Olga).\n\u00a0\nIn terms of dates - they haven't set a date for the retreat yet. It was actually an idea from Olga to do one this year (I didn't realize it was the first!) and they are looking for programming. So, it's perfect timing. I think we can cross December off our list - that month is too tight with vacations and holidays - will be hard to get people together.\u00a0\u00a0\n\u00a0\nGood news - I have the breakdown:\n\u00a0\nJunior Leadership Committee \u2013 35\nManagement Committee \u2013 74\nLeadership Committee \u2013 33\nExecutive Committee \u2013 11\n\u00a0\nMy recommendation is that you draw up TWO SoW - one where the Leadership Committee goes through IDIs and their own special session of BCI and one where they ONLY do BCI together without IDIs. I am wondering now if we rethink how we split. Do we combine the Junior and Mgmt Committees and offer 3 sessions that way OR do we offer management 2 and junior 1 (so basically have them meet by level?) I do think the top 44 are the ones who will want to go through the microlearnings later on.\u00a0 But I'd cascade for sure from Exec to Leadership to Management/Junior.\u00a0 Because I want messaging to trickle from each layer too, about how great the workshops were, how valuable, and we expect you to attend!!\n\u00a0\nI don't know that the last question (whether we offer 3 sessions and have Junior and Mgmt mix OR keep the leadership layers separate) is important today in terms of getting the scope and proposal updated. What do you think?\n\u00a0\nTina\nFrom:\n Grace Vottero <\ng.vottero@lcwmail.com\n>\nSent:\n Monday, June 12, 2023 6:04 PM\nTo:\n Tina Anderson (MMC) <\ntina.anderson@hellommc.com\n>\nSubject:\n RE: MMC Follow-up: more info for you!\n \n\u00a0\nHi Tina,\n\u00a0\nI hope you\u2019ve had a nice Monday! \n\u00a0\nRe timing for BCI \u2013 our version for Executives is longer because it includes the Group IDI debrief \u2013 however, we frequently adapt to 3 hours rather than 4.\n\u00a0\nIt would be amazing to deliver BCI in person for the ExecCom. For this session, we\u2019d want all of them to complete their 1:1 assessments and individual debrief sessions prior to the in-person event. For this session, 3 hours would be ideal \u2013 let me know if you think this can work.\n\u00a0\nFor the Leadership Committee, my recommendation would be tethered to whether or not they will do the IDI. If we want them to do the IDI, let\u2019s deliver a second version of BCI for Leaders to them. If we do not want to put them through the IDI at this time, it would make sense to do as you recommend and have them join the 4 \u201cAll Audience\u201d BCI sessions and have them join Exec Comm for the Disrupting Bias session. I hope this also answers your question about how to approach IDI for the 2\nnd\n layer. I am always going to advocate we do IDI when we can, because I think it contributes so deeply to a strong foundation for staff upon which they can build from future DEI conversations and learning opportunities. \n\u00a0\nI saw your note about numbers for Exec Comm, let me know when you know and we can update the proposal quickly.\n\u00a0\nBased on this information, I\u2019m just wondering if there\u2019s any other dates we might want to tether activities. For example, now we know that the first BCI delivery for Exec Comm could be in Fall, so we\u2019ll want the All audiences roll out to start shortly after. Are there any other specifics that you can predict at this point?\n\u00a0\nHappy to jump on a call tomorrow if it helps.\n\u00a0\nGrace\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\nFrom:\n Tina Anderson (MMC) <\ntina.anderson@hellommc.com\n> \nSent:\n Monday, June 12, 2023 10:11 AM\nTo:\n Grace Vottero <\ng.vottero@lcwmail.com\n>\nSubject:\n Re: MMC Follow-up: more info for you!\n\u00a0\nHi Grace!\nThis is great. In the proposal, on slides 16 & 17 - you indicate that BCI is 2 hours but my notes (and slide 14) shows them both as 4. Is this a misprint? Later, the overview slide for managers (slide 25), again lists it as 4 hours. The overview slide for all audiences correctly lists it as 2. I think 2 hours is perfect.\u00a0\n\u00a0\nI've learned that ExecComm (leaders of teams) is attending a retreat in fall (exact date TBD) so there is an opportunity here to\u00a0run BCI in person for them. I understand it is about 12 people. Exact # to come. I see you've priced out for 15 which is great for now.\u00a0\nWould you recommend then, that we split up the second tier just below (it's called \"leadership committee\") across the 4 \"All Audiences\", and then put them with Exec Comm for Disrupting Bias \nOR \nask this 2\nnd\n\u00a0layer to attend their own BCI for leaders?\u00a0\nHow does this impact the IDI work for that 2\nnd\n\u00a0layer?\u00a0On slide 18 you show 27 go through IDI assessments but how do we manage that if only the top ~12 are in person for that BCI session? Also, it shows administration to just these 15 on the SoW.\u00a0\nBased on this email, what updates (if any) do you need to make\u00a0to the deck/proposal? I'm happy to forward it on and our CHRO is meeting with Olga (President) today. CHRO and myself are both very excited about the plan - the 12-month pulse esp. and opportunity to run BCI in person for the top 12.\n\u00a0\nTina\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\u00a0\nFrom:\n Grace Vottero <\ng.vottero@lcwmail.com\n>\nSent:\n Friday, June 9, 2023 5:04 PM\nTo:\n Tina Anderson (MMC) <\ntina.anderson@hellommc.com\n>\nSubject:\n RE: MMC Follow-up: more info for you!\n \n\u00a0\nHi Tina,\n\u00a0\nWe really are! I am attaching two documents \u2013 and updated and refined proposal overview with session details, and the draft Statement of Work. This includes the 30% discount being applied for anything \nsigned before June 30 \n\u2013 please let me know if you want me to also share a copy without the 30%.\n\u00a0\nIt\u2019s great to confirm the 12-month timing. I think that makes sense. I have included the initial timing by month in the project design, but it would be amazing to talk through and confirm exactly what you had in mind.\n\u00a0\nWhat you have described sounds great.

I am also still confirming if Marina herself will be at the retreat. If not, the ExecComm number is actually just 10. I think we can assume it's just 10, actually. But fine to leave 11 in the scope for now.\nThank you!!\nTina\u00a0\nFrom:\n Tina Anderson (MMC) <tina.anderson@hellommc.com>\nSent:\n Tuesday, June 13, 2023 1:50 PM\nTo:\n Grace Vottero <g.vottero@lcwmail.com>\nSubject:\n Re: MMC Follow-up: more info for you!\n \n\u00a0\nHi Grace, Happy Tuesday! I was out of pocket this AM but back to it. \n\ud83d\ude42\nYes, I assumed BCI is longer for execs but it was written as 2 hours in the proposal and perhaps in the SoW (not remembering exactly). Just to make sure all our i's are dotted before we share this with our President (Olga).\nIn terms of dates - they haven't set a date for the retreat yet. It was actually an idea from Olga to do one this year (I didn't realize it was the first!) and they are looking for programming. So, it's perfect timing. I think we can cross December off our list - that month is too tight with vacations and holidays - will be hard to get people together.\u00a0\u00a0\nGood news - I have the breakdown:\nJunior Leadership Committee \u2013 35\nManagement Committee \u2013 74\nLeadership Committee \u2013 33\nExecutive Committee \u2013 11\nMy recommendation is that you draw up TWO SoW - one where the Leadership Committee goes through IDIs and their own special session of BCI and one where they ONLY do BCI together without IDIs. I am wondering now if we rethink how we split. Do we combine the Junior and Mgmt Committees and offer 3 sessions that way OR do we offer management 2 and junior 1 (so basically have them meet by level?) I do think the top 44 are the ones who will want to go through the microlearnings later on.\u00a0 But I'd cascade for sure from Exec to Leadership to Management/Junior.\u00a0 Because I want messaging to trickle from each layer too, about how great the workshops were, how valuable, and we expect you to attend!!\nI don't know that the last question (whether we offer 3 sessions and have Junior and Mgmt mix OR keep the leadership layers separate) is important today in terms of getting the scope and proposal updated. What do you think?\nTina\nFrom:\n Grace Vottero <g.vottero@lcwmail.com>\nSent:\n Monday, June 12, 2023 6:04 PM\nTo:\n Tina Anderson (MMC) <tina.anderson@hellommc.com>\nSubject:\n RE: MMC Follow-up: more info for you!\n \n\u00a0\nHi Tina,\n\u00a0\nI hope you\u2019ve had a nice Monday! \n\u00a0\nRe timing for BCI \u2013 our version for Executives is longer because it includes the Group IDI debrief \u2013 however, we frequently adapt to 3 hours rather than 4.\n\u00a0\nIt would be amazing to deliver BCI in person for the ExecCom. For this session, we\u2019d want all of them to complete their 1:1 assessments and individual debrief sessions prior to the in-person event. For this session, 3 hours would be ideal \u2013 let me know if you think this can work.\n\u00a0\nFor the Leadership Committee, my recommendation would be tethered to whether or not they will do the IDI. If we want them to do the IDI, let\u2019s deliver a second version of BCI for Leaders to them. If we do not want to put them through the IDI at this time, it would make sense to do as you recommend and have them join the 4 \u201cAll Audience\u201d BCI sessions and have them join Exec Comm for the Disrupting Bias session. I hope this also answers your question about how to approach IDI for the 2\nnd\n layer. I am always going to advocate we do IDI when we can, because I think it contributes so deeply to a strong foundation for staff upon which they can build from future DEI conversations and learning opportunities. \n\u00a0\nI saw your note about numbers for Exec Comm, let me know when you know and we can update the proposal quickly.\n\u00a0\nBased on this information, I\u2019m just wondering if there\u2019s any other dates we might want to tether activities. For example, now we know that the first BCI delivery for Exec Comm could be in Fall, so we\u2019ll want the All audiences roll out to start shortly after. Are there any other specifics that you can predict at this point?\n\u00a0\nHappy to jump on a call tomorrow if it helps.\n\u00a0\nGrace\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\nFrom:\n Tina Anderson (MMC) <tina.anderson@hellommc.com> \nSent:\n Monday, June 12, 2023 10:11 AM\nTo:\n Grace Vottero <g.vottero@lcwmail.com>\nSubject:\n Re: MMC Follow-up: more info for you!\n\u00a0\nHi Grace!\nThis is great. In the proposal, on slides 16 & 17 - you indicate that BCI is 2 hours but my notes (and slide 14) shows them both as 4. Is this a misprint? Later, the overview slide for managers (slide 25), again lists it as 4 hours. The overview slide for all audiences correctly lists it as 2. I think 2 hours is perfect.\u00a0\n\u00a0\nI've learned that ExecComm (leaders of teams) is attending a retreat in fall (exact date TBD) so there is an opportunity here to\u00a0run BCI in person for them. I understand it is about 12 people. Exact # to come. I see you've priced out for 15 which is great for now.\u00a0\nWould you recommend then, that we split up the second tier just below (it's called \"leadership committee\") across the 4 \"All Audiences\", and then put them with Exec Comm for Disrupting Bias \nOR \nask this 2\nnd\n\u00a0layer to attend their own BCI for leaders?\u00a0\nHow does this impact the IDI work for that 2\nnd\n\u00a0layer?\u00a0On slide 18 you show 27 go through IDI assessments but how do we manage that if only the top ~12 are in person for that BCI session? Also, it shows administration to just these 15 on the SoW.\u00a0\nBased on this email, what updates (if any) do you need to make\u00a0to the deck/proposal? I'm happy to forward it on and our CHRO is meeting with Olga (President) today. CHRO and myself are both very excited about the plan - the 12-month pulse esp. and opportunity to run BCI in person for the top 12.\n\u00a0\nTina\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\u00a0\nFrom:\n Grace Vottero <\ng.vottero@lcwmail.com\n>\nSent:\n Friday, June 9, 2023 5:04 PM\nTo:\n Tina Anderson (MMC) <\ntina.anderson@hellommc.com\n>\nSubject:\n RE: MMC Follow-up: more info for you!\n \n\u00a0\nHi Tina,\n\u00a0\nWe really are!

Our insights are in the Word doc here:\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\nWe do need to add in a question for Paul about what he means by Community Member. Does that mean people in MCF, Affiliate Company Leaders, Affiliate Company teammates, or just people who live in Minnesota from either a Rural/Urban area\u2026\n\u00a0\nPlease, let me know if you have any questions or concerns.\n\u00a0\nThank you,\n\u00a0\nCW\n\u00a0\nFrom:\n Hannah Strack <h.strack@lcwmail.com> \nSent:\n Tuesday, June 13, 2023 9:56 AM\nTo:\n Nassise Geleta <n.geleta@lcwmail.com>; Conner Williams <c.williams@lcwmail.com>; Daniel Gough <d.gough@lcwmail.com>; Grace Vottero <g.vottero@lcwmail.com>\nCc:\n Melissa Neu <m.neu@lcwmail.com>\nSubject:\n Minnesota Council on Foundations - RUBI RFP File Path, Assignments, & Questions\n\u00a0\nHello Everyone, \n\u00a0\nThanks for your help in working to get this new proposal out for the RUBI RFP out with such a short timeline!

Will MCF be drawing on their networks?\nAre there any conditions that would preclude LCW from future RFP\u2019s?\n\u00a0\nPlease let me know if I\u2019ve missed anything or if you hit any snags in the process and thanks again!\n\u00a0\nBest,\nHannah\n\u00a0\n------------------------------------------------------\nHannah Strack \u2013 she/her\nBusiness Development Associate \nEmail: \nh.strack@lcwmail.com\nPhone: +1 773-828-1202 [EST]\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\nwww\n\u00a0\n|\n\u00a0\nTwitter\n \n|\n\u00a0\nFacebook\n\u00a0\n|\n\u00a0\nLinkedIn\nTo inspire kindness, deepen\u00a0understanding, and foster equity in\u00a0the communities\u00a0where people live\u00a0and at the organizations where they\u00a0work.",
