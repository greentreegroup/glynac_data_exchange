    "body": "Hi Alisa,\nJust confirming, per our conversation on whatsapp, that the payment plan structure is indeed OK as we discussed and can therefore be entered into Quickbooks with the related accrued interest. Again, the payment amounts and start date are mostly irrelevant, given your cash situation and the bank\u2019s subordination (although that doesn\u2019t really apply to reconciliations \u2013 whether they like that fact or not)\u2026but the format for accruing is helpful to have documented.\n\u00a0\nIt might be best to enter them as a lump sum in Oct (for everything up through October) and then monthly for the correct amounts (so that we don\u2019t change any Q1-Q3 numbers on your balance sheet) so that they are true reflection of balances.\n\u00a0\nThen, we can use this spreadsheet to track payments when the time comes \u2013 including for the\u00a0 $5k from reconciliations currently being paid monthly to Monica and me for our assistance. (For those payments, btw, I think it makes the most sense to enter them directly as checks/payments without an \u201cinvoice\u201d or bill from us \u2013 to avoid confusion. They should be reducing the reconciliations balance due\u2026not paying an expense.)\n\u00a0\nSarah can make the entries for 2023, with your confirmation.\nThx,\nR\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\nFrom:\n Randall Stieghorst \nSent:\n Tuesday, August 22, 2023 10:44\nTo:\n Alisa Kolodizner <a.kolodizner@lcwmail.com>\nCc:\n Jennifer Barbieri <j.barbieri@lcwmail.com>; Antonio Jones <a.jones@lcwmail.com>; Monica Marcel <monica.marcel.2012@gmail.com>; Chuck Adams <c.adams@lcwmail.com>\nSubject:\n Updated payment plan\n\u00a0\nHey Alisa,\nIn light of the current cash situation (and the bank\u2019s subordination letter), I\u2019ve updated the payment plan to push any and all payments out to March 2024. Although I realize that the payment amounts themselves are probably unrealistic (because they are squished into the original timeline we had in the spreadsheet), it at least gives a running tally of where things are.\u00a0 I\u2019ve also tweaked the spreadsheet to include more rows (for clarity), showing EOM balances, interest payment amounts, etc.). If you compare the May and Aug tabs, you\u2019ll see what I mean.\n\u00a0\nAlthough the only changes are to the timing of possible payments, please confirm that we are in agreement on the structure of the payment plan. And once confirmed, it would be a good idea to ensure that the balance sheet shows the correct amount due for the notes \u2013 especially for the reconciliation amount (which is just the A/R from the original sales agreement \u2013 but now with accruing interest).\n\u00a0\nIf there are any questions or you want to chat through things, let me know \u2013 otherwise, just a confirmation that this is correct and reflects our mutual understanding is sufficient.\n\u00a0\nThx,\nR\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\nRandall Stieghorst\nLCW\nWebsite\n\u00a0\n|\n\u00a0\nTwitter\n \n|\n\u00a0\nFacebook\n\u00a0\n|\n\u00a0\nLinkedIn",
