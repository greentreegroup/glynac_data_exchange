This report doesn\u2019t produce an accurate amount for what will be invoiced in a month. \u00a0For example, for line for 72 was already billed and that SOW only has 18k left to schedule and bill. The 72k is appearing because the date on the line is set for august. The Invoice listed to First Bank for 22K was also already billed. We should only include SOW signed for this report, because SOW(TBD) AND SOW sig pending appear in the Pipeline report(See Richemont). We\u2019ve essentially been duplicating the cash flow for some SOWs. It\u2019s important for us to keep the status of the SOW\u2019s up to date because it impacts how we forecast cash. \n\u00a0\nSuggested Quick Fix\n\u00a0\nProjected Invoices \u2013 I\u2019ll update this amount manually to see what we\u2019re going to bill for in the next 3 months.\nPipeline report \u2013 verify that amounts on report are not included in projected invoices report. 1 mil of the 1.3 mil sitting in the pipeline is categorized as SOW pending with no dates and extend through 2024. Some SOWs span multiple year. Can I reach out to each consultant to help get an understanding of when we will get this work?\n\u00a0\nLong term Fix\nThe best way to see what we have left to bill is the WIP report. For that to work we must make sure all the consultants create projects and link them with their associated SOWs. The date on projects must extend past the current date and the budgeted amount must match the amount of the signed SOW. This way the WIP report will show all the open projects/SOW and what is left to schedule and bill on them. For example, the remaining amount to bill on a Johnson and Johnson SOW is 200K but it wasn\u2019t appearing on my WIP or the reports above until I updated the budget amount and extended the due date past today. I can thumb through the open SOWs not linked to projects and have the consultants update them.\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\nAntonio Jones\nHe/Him\nController\nLCW\nWebsite\n\u00a0\n|\n\u00a0\nTwitter\n \n|\n\u00a0\nFacebook\n\u00a0\n|\n\u00a0\nLinkedIn\nView our upcoming events\n | \nSign-up for our newsletter",

This report doesn\u2019t produce an accurate amount for what will be invoiced in a month. \u00a0For example, for line for 72 was already billed and that SOW only has 18k left to schedule and bill. The 72k is appearing because the date on the line is set for august. The Invoice listed to First Bank for 22K was also already billed. We should only include SOW signed for this report, because SOW(TBD) AND SOW sig pending appear in the Pipeline report(See Richemont). We\u2019ve essentially been duplicating the cash flow for some SOWs. It\u2019s important for us to keep the status of the SOW\u2019s up to date because it impacts how we forecast cash. \n\u00a0\nSuggested Quick Fix\n\u00a0\nProjected Invoices \u2013 I\u2019ll update this amount manually to see what we\u2019re going to bill for in the next 3 months.\nPipeline report \u2013 verify that amounts on report are not included in projected invoices report. 1 mil of the 1.3 mil sitting in the pipeline is categorized as SOW pending with no dates and extend through 2024. Some SOWs span multiple year. Can I reach out to each consultant to help get an understanding of when we will get this work?\n\u00a0\nLong term Fix\nThe best way to see what we have left to bill is the WIP report. For that to work we must make sure all the consultants create projects and link them with their associated SOWs. The date on projects must extend past the current date and the budgeted amount must match the amount of the signed SOW. This way the WIP report will show all the open projects/SOW and what is left to schedule and bill on them. For example, the remaining amount to bill on a Johnson and Johnson SOW is 200K but it wasn\u2019t appearing on my WIP or the reports above until I updated the budget amount and extended the due date past today. I can thumb through the open SOWs not linked to projects and have the consultants update them.\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\nAntonio Jones\nHe/Him\nController\nLCW\nWebsite\n\u00a0\n|\n\u00a0\nTwitter\n \n|\n\u00a0\nFacebook\n\u00a0\n|\n\u00a0\nLinkedIn\nView our upcoming events\n | \nSign-up for our newsletter",
