This includes defining the goals of the mentorship, how often you\u2019ll meet, and what you hope to accomplish. Clear communication sets the foundation for a strong, productive relationship that benefits everyone.\nMentoring Programs\nWhen establishing a mentoring program, start by \ncreating a clear definition of mentoring \nand its key elements: its purpose, who it is for, the skills required, and its ultimate goals. A well-defined framework ensures alignment, sets clear expectations, and maximizes the program\u2019s impact for both mentors and mentees.\nREADY TO MAKE A DIFFERENCE?
