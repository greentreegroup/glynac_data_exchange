This includes defining the goals of the mentorship, how often you\u2019ll meet, and what you hope to accomplish. Clear communication sets the foundation for a strong, productive relationship that benefits everyone.\nMentoring Programs\nWhen establishing a mentoring program, start by \ncreating a clear definition of mentoring \nand its key elements: its purpose, who it is for, the skills required, and its ultimate goals. A well-defined framework ensures alignment, sets clear expectations, and maximizes the program\u2019s impact for both mentors and mentees.\nREADY TO MAKE A DIFFERENCE?

In part, because I have had so many incredible mentors that have helped me make difficult decisions throughout my career. Too often, folks feel like they have to go it alone, but they don't.\nMentors make a difference.\nHere are just 5 of the benefits to joining the Real Mentors Network:\nMentorship opens doors to fulfilled learning and growth as well as advanced opportunities.\u00a0\nProfessionals with mentors are more likely to be promoted than those who don\u2019t.\u00a0\nMentorship is not only a key factor in retaining talent from under- or unrepresented communities, but a powerful way to address systemic inequities that keep BIPOC talent stuck, unfulfilled, and disengaged.\u00a0\nStudies have shown that mentoring is a more impactful diversity and inclusion strategy than standard corporate training.\nReal Mentors bridge the gap with impactful and inclusive mentorship driven from authentic connections.\n\u00a0\nThere is NO IMMEDIATE TIME COMMITMENT and YOU control your availability.\nBecome a Mentor\n \n \nGot questions?

I have been channeling all of my time into a new business initiative, \nReal Mentors Network\n.\nOn October 27\nth\n, National Mentoring Day, I will be launching the \nReal Mentors Network\n, an online mentoring platform that uses an insight-driven algorithm for matching professionals in order to promote leadership and growth.\nConceptualized in 2012, I took the audacious step in 2020 to bring this vision to life. Now, just 3 years later, my vision for a place and space for professionals to have greater and more equitable access to mentors is a reality.\nAnd I want you to be one of the many incredible professionals to become a mentor in the Real Mentors Network. \nComplete your profile here\n!\nThe only requirement is a calendar scheduling link (Calendly, Google, Acuity, etc) and desire to share your experience and expertise. \nWe\u2019d love to have your profile up by Friday!\nIf you have any questions or problems building profile, send an SOS to info@realmentors.net.\nMore questions?\nWhat if I don\u2019t have a Calendly account?\nCalendly is free and easy, and gives you the most control over your availability for mentoring. With Calendly, \nYOU\n decide what days/times you are available to mentor, and a Calendly link makes it easy for a Mentee to schedule time with you when they\u2019re ready. No more going back and forth via email trying to find the best spot. \nHere are some video tutorials\nWhat if I don\u2019t have a lot of time?\nYou're in the driver's seat; you determine how much time you can commit, even if it is an hour per month, your mentoring can have a huge impact. By setting up a Calendly account, you can be as narrow or expansive as you need to be with your availability.\n\u00a0\nThis is a beta launch so while we get this going, we are not anticipating a large number of mentees in year one, but enough to test the system and marketplace. In fact, we don\u2019t anticipate much activity for the first couple of months. But, again, you decide how much time you have to help.\n\u00a0\nHow many people am I expected to mentor?\n\u00a0\nRight now, we are front loading Mentors into the system, so that Mentees have more choices, more access to our great Mentors.\n\u00a0\nThe network is launching October 27, 2023. As this gets rolling, you may or may not have anyone reach out right away.\u00a0\n\u00a0\nAm I ready to be a mentor?\n\u00a0\nIf you haven\u2019t knowingly mentored before, this could be an intimidating invitation. But you have received this invitation because in some way or another you have been a mentor to me or I\u2019ve seen you mentor others.\n\u00a0\nThe platform algorithm is designed to match you other adult professionals who are in need of what you have to offer and align with your availability.\n\u00a0Thank you for joining the Real Mentors Network, your support for me and future mentees is so greatly appreciated.\nTamara\n\u00a0 \n \nWhat's the difference between a mentor and coach?\nNot sure about being a mentor? Join me for a conversation with Ben Cross, founder of LOVE + RELO and leader in the global mobility industry. We had a great \"learning\" conversation, discussing the power of mentoring and how mentors are different from coaches. I also shared tips for the delicate process of ending a mentoring relationship. \nLISTEN NOW\n!\n \nGot questions?
