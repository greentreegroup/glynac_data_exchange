Now that this policy has been in this mode for 90 days, it\u2019ll be automatically turned to \nOn\n during the week of June 10, 2024. \nOnce the policy is on, all users covered by it will need to have multifactor authentication. \nThe\n per-user multifactor authentication users \npolicy doesn\u2019t affect users\u2019 experience as they\u2019re already using multifactor authentication\n. \nThis policy helps you migrate to Microsoft Entra Conditional Access, which offers a number of \nimprovements\n, including a better admin experience and more granular access control. \nRequired action \nTo avoid any potential disruption to users\u2019 access and to ensure that this policy meets your organization's needs, \ntake the following actions before June 10, 2024: \nReview the \neffects and benefits\n of this policy. If you don\u2019t want us to turn it on automatically, set it to \nOff\n. Or, you may set it to \nOn\n at any time.\nCustomize this policy according to your specific needs, such as \nexcluding emergency access accounts\n. To make more extensive customizations, you can duplicate Microsoft-managed policies and make any changes you need.\u202f \nVerify that all users covered by this policy have enabled and registered at least one multifactor authentication method. If necessary, \nrun a registration campaign\n to set up the Authenticator app. \nHelp and support \nLearn more about \nMicrosoft-managed Conditional Access policies\n.
