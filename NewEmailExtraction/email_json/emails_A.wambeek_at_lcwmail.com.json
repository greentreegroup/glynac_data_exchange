Good to hear that things are moving and evolving in Ubisoft.\u00a0\nFrankly, I do agree with the feedback and the criticism about the Leader programme that Raashi has voiced. The programme was, in a way, developed with a lot of people involved, with many compromises, trying to achieve probably too many things. And yes, it was very unfortunate that neither Annelie nor myself had had a chance to see the e-learning before it was sent to participants. It\u2019s a difficult position to be in, as you can appreciate, to on the one hand run a programme that was not developed by us (meaning Annelie and myself), respond to participants in a dynamic way, and inevitably frustrate the need for easy solutions where there are none. But that all comes with the job :-)\u00a0\nI\u2019m looking forward to hearing what\u2019s on the horizon when things become more concrete. As you know, in 2023 I\u2019m still available with limited capacity, so it\u2019s always good to know as early as possible if you would like my participation in something.\u00a0\nHave a lovely weekend everyone!\u00a0\n\u00a0\nWarm Greetings, Beste Gr\u00fc\u00dfe, Pozdrawiam!\nBastian K\u00fcntzel \n\u00a0\nwww.incontro-training.org\n+48-696 3666 43 \nMy recent creative outputs:\u00a0\nTEDx Talk\n | \nbook\n | \npodcast\n | \nonline course\nOn 21 Jul 2023 at 02:38 +0200, Tamara Thorpe <\nt.thorpe@lcwmail.com\n>, wrote:\nHello Annelie and Bastian,\n\u00a0\nHope you both are well and enjoying summer!\n\u00a0\nAs you know, Raphelle has been on maternity leave; she gave birth to a healthy baby girl she named Rebecca. She will be back in the office sometime in August. In the interim, we\u2019ve been working closely with her temporary replacement, Ana, who had not been previously involved in our partnership. She has offered some very helpful insights and feedback that we have been implementing as the programme evolves.\n\u00a0\nOne of the more important conversations that we have had have been about scheduling and participation. As you know, we have struggled with scheduling and late cancellations, and low participation in our virtual sessions. As a result, Raashi has gotten involved and has committed to taking greater efforts on their end to ensure less rescheduling and greater participation.\n\u00a0\nOne of the steps Raashi has taken is to have one to one conversations with participants from both the Leaders and HR Upskilling cohorts. In those conversations, Raashi gathered some additional feedback about the facilitated sessions, both content and delivery.\n\u00a0\nWith regards to the HR Upskilling programming, folks are quite pleased with the content and new efforts are going to ensure greater participation. \nThe next cohort is coming up, we will likely kick off in September, Conner will be reaching out to you about facilitation dates soon.\n\u00a0\nFor the Leaders Academy, there was mixed feedback from Raashi and participants. Overall, there is a sense that the experience has declined from cohort to cohort. Feedback was that the content is too theoretical and not focused enough on action. Obviously, this is a content issue which we discussed with Raashi, while also making her aware of the various contributing factors. One of the largest contributing factors is not having enough time in person, and how we have broken up the content. We agreed that for all future cohorts we will have a new format:\nPart 1 Virtual\nPart 2 In person\nPart 3 Virtual\n\u00a0\nWith regards to facilitation, participants expressed that they did not think there were getting tangible takeaways, that they often heard \u201cit depends\u201d, and that they were wanting more guidance from the facilitators. Which, of course, I know is tricky.\n\u00a0\nAdditionally, Raashi and some folks she talked appreciated your dynamic style, but were frustrated with the fact that neither of you were familiar with the eLearning content, and were unprepared to answer their questions as it related to the eLearning. I realize that this was a change in the curriculum with little notice, and we won\u2019t be using it with this population again.\n\u00a0\nUltimately, Raashi\u2019s feeling is that the facilitation isn\u2019t working and she would like us to take a different approach. This may include delivering the training with an internal Ubisoft facilitator who can speak to the specific issues within Ubisoft with greater authority. However, this has not been confirmed. But if this is the case then we think it best that an internal LCW facilitator collaborate with their internal facilitator.\n\u00a0\nThere are two additional Leaders cohorts coming up in October and November,\u00a0 I won\u2019t likely be able to confirm the facilitation needs until Raphaelle returns in August.\n\u00a0\nWe are extending our contract with them to continue to develop programming in 2024 so I\u2019ll keep you posted as things progress.\n\u00a0\nThank you both so much for your being such incredible partners, sharing your expertise and lived experiences, and for being so incredibly patient and flexible with us and Ubisoft.\n\u00a0\nWe look forward to our continued collaboration.\n\u00a0\nTamara and Conner\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\nTamara Thorpe\n(she/her)\nPrincipal Consultant\nLCW\nWebsite\n\u00a0\n|\n\u00a0\nTwitter\n \n|\n\u00a0\nFacebook\n\u00a0\n|\n\u00a0\nLinkedIn\nView our upcoming events\n \n|\n \nSign-up for our newsletter",

She will be reaching out to both of you to get your feedback on Cohort 6, particularly any insights on low attendance for Part 3.\n\u00a0\nI am absolutely aware and 100% in support of having all of our content delivered in person, and it is my hope that as they evaluate Cohorts 1-6m they reconsider the format. Raphaelle meets with Caroline, who is in charge of the format for the Leadership Academy, on Tuesday to discuss feedback and future formats. I\u2019m confident that RL is aware that we would like our entire session delivered in person. We will have to wait to hear from her after she\u2019s met with Caroline on formats for the future.\n\u00a0\nAdditionally, we discussed adjusting the content for Content for Cohort 5, Parts 2 and 3. We want to give them more time for discussion and practice. RL is going to review the content and make recommendations for what she things we can exclude; and Part 2 may look more like what you did for the last on site with Cohort 6. I\u2019ll keep you updated and if you have recommendations, please send them to me.\n\u00a0\nThanks again,\nTamara\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n-\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nTamara Thorpe (she/her)\nPrincipal Consultant, LCW\nEmail: t.thorpe@lcwmail.com\nPhone: +1-773-888-4942\n \n\u00a0\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\nwww\n\u00a0\n|\n\u00a0\nTwitter\n \n|\n\u00a0\nFacebook\n\u00a0\n|\n\u00a0\nLinkedIn\n\u00a0\n \n\u00a0\nTo inspire kindness, deepen\u00a0understanding, and\nfoster equity in\u00a0the communities\u00a0where people\nlive\u00a0and at the organizations where they\u00a0work.",

I appreciate you sending those links over as well.\n\u00a0\nWith regards to the Cohort 6 prework, I sent it to you both on March 2\nnd\n in advance of the session; however, I think the link is no longer live so I\u2019ll request a new one. I understand if it fell under the radar.\n\u00a0\nThe eLearning content has been seen and approved by Raphaelle, and is used with the HR cohorts. I can\u2019t recall off the top of my head what she is referring to, nor do I think it\u2019s as egregious as she\u2019s made it out to be. The eLearnings also have a Resources tab that should include additional information and sources for the content. But I\u2019ll verify and get back to you.\n\u00a0\nWith regards to cancellations, our the cancellation penalty only goes into effect if they are not rescheduled. So unfortunately, the challenge we have is that they perpetually reschedule. I\u2019ve discussed this with Raphaelle, and we haven\u2019t been able to find a strategy. I\u2019ll have to go back to my leadership team to see what we can, in fact, negotiate.\n\u00a0\nI\u2019m meeting with Raphaelle Thursday, the last before her Mat leave, and will discuss Cohort 5 and where she believes content would need to be adjusted. As discussed with Annelie, we no longer have the resources for Ubisoft to continually adapt the content so we will likely make some adjustments but nothing major. Knowing that they\u2019re budgets have been cut, it is highly unlikely that we will be able to negotiate additional spending to adjust content for one cohort. All that being said, I\u2019ll discuss it with her this week and share your recommendations.\n\u00a0\nIf we can meet after my meeting with RL this week, that would be great.\n\u00a0\nTamara\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\nFrom:\n Bastian K\u00fcntzel <bastian@incontro-training.org>\nSent:\n Monday, March 27, 2023 4:39 AM\nTo:\n Tamara Thorpe <t.thorpe@lcwmail.com>; Annelie Wambeek <A.wambeek@lcwmail.com>; Conner Williams <c.williams@lcwmail.com>\nSubject:\n Ubi Follow-Ups\n\u00a0\nHi Tamara and Conner,\u00a0\nJust had a quick call with Annelie to prepare for tonight.

    "body": "Hello Bastian and Annelie,\n\u00a0\nThanks again for the update and the flexibility. I appreciate you sending those links over as well.\n\u00a0\nWith regards to the Cohort 6 prework, I sent it to you both on March 2\nnd\n in advance of the session; however, I think the link is no longer live so I\u2019ll request a new one. I understand if it fell under the radar. \n\u00a0\nThe eLearning content has been seen and approved by Raphaelle, and is used with the HR cohorts. I can\u2019t recall off the top of my head what she is referring to, nor do I think it\u2019s as egregious as she\u2019s made it out to be. The eLearnings also have a Resources tab that should include additional information and sources for the content. But I\u2019ll verify and get back to you.\n\u00a0\nWith regards to cancellations, our the cancellation penalty only goes into effect if they are not rescheduled. So unfortunately, the challenge we have is that they perpetually reschedule. I\u2019ve discussed this with Raphaelle, and we haven\u2019t been able to find a strategy. I\u2019ll have to go back to my leadership team to see what we can, in fact, negotiate.\n\u00a0\nI\u2019m meeting with Raphaelle Thursday, the last before her Mat leave, and will discuss Cohort 5 and where she believes content would need to be adjusted. As discussed with Annelie, we no longer have the resources for Ubisoft to continually adapt the content so we will likely make some adjustments but nothing major. Knowing that they\u2019re budgets have been cut, it is highly unlikely that we will be able to negotiate additional spending to adjust content for one cohort. All that being said, I\u2019ll discuss it with her this week and share your recommendations.\n\u00a0\nIf we can meet after my meeting with RL this week, that would be great. \n\u00a0\nTamara\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\nFrom:\n Bastian K\u00fcntzel <bastian@incontro-training.org> \nSent:\n Monday, March 27, 2023 4:39 AM\nTo:\n Tamara Thorpe <t.thorpe@lcwmail.com>; Annelie Wambeek <A.wambeek@lcwmail.com>; Conner Williams <c.williams@lcwmail.com>\nSubject:\n Ubi Follow-Ups\n\u00a0\nHi Tamara and Conner,\u00a0\nJust had a quick call with Annelie to prepare for tonight. She told me of your call and that reminded me that I actually got some precise feedback from one of the participants on the pre-work materials. One participant said that some of the contents had made her quite mad and so in the break I went over to her to record as specifically as possible what she had taken issue with.\u00a0\nSo in the pre-work on Culture and Identity, on Slide 14 out of 31 there is something on common influences that makes rather sweeping statements on women and girls but without citing any studies or basing this in any context and the participant found this to be very stereotyping and sweeping, which I would agree with. It was very hard for Annelie and I to respond to any of the pre-work material critiques as we had not seen them, but Annelie told me she had addressed that with you.\u00a0\nI recall that I had asked you about your cancellation policy regarding the last minute cancellations of part 2 and 3 for Cohort 5. I don\u2019t think we did get your take on that yet. When we do part 2 and 3 of for Cohort 5, the group that we had in person in January, I don\u2019t think we can do part 2 and 3 as with the other groups as there\u2019s too big of a time gap between the in-person and the follow-through remote sessions. We\u2019ll have to consider that as a whole new thing that needs to be redesigned as a new thing. I think it\u2019s worthwhile negotiating with Ubisoft to consider this as a separate event.\u00a0\n\u00a0\nWarm Greetings, Beste Gr\u00fc\u00dfe, Pozdrawiam!\nBastian K\u00fcntzel \n\u00a0\nwww.incontro-training.org\n+48-696 3666 43 \nMy recent creative outputs:\u00a0\nTEDx Talk\n | \nbook\n | \npodcast\n | \nonline course",
