No designer, no photographer, no creative team. Just me and ChatGPT.\nHere\u2019s how it went:\nI opened ChatGPT, selected GPT-4o, and typed the prompt: \u201cGive me an ad concept for a new healthy drink that gives you probiotics and has no sugar.\u201d Here\u2019s what it gave me:\nIntroducing: \nPurebiotics\n \u2014 The refreshing drink that boosts your gut health without a single grain of sugar.\n\ud83e\udd64 Probiotics-powered \u2013 Supports digestion, immunity, and overall wellness\n\ud83d\udeab 0 Sugar, 0 Guilt \u2013 Sweetened naturally, no artificial stuff ever\n\ud83c\udf31 Clean Ingredients \u2013 Plant-based, non-GMO, and crafted with care\n\ud83d\udca7 Light. Crisp. Alive. \u2013 A sparkling sip that makes wellness taste amazing\nFuel your body. Feed your gut.\nDrink Purebiotics. Feel the difference.\nI liked the concept, so next I asked ChatGPT to turn it into an Instagram ad. \nI refined the prompt about four times, zeroing in on the details \u2014 until I got something I liked: a woman walking out of the gym, drinking Purebiotics. That\u2019s the image on the left (above).\nThen I pushed it a bit further. I wrote: \u201cNow make a similar one with two friends talking \u2014 one Asian \u2014 and walking down a street in Manhattan after the gym. One of them is drinking this drink.\u201d\nBoom \u2014 it gave me the second image (on the right).\nAll this took about five minutes.\nHey, I know. Are these the best ads ever? No. But they\u2019re pretty good for zero budget and no human involvement apart from mine.\nI didn\u2019t have to hire a copy editor, a photographer, three models, make a prototype bottle, or set up lighting. You name it \u2014 I pretty much didn\u2019t have to do it.\nI just opened ChatGPT after walking the dog and made two ads while drinking my morning coffee.\nThis is not a gimmick \u2014 it\u2019s a signal.\nA big part of how marketing teams operate is about to change. Content creation, especially at scale, is becoming faster, cheaper, and way more accessible with AI.\nIf you\u2019re in marketing, comms, or creative strategy, \nlearn how to prompt\n. \n\"Prompting\" refers to the art of writing clear instructions for AI systems - essentially telling the AI exactly what you want it to create.\nAI won\u2019t replace your talent \u2014 it will multiply it. And yes, a real marketer will absolutely get better results than I did. But that\u2019s the point: with the right skills, this tech becomes a serious competitive advantage. \n\u00a0 \nBefore You Buy Your House, Look 30 Years Ahead with AlphaGeo\nClimate change is quietly redrawing the map of where it\u2019s safe \u2014 and smart \u2014 to live and invest.\nFrom wildfires to rising insurance costs, the impact is no longer hypothetical. \nThe New York Times\n recently shared a guide for homebuyers to avoid high-risk areas. But for most people, navigating that kind of complexity is daunting.\nThat\u2019s why I\u2019m excited about what my husband Parag is building at AlphaGeo.\nLet\u2019s say you\u2019re considering buying a home, opening an office, or investing in land. AlphaGeo helps you look beyond today and understand what that location might look like 10, 20, or 50 years from now. \n\ud83d\ude0e \nIt shows you:\nThe climate risks that could affect the area \u2014 like floods, droughts, or hurricanes\nHow resilient the location is, based on local infrastructure, adaptation efforts, and planning\nWhat your future insurance, utilities, or maintenance costs might look like\nAnd how all of this could shape the property\u2019s long-term value\nAlphaGeo has built a dataset of 60 billion datapoints covering every coordinate on the globe and providing 20 actionable indicators that measure any location's climate risk, adaptation capacity to offset those risks, and predictions of insurance premiums and other expenses. It then uses AI in predicting valuations.\nWhy it matters: \nClimate change is expected to destroy $1.5 trillion in US home value over the next 30 years. This loss will be uneven \u2014 driven by specific risks like flooding, wildfire, and extreme heat in certain locations. Investing smartly by identifying which places are vulnerable and which are adapting, is going to be essential for protecting long-term value.\nClick here\n to see if your home is in the safe zone (use your work email) or learn more: \nwww.alphageo.ai\n\u00a0 \nWOMAN IN TECH\nMeet Dr. Iman Abuzeid, CEO of Incredible Health\nCelebrating this week's Woman in Tech \n\ud83e\udd73\n: \nMeet Dr. Iman Abuzeid, CEO and co-founder of Incredible Health\n, and only the fourth Black woman to lead a billion-dollar company. \nBorn in Saudi Arabia to Sudanese parents, Dr. Abuzeid grew up surrounded by medicine\u2014her father and brothers are all surgeons. She earned her medical degree from University College London, then moved to the US and completed her MBA at The Wharton School.\nWhile working in consulting and health tech, Dr. Abuzeid saw a disconnect: hospitals struggling to find nurses, and nurses struggling to find good jobs. In 2017, she co-founded Incredible Health to fix both sides of the problem:\nUnlike traditional job boards, Incredible Health flips the hiring process: \nhealthcare employers apply to nurses\n, not the other way around.\nThe platform uses AI to match nurses with roles that fit their experience, preferences, and location.\nThis reduces hiring time from the national average of 90 days to \njust 20\n, helping hospitals fill critical roles faster and giving nurses better opportunities.\nToday, Incredible Health is used by over 1,500 hospitals and 1 million nurses across the US. The platform reached a $1.65 billion valuation in 2022, and saves hospitals an average of $2 million per year.\nDr. Abuzeid\u2019s work for nurses and hospitals has earned her recognition in TIME\u2019s Next 2024 list, as well as Forbes\u2019 America\u2019s Richest Self Made Women list in 2023. \n\ud83e\udd17 \n\u00a0 \nUntil next time! \nAyesha \u2764\ufe0f \nps.

As AI professor Kate Devlin pointed out, self-reported data can miss the nuance of how people truly feel.\nStill, it\u2019s a meaningful first step in measuring what effect AI companions have on our social lives.\n\u00a0 \nDisney\u2019s New Robot Looks Like It\u2019s Alive\nThese two small robots became unexpected stars at Nvidia\u2019s GTC 2025 conference.\nInspired by Star Wars, \n\u201cBesh and Grek\u201d are real-life droids built by Disney Imagineering\n. They can walk, turn, and respond with a level of coordination and timing that\u2019s noticeably smooth. Their subtle, lifelike movements and pauses made them stand out to many in the audience.\nThe droids were developed using Newton, Nvidia\u2019s new physics engine developed in collaboration with Google DeepMind and Disney Research. \nWhat makes Newton different? At the center of the physics engine is something called a \ndigital twin \n\u2014 a virtual version of the robot that can be trained \nentirely in simulation\n. Before the physical droid ever takes a step, its digital twin practices walking, reacting, and interacting in a virtual environment that mirrors real-world physics.\nHere\u2019s how it works:\nThe digital twin attempts tasks like walking across a floor or reacting to someone nearby.\nNewton calculates what would happen in the real world, down to how the robot\u2019s weight shifts or how fast it turns.\nOver time, the robot learns what works and what doesn\u2019t \u2014 and \nonly once it\u2019s reliable enough in simulation does it move to the real world\n.\nTo make the Disney droids feel more human, the creative team at Disney first sketched out how emotions like shyness or curiosity should look on the robots, down to specific gestures and facial cues. Then, using Newton, the virtual models were trained to perform those expressions physically, with lifelike movement and timing.\nNvidia sees potential far beyond entertainment for Newton; the company estimates the market for simulation-trained robots could reach \n$10 trillion\n. This would include applications in healthcare, logistics, and manufacturing \u2014 any setting where reliability matters and physical trial-and-error is too risky or expensive. \nIt would be exciting to see these robots act in films as well. Their lifelike movements could bring characters to life without relying so much on CGI.\n\u00a0 \nYour Photos Could Save Japan\u2019s Cherry Blossoms\nEach spring, millions gather under Japan\u2019s cherry blossoms\u2014snapping photos and sipping drinks. The tradition, \nknown as hanami\n, is all about slowing down and enjoying the blossoms with friends, food, and good weather.\nBut behind the scenes, many of these iconic trees are quietly aging out. Most were planted after WWII, and now, decades later, local governments are struggling to keep them healthy with limited budgets and staff.\nTo support these trees, Japanese beverage company Kirin Brewery \nhas launched Sakura AI Camera, a free tool that lets anyone take a photo of a cherry tree and get an instant health check\n. The AI looks at trunk size and shape to estimate age and vitality, then shares the data with local officials so they know which trees need care.\nThe company hopes to turn casual springtime moments into acts of conservation, helping more people take part in preserving cherry blossoms and keeping the tradition alive for generations to come. \n\ud83c\udf38 \nWhat do you think of this approach?\nWould you take photos to help save cherry blossom trees?\nAbsolutely! Happy to trade one snap for a thousand blossoms. \ud83d\udcf8 \nMaybe, if I'm already taking pictures anyway. \ud83e\udd14 \nNo thanks, I don't want my stroll to turn into a science project! \ud83c\udf38 \n\u00a0 \nLearn how to navigate, lead, and innovate in an AI-first world\nCohort 5 of my Generative AI for Business Executives course is now live. \nStep into the future of business \u2014 \nEnroll now\n\u00a0 \nLATELY\nArticles I\u2019ve Been Reading:\nFuriosaAI, a Korean startup making AI chips, \nhas turned down an $800 million offer from Meta\n. \ud83e\udd2f Instead of being acquired, the company wants to grow on its own and eventually go public. \nThe company\u2019s latest chip, called RNGD, is designed for AI inferencing\u2014the process of running trained AI models to generate results. It\u2019s Furiosa\u2019s answer to Nvidia\u2019s chips, which dominate this space today. \nRNGD is already being tested by companies like LG and Saudi Aramco. It\u2019s built using advanced manufacturing from TSMC, the world\u2019s largest chipmaker, and high-speed memory from SK Hynix\u2014both crucial for delivering the performance needed to compete with industry giants. \nMeta, which is investing heavily in its own AI infrastructure, saw Furiosa as a potential strategic fit. But with growing customer interest and a funding round that\u2019s already ahead of target, Furiosa believes it\u2019s better positioned to grow on its own. \n\u00a0 \nPs.

Southeast Asia alone represents 100+ ethnic groups and a population of 655 million people who speak more than 1,000 different languages and dialects. Proactively make sure that the way we recruit, hire, and develop our talent is equitable and bias-free. \nWomen\n: According to Equileap\u2019s Gender Equality in Asia Pacific report, women make up only 17% of boards of directors, 4% of CEOS, and 26% of senior managers. How can we make sure we evaluate women\u2019s performance fairly? \nColorism (light skin preference)\n is the practice of favouring lighter skin over darker skin, particularly within the same ethnic group. People with fairer skin are seen as more beautiful and tend to receive better treatment by society and institutions. How can we avoid unconsciously giving people with lighter skin fewer development opportunities? \nClass/socioeconomic status\n: Are we unconsciously giving people from wealthier socioeconomic backgrounds more attention, more credibility, more development opportunities, more airtime? What could we do to proactively keep this in mind the next time we\u2019re making a people decision?\nCaste: \nCaste systems categorize people into hierarchical social groups and are based on a person\u2019s job/occupation and descent. While no longer legal, people\u2019s perceived caste still often influences how they are treated. What could we do to proactively keep this in mind the next time we\u2019re making a people decision?\n\u00a0\nTo lead inclusively at Boston Scientific, I will:\nExpand my circle of \u201cgo-to\u201d people. \nCreate opportunities for less talkative/extroverted people to demonstrate their capabilities.\nCheck against affinity bias or confirmation bias when I say a team member is not the \u201cright fit.\u201d\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \nIdentify high performers based on objective, consistent criteria. \nMentor or sponsor talent of varying backgrounds (not just those who are similar to me).\nBe intentional about ensuring the people in my networks are culturally- and gender-diverse. \nGive my discretionary time to a variety of people at BSC, not just those who are high performers or with whom I feel comfortable. \n\u00a0\nUp groups or \u201cin groups\u201d in organizations\u2026\nTend to have access to power, control, and information \nTend to unconsciously rely on stereotypes \nTend to not think too much about their membership in an \u201cin group\u201d\nWhat are some \u201cin groups\u201d within Boston Scientific?\n \nDown groups or \u201cout groups\u201d in organizations\u2026\nHave less power, control, and information\nTend to experience extra scrutiny, stereotypes, and confirmation bias\nAre susceptible to \nstereotype threat\n, where anxiety about confirming negative stereotypes can precipitate self-doubt, and sometimes ends up hindering their ability to perform confidently and at their maximum level.\nTend to be very aware of being in an \u201cout group\u201d\nWhat are some \u201cout groups\u201d within Boston Scientific?\n\u00a0\nRemember\u2026 \u201cin groups\u201d can be \u201cout groups\u201d in different contexts. \n\u00a0\nIt\u2019s our job as people leaders to create a culture where all team members feel like they\u2019re part of your \u201cin group\u201d - heard, respected, understood, and like their contributions matter.

Southeast Asia alone represents 100+ ethnic groups and a population of 655 million people who speak more than 1,000 different languages and dialects. Proactively make sure that the way we recruit, hire, and develop our talent is equitable and bias-free. \nWomen\n: According to Equileap\u2019s Gender Equality in Asia Pacific report, women make up only 17% of boards of directors, 4% of CEOS, and 26% of senior managers. How can we make sure we evaluate women\u2019s performance fairly? \nColorism (light skin preference)\n is the practice of favouring lighter skin over darker skin, particularly within the same ethnic group. People with fairer skin are seen as more beautiful and tend to receive better treatment by society and institutions. How can we avoid unconsciously giving people with lighter skin fewer development opportunities? \nClass/socioeconomic status\n: Are we unconsciously giving people from wealthier socioeconomic backgrounds more attention, more credibility, more development opportunities, more airtime? What could we do to proactively keep this in mind the next time we\u2019re making a people decision?\nCaste: \nCaste systems categorize people into hierarchical social groups and are based on a person\u2019s job/occupation and descent. While no longer legal, people\u2019s perceived caste still often influences how they are treated. What could we do to proactively keep this in mind the next time we\u2019re making a people decision?\n\u00a0\nTo lead inclusively at Boston Scientific, I will:\nExpand my circle of \u201cgo-to\u201d people. \nCreate opportunities for less talkative/extroverted people to demonstrate their capabilities.\nCheck against affinity bias or confirmation bias when I say a team member is not the \u201cright fit.\u201d\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \nIdentify high performers based on objective, consistent criteria. \nMentor or sponsor talent of varying backgrounds (not just those who are similar to me).\nBe intentional about ensuring the people in my networks are culturally- and gender-diverse. \nGive my discretionary time to a variety of people at BSC, not just those who are high performers or with whom I feel comfortable. \n\u00a0\nUp groups or \u201cin groups\u201d in organizations\u2026\nTend to have access to power, control, and information \nTend to unconsciously rely on stereotypes \nTend to not think too much about their membership in an \u201cin group\u201d\nWhat are some \u201cin groups\u201d within Boston Scientific?\n \nDown groups or \u201cout groups\u201d in organizations\u2026\nHave less power, control, and information\nTend to experience extra scrutiny, stereotypes, and confirmation bias\nAre susceptible to \nstereotype threat\n, where anxiety about confirming negative stereotypes can precipitate self-doubt, and sometimes ends up hindering their ability to perform confidently and at their maximum level.\nTend to be very aware of being in an \u201cout group\u201d\nWhat are some \u201cout groups\u201d within Boston Scientific?\n\u00a0\nRemember\u2026 \u201cin groups\u201d can be \u201cout groups\u201d in different contexts. \n\u00a0\nIt\u2019s our job as people leaders to create a culture where all team members feel like they\u2019re part of your \u201cin group\u201d - heard, respected, understood, and like their contributions matter.

Southeast Asia alone represents 100+ ethnic groups and a population of 655 million people who speak more than 1,000 different languages and dialects. Proactively make sure that the way we recruit, hire, and develop our talent is equitable and bias-free. \nWomen\n: According to Equileap\u2019s Gender Equality in Asia Pacific report, women make up only 17% of boards of directors, 4% of CEOS, and 26% of senior managers. How can we make sure we evaluate women\u2019s performance fairly? \nColorism (light skin preference)\n is the practice of favouring lighter skin over darker skin, particularly within the same ethnic group. People with fairer skin are seen as more beautiful and tend to receive better treatment by society and institutions. How can we avoid unconsciously giving people with lighter skin fewer development opportunities? \nClass/socioeconomic status\n: Are we unconsciously giving people from wealthier socioeconomic backgrounds more attention, more credibility, more development opportunities, more airtime? What could we do to proactively keep this in mind the next time we\u2019re making a people decision?\nCaste: \nCaste systems categorize people into hierarchical social groups and are based on a person\u2019s job/occupation and descent.

Much of the content is the same, and you can copy from the document you\u2019ve already created. \n\u00a0\nI gathered the main takeaways from \nthis workshop\n and wrote them out below. Do you think it\u2019s possible to have a draft by Friday or Monda\ny?\n\u00a0\nPlease note that I\u2019ve made some tweaks in the language from the Canada version \u2013 some parts are not exactly the same. \n\u00a0\nThank you so very much!\n \n\u00a0\n\u00a0\nDiversity:\n The \ncomposition\n of our team. The different life experiences that exist in our team.\nInclusion:\n What we \nproactively do\n to engage the diversity in our team. Making our team feel understood, respected, and part of the team. \n\u00a0\n\u00a0\nKey Reflection Questions for Driving Inclusion on Your Team\nBUILD\nConsider the diverse talent at your location\u2026\n\u00b7\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \nWho has been\n well-represented\n?\n\u00b7\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \nWhose voice has been\u00a0noticeably \nunder-represented, or even \nun\nrepresented\n?\nBELONG\n\u00b7\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \nWhat \nactions\n have you\u00a0taken personally as a leader \nto foster a sense of belonging\n on your team?\n\u00b7\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \nHow have you engaged your team\n and leveraged their unique talents?\nADVANCE\nWhat have you done\u00a0to make sure your historically excluded talent have \naccess to the opportunities, relationships and networks\n they need to succeed and advance?\n\u00a0\nValuing Diversity in Asia Pacific\nRacial and ethnic minorities:\n There are hundreds of ethnic groups across Asia Pacific. Southeast Asia alone represents 100+ ethnic groups and a population of 655 million people who speak more than 1,000 different languages and dialects. Proactively make sure that the way we recruit, hire, and develop our talent is equitable and bias-free. \nWomen\n: According to Equileap\u2019s Gender Equality in Asia Pacific report, women make up only 17% of boards of directors, 4% of CEOS, and 26% of senior managers. How can we make sure we evaluate women\u2019s performance fairly? \nColorism (light skin preference)\n is the practice of favouring lighter skin over darker skin, particularly within the same ethnic group. People with fairer skin are seen as more beautiful and tend to receive better treatment by society and institutions. How can we avoid unconsciously giving people with lighter skin fewer development opportunities? \nClass/socioeconomic status\n: Are we unconsciously giving people from wealthier socioeconomic backgrounds more attention, more credibility, more development opportunities, more airtime? What could we do to proactively keep this in mind the next time we\u2019re making a people decision?\nCaste: \nCaste systems categorize people into hierarchical social groups and are based on a person\u2019s job/occupation and descent. While no longer legal, people\u2019s perceived caste still often influences how they are treated. What could we do to proactively keep this in mind the next time we\u2019re making a people decision?\n\u00a0\nTo lead inclusively at Boston Scientific, I will:\nExpand my circle of \u201cgo-to\u201d people. \nCreate opportunities for less talkative/extroverted people to demonstrate their capabilities.\nCheck against affinity bias or confirmation bias when I say a team member is not the \u201cright fit.\u201d\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \nIdentify high performers based on objective, consistent criteria. \nMentor or sponsor talent of varying backgrounds (not just those who are similar to me).\nBe intentional about ensuring the people in my networks are culturally- and gender-diverse. \nGive my discretionary time to a variety of people at BSC, not just those who are high performers or with whom I feel comfortable. \n\u00a0\nUp groups or \u201cin groups\u201d in organizations\u2026\nTend to have access to power, control, and information \nTend to unconsciously rely on stereotypes \nTend to not think too much about their membership in an \u201cin group\u201d\nWhat are some \u201cin groups\u201d within Boston Scientific?\n \nDown groups or \u201cout groups\u201d in organizations\u2026\nHave less power, control, and information\nTend to experience extra scrutiny, stereotypes, and confirmation bias\nAre susceptible to \nstereotype threat\n, where anxiety about confirming negative stereotypes can precipitate self-doubt, and sometimes ends up hindering their ability to perform confidently and at their maximum level.\nTend to be very aware of being in an \u201cout group\u201d\nWhat are some \u201cout groups\u201d within Boston Scientific?\n\u00a0\nRemember\u2026 \u201cin groups\u201d can be \u201cout groups\u201d in different contexts. \n\u00a0\nIt\u2019s our job as people leaders to create a culture where all team members feel like they\u2019re part of your \u201cin group\u201d - heard, respected, understood, and like their contributions matter. Only then can exceptional performance be expected!\n\u00a0\nCoded language: \nWords or phrases that may appear neutral or harmless on the surface but carry underlying biases which can influence perceptions and opportunities in the workplace.\n\u00a0 \nExamples:\n\u201cHe lacks executive presence\u201d or \u201clacks polish\u201d\n\u201cShe\u2019s not a cultural fit here\u201d\n(To a Black colleague): \u201cWow, you\u2019re so articulate\u201d\n\u201cYou have an aggressive communication style\u201d\n\u201cHer hair style could have been more professional\u201d\n\u201cZara was a diversity hire\u201d\n\u00a0\nConcrete actions you can take to lead inclusively\nBuild Awareness, Listen Actively, Inclusive Environment\nEmpower Team, Value Contributions, Encourage Diverse Perspectives\nProvide Quality Feedback, Equity in Evaluations, Self-Awareness\n\u2022\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \nHave inclusive conversations by asking open-ended questions and listening deeply\n\u2022\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \nLearn about unconscious biases and their impact on decision-making.\n\u2022\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \nBuild cultural literacy on unfamiliar cultures; understand different work, communication, and conflict resolution styles.\n\u2022\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \nGive full attention and understanding before responding.\n\u2022\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \nAsk clarifying questions and confirm understanding.\n\u2022\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \nCreate a culture where team members feel safe expressing diverse opinions without fear of embarrassment.\n\u2022\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \nRotate the order of speakers in meetings to make sure everyone has a chance to contribute.\n\u00a0\n\u2022\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \nMake sure everyone has the resources needed for success.\n\u2022\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \nCreate conditions for team members to take risks and make their own decisions.\n\u2022\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \nProactively engage team members rather than waiting for them to speak up.\n\u2022\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \nThank and recognise team members in ways that are meaningful to them.\n\u2022\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \nPublicly highlight accomplishments, especially for those who are less vocal.\n\u2022\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \nActively seek out diverse viewpoints when making decisions or solving problems.\n\u2022\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \nEncourage ideas that challenge the status quo and demonstrate appreciation for novel suggestions.\n\u00a0\n\u2022\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \nOffer specific, actionable feedback that focuses on behaviour, not personal judgment.\n\u2022\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \nMake sure feedback is delivered in culturally competent ways.\n\u2022\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \nBuild trust by following through on feedback and advice received from others.\n\u2022\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \nReview hiring practices and ensure job descriptions are inclusive.\n\u2022\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \nRegularly review performance criteria to ensure they are fair and equitable for all backgrounds.\n\u2022\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \nResist judgment, recognizing that you may not fully see others' challenges.\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\nSample questions for inclusive conversations: \nWhat is a \u201cperfect\u201d day for you in your job?

LMK if I missed anything or anything needs to be changed. \n\u00a0\nHave a great weekend!\n\u00a0\n~Keri\n\u00a0\nFrom:\n Rebecca Parrilla <r.parrilla@lcwmail.com> \nSent:\n Thursday, March 20, 2025 1:27 PM\nTo:\n Keri Luo <k.luo@lcwmail.com>\nSubject:\n Another fillable pdf for Boston Scientific? \n\ud83d\ude0a\n\u00a0\nHi Keri, how are you?\nWe need to create a fillable pdf for Boston Scientific\u2019s \u201cLeading Inclusively in APAC\u201d (similar to \nthe one you created for Canada\n). Much of the content is the same, and you can copy from the document you\u2019ve already created. \n\u00a0\nI gathered the main takeaways from \nthis workshop\n and wrote them out below. Do you think it\u2019s possible to have a draft by Friday or Monda\ny?\n\u00a0\nPlease note that I\u2019ve made some tweaks in the language from the Canada version \u2013 some parts are not exactly the same. \n\u00a0\nThank you so very much!\n \n\u00a0\n\u00a0\nDiversity:\n The \ncomposition\n of our team. The different life experiences that exist in our team.\nInclusion:\n What we \nproactively do\n to engage the diversity in our team. Making our team feel understood, respected, and part of the team. \n\u00a0\n\u00a0\nKey Reflection Questions for Driving Inclusion on Your Team\nBUILD\nConsider the diverse talent at your location\u2026\n\u00b7\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \nWho has been\n well-represented\n?\n\u00b7\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \nWhose voice has been\u00a0noticeably \nunder-represented, or even \nun\nrepresented\n?\nBELONG\n\u00b7\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \nWhat \nactions\n have you\u00a0taken personally as a leader \nto foster a sense of belonging\n on your team?\n\u00b7\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \nHow have you engaged your team\n and leveraged their unique talents?\nADVANCE\nWhat have you done\u00a0to make sure your historically excluded talent have \naccess to the opportunities, relationships and networks\n they need to succeed and advance?\n\u00a0\nValuing Diversity in Asia Pacific\nRacial and ethnic minorities:\n There are hundreds of ethnic groups across Asia Pacific. Southeast Asia alone represents 100+ ethnic groups and a population of 655 million people who speak more than 1,000 different languages and dialects. Proactively make sure that the way we recruit, hire, and develop our talent is equitable and bias-free. \nWomen\n: According to Equileap\u2019s Gender Equality in Asia Pacific report, women make up only 17% of boards of directors, 4% of CEOS, and 26% of senior managers. How can we make sure we evaluate women\u2019s performance fairly? \nColorism (light skin preference)\n is the practice of favouring lighter skin over darker skin, particularly within the same ethnic group. People with fairer skin are seen as more beautiful and tend to receive better treatment by society and institutions. How can we avoid unconsciously giving people with lighter skin fewer development opportunities? \nClass/socioeconomic status\n: Are we unconsciously giving people from wealthier socioeconomic backgrounds more attention, more credibility, more development opportunities, more airtime? What could we do to proactively keep this in mind the next time we\u2019re making a people decision?\nCaste: \nCaste systems categorize people into hierarchical social groups and are based on a person\u2019s job/occupation and descent. While no longer legal, people\u2019s perceived caste still often influences how they are treated. What could we do to proactively keep this in mind the next time we\u2019re making a people decision?\n\u00a0\nTo lead inclusively at Boston Scientific, I will:\nExpand my circle of \u201cgo-to\u201d people. \nCreate opportunities for less talkative/extroverted people to demonstrate their capabilities.\nCheck against affinity bias or confirmation bias when I say a team member is not the \u201cright fit.\u201d\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \nIdentify high performers based on objective, consistent criteria. \nMentor or sponsor talent of varying backgrounds (not just those who are similar to me).\nBe intentional about ensuring the people in my networks are culturally- and gender-diverse. \nGive my discretionary time to a variety of people at BSC, not just those who are high performers or with whom I feel comfortable. \n\u00a0\nUp groups or \u201cin groups\u201d in organizations\u2026\nTend to have access to power, control, and information \nTend to unconsciously rely on stereotypes \nTend to not think too much about their membership in an \u201cin group\u201d\nWhat are some \u201cin groups\u201d within Boston Scientific?\n \nDown groups or \u201cout groups\u201d in organizations\u2026\nHave less power, control, and information\nTend to experience extra scrutiny, stereotypes, and confirmation bias\nAre susceptible to \nstereotype threat\n, where anxiety about confirming negative stereotypes can precipitate self-doubt, and sometimes ends up hindering their ability to perform confidently and at their maximum level.\nTend to be very aware of being in an \u201cout group\u201d\nWhat are some \u201cout groups\u201d within Boston Scientific?\n\u00a0\nRemember\u2026 \u201cin groups\u201d can be \u201cout groups\u201d in different contexts. \n\u00a0\nIt\u2019s our job as people leaders to create a culture where all team members feel like they\u2019re part of your \u201cin group\u201d - heard, respected, understood, and like their contributions matter. Only then can exceptional performance be expected!\n\u00a0\nCoded language: \nWords or phrases that may appear neutral or harmless on the surface but carry underlying biases which can influence perceptions and opportunities in the workplace.\n\u00a0 \nExamples:\n\u201cHe lacks executive presence\u201d or \u201clacks polish\u201d\n\u201cShe\u2019s not a cultural fit here\u201d\n(To a Black colleague): \u201cWow, you\u2019re so articulate\u201d\n\u201cYou have an aggressive communication style\u201d\n\u201cHer hair style could have been more professional\u201d\n\u201cZara was a diversity hire\u201d\n\u00a0\nConcrete actions you can take to lead inclusively\nBuild Awareness, Listen Actively, Inclusive Environment\nEmpower Team, Value Contributions, Encourage Diverse Perspectives\nProvide Quality Feedback, Equity in Evaluations, Self-Awareness\n\u2022\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \nHave inclusive conversations by asking open-ended questions and listening deeply\n\u2022\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \nLearn about unconscious biases and their impact on decision-making.\n\u2022\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \nBuild cultural literacy on unfamiliar cultures; understand different work, communication, and conflict resolution styles.\n\u2022\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \nGive full attention and understanding before responding.\n\u2022\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \nAsk clarifying questions and confirm understanding.\n\u2022\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \nCreate a culture where team members feel safe expressing diverse opinions without fear of embarrassment.\n\u2022\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \nRotate the order of speakers in meetings to make sure everyone has a chance to contribute.\n\u00a0\n\u2022\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \nMake sure everyone has the resources needed for success.\n\u2022\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \nCreate conditions for team members to take risks and make their own decisions.\n\u2022\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \nProactively engage team members rather than waiting for them to speak up.\n\u2022\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \nThank and recognise team members in ways that are meaningful to them.\n\u2022\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \nPublicly highlight accomplishments, especially for those who are less vocal.\n\u2022\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \nActively seek out diverse viewpoints when making decisions or solving problems.\n\u2022\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \nEncourage ideas that challenge the status quo and demonstrate appreciation for novel suggestions.\n\u00a0\n\u2022\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \nOffer specific, actionable feedback that focuses on behaviour, not personal judgment.\n\u2022\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \nMake sure feedback is delivered in culturally competent ways.\n\u2022\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \nBuild trust by following through on feedback and advice received from others.\n\u2022\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \nReview hiring practices and ensure job descriptions are inclusive.\n\u2022\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \nRegularly review performance criteria to ensure they are fair and equitable for all backgrounds.\n\u2022\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \nResist judgment, recognizing that you may not fully see others' challenges.\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\nSample questions for inclusive conversations: \nWhat is a \u201cperfect\u201d day for you in your job?

Southeast Asia alone represents 100+ ethnic groups and a population of 655 million people who speak more than 1,000 different languages and dialects. Proactively make sure that the way we recruit, hire, and develop our talent is equitable and bias-free. \nWomen\n: According to Equileap\u2019s Gender Equality in Asia Pacific report, women make up only 17% of boards of directors, 4% of CEOS, and 26% of senior managers. How can we make sure we evaluate women\u2019s performance fairly? \nColorism (light skin preference)\n is the practice of favouring lighter skin over darker skin, particularly within the same ethnic group. People with fairer skin are seen as more beautiful and tend to receive better treatment by society and institutions. How can we avoid unconsciously giving people with lighter skin fewer development opportunities? \nClass/socioeconomic status\n: Are we unconsciously giving people from wealthier socioeconomic backgrounds more attention, more credibility, more development opportunities, more airtime? What could we do to proactively keep this in mind the next time we\u2019re making a people decision?\nCaste: \nCaste systems categorize people into hierarchical social groups and are based on a person\u2019s job/occupation and descent. While no longer legal, people\u2019s perceived caste still often influences how they are treated. What could we do to proactively keep this in mind the next time we\u2019re making a people decision?\n\u00a0\nTo lead inclusively at Boston Scientific, I will:\nExpand my circle of \u201cgo-to\u201d people. \nCreate opportunities for less talkative/extroverted people to demonstrate their capabilities.\nCheck against affinity bias or confirmation bias when I say a team member is not the \u201cright fit.\u201d\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \nIdentify high performers based on objective, consistent criteria. \nMentor or sponsor talent of varying backgrounds (not just those who are similar to me).\nBe intentional about ensuring the people in my networks are culturally- and gender-diverse. \nGive my discretionary time to a variety of people at BSC, not just those who are high performers or with whom I feel comfortable. \n\u00a0\nUp groups or \u201cin groups\u201d in organizations\u2026\nTend to have access to power, control, and information \nTend to unconsciously rely on stereotypes \nTend to not think too much about their membership in an \u201cin group\u201d\nWhat are some \u201cin groups\u201d within Boston Scientific?\n \nDown groups or \u201cout groups\u201d in organizations\u2026\nHave less power, control, and information\nTend to experience extra scrutiny, stereotypes, and confirmation bias\nAre susceptible to \nstereotype threat\n, where anxiety about confirming negative stereotypes can precipitate self-doubt, and sometimes ends up hindering their ability to perform confidently and at their maximum level.\nTend to be very aware of being in an \u201cout group\u201d\nWhat are some \u201cout groups\u201d within Boston Scientific?\n\u00a0\nRemember\u2026 \u201cin groups\u201d can be \u201cout groups\u201d in different contexts. \n\u00a0\nIt\u2019s our job as people leaders to create a culture where all team members feel like they\u2019re part of your \u201cin group\u201d - heard, respected, understood, and like their contributions matter. Only then can exceptional performance be expected!\n\u00a0\nCoded language: \nWords or phrases that may appear neutral or harmless on the surface but carry underlying biases which can influence perceptions and opportunities in the workplace.\n\u00a0 \nExamples:\n\u201cHe lacks executive presence\u201d or \u201clacks polish\u201d\n\u201cShe\u2019s not a cultural fit here\u201d\n(To a Black colleague): \u201cWow, you\u2019re so articulate\u201d\n\u201cYou have an aggressive communication style\u201d\n\u201cHer hair style could have been more professional\u201d\n\u201cZara was a diversity hire\u201d\n\u00a0\nConcrete actions you can take to lead inclusively\nBuild Awareness, Listen Actively, Inclusive Environment\nEmpower Team, Value Contributions, Encourage Diverse Perspectives\nProvide Quality Feedback, Equity in Evaluations, Self-Awareness\n\u2022\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \nHave inclusive conversations by asking open-ended questions and listening deeply\n\u2022\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \nLearn about unconscious biases and their impact on decision-making.\n\u2022\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \nBuild cultural literacy on unfamiliar cultures; understand different work, communication, and conflict resolution styles.\n\u2022\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \nGive full attention and understanding before responding.\n\u2022\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \nAsk clarifying questions and confirm understanding.\n\u2022\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \nCreate a culture where team members feel safe expressing diverse opinions without fear of embarrassment.\n\u2022\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \nRotate the order of speakers in meetings to make sure everyone has a chance to contribute.\n\u00a0\n\u2022\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \nMake sure everyone has the resources needed for success.\n\u2022\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \nCreate conditions for team members to take risks and make their own decisions.\n\u2022\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \nProactively engage team members rather than waiting for them to speak up.\n\u2022\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \nThank and recognise team members in ways that are meaningful to them.\n\u2022\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \nPublicly highlight accomplishments, especially for those who are less vocal.\n\u2022\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \nActively seek out diverse viewpoints when making decisions or solving problems.\n\u2022\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \nEncourage ideas that challenge the status quo and demonstrate appreciation for novel suggestions.\n\u00a0\n\u2022\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \nOffer specific, actionable feedback that focuses on behaviour, not personal judgment.\n\u2022\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \nMake sure feedback is delivered in culturally competent ways.\n\u2022\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \nBuild trust by following through on feedback and advice received from others.\n\u2022\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \nReview hiring practices and ensure job descriptions are inclusive.\n\u2022\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \nRegularly review performance criteria to ensure they are fair and equitable for all backgrounds.\n\u2022\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \nResist judgment, recognizing that you may not fully see others' challenges.\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\nSample questions for inclusive conversations: \nWhat is a \u201cperfect\u201d day for you in your job?

Proactively make sure that the way we recruit, hire, and develop our talent is equitable and bias-free. \nWomen\n: According to Equileap\u2019s Gender Equality in Asia Pacific report, women make up only 17% of boards of directors, 4% of CEOS, and 26% of senior managers. How can we make sure we evaluate women\u2019s performance fairly? \nColorism (light skin preference)\n is the practice of favouring lighter skin over darker skin, particularly within the same ethnic group. People with fairer skin are seen as more beautiful and tend to receive better treatment by society and institutions. How can we avoid unconsciously giving people with lighter skin fewer development opportunities? \nClass/socioeconomic status\n: Are we unconsciously giving people from wealthier socioeconomic backgrounds more attention, more credibility, more development opportunities, more airtime? What could we do to proactively keep this in mind the next time we\u2019re making a people decision?\nCaste: \nCaste systems categorize people into hierarchical social groups and are based on a person\u2019s job/occupation and descent. While no longer legal, people\u2019s perceived caste still often influences how they are treated. What could we do to proactively keep this in mind the next time we\u2019re making a people decision?\n\u00a0\nTo lead inclusively at Boston Scientific, I will:\nExpand my circle of \u201cgo-to\u201d people. \nCreate opportunities for less talkative/extroverted people to demonstrate their capabilities.\nCheck against affinity bias or confirmation bias when I say a team member is not the \u201cright fit.\u201d\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \nIdentify high performers based on objective, consistent criteria. \nMentor or sponsor talent of varying backgrounds (not just those who are similar to me).\nBe intentional about ensuring the people in my networks are culturally- and gender-diverse. \nGive my discretionary time to a variety of people at BSC, not just those who are high performers or with whom I feel comfortable. \n\u00a0\nUp groups or \u201cin groups\u201d in organizations\u2026\nTend to have access to power, control, and information \nTend to unconsciously rely on stereotypes \nTend to not think too much about their membership in an \u201cin group\u201d\nWhat are some \u201cin groups\u201d within Boston Scientific?\n \nDown groups or \u201cout groups\u201d in organizations\u2026\nHave less power, control, and information\nTend to experience extra scrutiny, stereotypes, and confirmation bias\nAre susceptible to \nstereotype threat\n, where anxiety about confirming negative stereotypes can precipitate self-doubt, and sometimes ends up hindering their ability to perform confidently and at their maximum level.\nTend to be very aware of being in an \u201cout group\u201d\nWhat are some \u201cout groups\u201d within Boston Scientific?\n\u00a0\nRemember\u2026 \u201cin groups\u201d can be \u201cout groups\u201d in different contexts. \n\u00a0\nIt\u2019s our job as people leaders to create a culture where all team members feel like they\u2019re part of your \u201cin group\u201d - heard, respected, understood, and like their contributions matter. Only then can exceptional performance be expected!\n\u00a0\nCoded language: \nWords or phrases that may appear neutral or harmless on the surface but carry underlying biases which can influence perceptions and opportunities in the workplace.\n\u00a0 \nExamples:\n\u201cHe lacks executive presence\u201d or \u201clacks polish\u201d\n\u201cShe\u2019s not a cultural fit here\u201d\n(To a Black colleague): \u201cWow, you\u2019re so articulate\u201d\n\u201cYou have an aggressive communication style\u201d\n\u201cHer hair style could have been more professional\u201d\n\u201cZara was a diversity hire\u201d\n\u00a0\nConcrete actions you can take to lead inclusively\nBuild Awareness, Listen Actively, Inclusive Environment\nEmpower Team, Value Contributions, Encourage Diverse Perspectives\nProvide Quality Feedback, Equity in Evaluations, Self-Awareness\n\u2022\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \nHave inclusive conversations by asking open-ended questions and listening deeply\n\u2022\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \nLearn about unconscious biases and their impact on decision-making.\n\u2022\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \nBuild cultural literacy on unfamiliar cultures; understand different work, communication, and conflict resolution styles.\n\u2022\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \nGive full attention and understanding before responding.\n\u2022\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \nAsk clarifying questions and confirm understanding.\n\u2022\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \nCreate a culture where team members feel safe expressing diverse opinions without fear of embarrassment.\n\u2022\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \nRotate the order of speakers in meetings to make sure everyone has a chance to contribute.\n\u00a0\n\u2022\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \nMake sure everyone has the resources needed for success.\n\u2022\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \nCreate conditions for team members to take risks and make their own decisions.\n\u2022\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \nProactively engage team members rather than waiting for them to speak up.\n\u2022\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \nThank and recognise team members in ways that are meaningful to them.\n\u2022\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \nPublicly highlight accomplishments, especially for those who are less vocal.\n\u2022\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \nActively seek out diverse viewpoints when making decisions or solving problems.\n\u2022\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \nEncourage ideas that challenge the status quo and demonstrate appreciation for novel suggestions.\n\u00a0\n\u2022\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \nOffer specific, actionable feedback that focuses on behaviour, not personal judgment.\n\u2022\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \nMake sure feedback is delivered in culturally competent ways.\n\u2022\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \nBuild trust by following through on feedback and advice received from others.\n\u2022\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \nReview hiring practices and ensure job descriptions are inclusive.\n\u2022\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \nRegularly review performance criteria to ensure they are fair and equitable for all backgrounds.\n\u2022\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \nResist judgment, recognizing that you may not fully see others' challenges.\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\nSample questions for inclusive conversations: \nWhat is a \u201cperfect\u201d day for you in your job?

How can we make sure we evaluate women\u2019s performance fairly? \nColorism (light skin preference)\n is the practice of favouring lighter skin over darker skin, particularly within the same ethnic group. People with fairer skin are seen as more beautiful and tend to receive better treatment by society and institutions. How can we avoid unconsciously giving people with lighter skin fewer development opportunities? \nClass/socioeconomic status\n: Are we unconsciously giving people from wealthier socioeconomic backgrounds more attention, more credibility, more development opportunities, more airtime? What could we do to proactively keep this in mind the next time we\u2019re making a people decision?\nCaste: \nCaste systems categorize people into hierarchical social groups and are based on a person\u2019s job/occupation and descent. While no longer legal, people\u2019s perceived caste still often influences how they are treated. What could we do to proactively keep this in mind the next time we\u2019re making a people decision?\n\u00a0\nTo lead inclusively at Boston Scientific, I will:\nExpand my circle of \u201cgo-to\u201d people. \nCreate opportunities for less talkative/extroverted people to demonstrate their capabilities.\nCheck against affinity bias or confirmation bias when I say a team member is not the \u201cright fit.\u201d\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \nIdentify high performers based on objective, consistent criteria. \nMentor or sponsor talent of varying backgrounds (not just those who are similar to me).\nBe intentional about ensuring the people in my networks are culturally- and gender-diverse. \nGive my discretionary time to a variety of people at BSC, not just those who are high performers or with whom I feel comfortable. \n\u00a0\nUp groups or \u201cin groups\u201d in organizations\u2026\nTend to have access to power, control, and information \nTend to unconsciously rely on stereotypes \nTend to not think too much about their membership in an \u201cin group\u201d\nWhat are some \u201cin groups\u201d within Boston Scientific?\n \nDown groups or \u201cout groups\u201d in organizations\u2026\nHave less power, control, and information\nTend to experience extra scrutiny, stereotypes, and confirmation bias\nAre susceptible to \nstereotype threat\n, where anxiety about confirming negative stereotypes can precipitate self-doubt, and sometimes ends up hindering their ability to perform confidently and at their maximum level.\nTend to be very aware of being in an \u201cout group\u201d\nWhat are some \u201cout groups\u201d within Boston Scientific?\n\u00a0\nRemember\u2026 \u201cin groups\u201d can be \u201cout groups\u201d in different contexts. \n\u00a0\nIt\u2019s our job as people leaders to create a culture where all team members feel like they\u2019re part of your \u201cin group\u201d - heard, respected, understood, and like their contributions matter.

Machines running 24/7 in absolute darkness. Robots handling everything from assembly to quality control. No humans so no lights needed. It sounds like science fiction, but in China, it\u2019s becoming reality.\nChina is leading the shift toward dark factories\n\u2014these manufacturing plants that operate with little to no human involvement.\nThe highly automated facilities use AI, robotics, and 5G to keep production running around the clock, boosting efficiency and cutting costs. The trend is growing fast in China, the global \u201cmanufacturing superpower\u201d which accounts for over 30% of global production.\nSome of the biggest names in Chinese manufacturing are already running dark factories, including Midea Group \u2013 the home appliance giant that produces \n30% of the world\u2019s air conditioners\n with almost no human involvement. \nAnother example is Changying Precision Technology Company, a factory in Dongguan, China, which \nreplaced 90% of its human workforce with robots\n, reducing the number of employees from 650 to 60 and in the process. The company experienced a 250% increase in production by using automated production lines with robotic arms, automated machining equipment, autonomous transport trucks, and other automated systems in the warehouse. \nWhile dark factories eliminate traditional factory jobs, a new kind of worker is emerging\u2014one that sits between office jobs and manual labor.\nInstead of line workers assembling products by hand, \nfactories now need technicians who keep robots running\n, workers who manage AI-driven supply chains, and specialists who fix smart machines before they break down. \nThese aren\u2019t the traditional \u201cblue-collar\u201d factory jobs of the past, but they aren\u2019t strictly \u201cwhite-collar\u201d either\u2014\nsome call them \u201cgray-collar\u201c professions.\n\u00a0 \nAI Titans Unite: UAE-Backed Project Attracts Tech Giants\nDubai Skyline\nI\nn a significant move, \nNvidia and Elon Musk\u2019s xAI have joined a consortium backed by \nAbu Dhabi\u2019s MGX\n\u2014a state-supported technology investment firm focused on AI and advanced technologies\n\u2014alongside Microsoft and BlackRock, the world\u2019s largest asset manager.\nThe $100 Billion Vision\nThe AI Infrastructure Partnership aims to mobilize up to $100 billion, including debt financing, to expand AI infrastructure, primarily in the US and OECD countries. This includes:\nBuilding state-of-the-art data centers\nDeveloping energy facilities to power AI applications\nSupporting cutting-edge AI technologies\nEnergy Considerations\nThe partnership recognizes the massive energy demands of AI infrastructure and plans to address them sustainably. \nBy 2034, data center energy consumption is projected to hit 1,580 terawatt-hours\u2014\nmatching India\u2019s current annual usage.\n\u00a0\n\ud83d\ude32\n\u00a0\nTo tackle this, NextEra Energy and GE Vernova are collaborating on diverse, scalable energy solutions for AI data centers.\nGlobal Competition\nThis follows US President Donald Trump\u2019s January 2025 announcement of Stargate, a $500 billion private-sector AI infrastructure push backed by SoftBank Group, OpenAI, and Oracle. \nThis alliance, now strengthened by Nvidia and xAI, highlights the escalating global race for AI supremacy. \nAnd the United Arab Emirates (UAE)\u2019s influence is undeniable\u2014MGX\u2019s backing, potentially linked to sovereign wealth giants like Mubadala, anchors the partnership firmly in the Middle East.\n\u00a0 \nWho\u2019s Up For Some \u201cVibe Coding\u201d?\nWhat's your plan this weekend? How about doing some \"vibe coding\"?\nIt's the latest trend buzzing in Silicon Valley\n, and here\u2019s what it\u2019s all about:\nThe term \"vibe coding\" was coined by Andrej Karpathy, renowned computer scientist and OpenAI co-founder. \nLast month, he described this new approach where developers \"fully give in to the vibes\" and \"forget the code even exists.\" \nInstead of manually typing, \nthey rely on AI-assisted coding \nthrough natural language prompts, letting AI generate the code for them.\nKarpathy sometimes doesn\u2019t even type the English prompts \u2014he uses SuperWhisper to dictate commands to the Cursor coding assistant.\nThe result? Code gets written. Apps get built. And instead of spending hours debugging or waiting for your tech engineers, you get to be creative and prototype ideas. According to Y Combinator, most startups coming through their incubator are now generating 90% of their code with AI tools like ChatGPT.\nStill, some might say that it\u2019s better to write your own code than spend hours debugging what AI gives them. What do you think?\nWould you let AI code for you?\nYes! AI writes the code and I get the credit\u2014why not? \ud83d\ude0e \nMaybe\u2026 but if the code crashes, I\u2019m blaming the vibes. \ud83e\udd28 \nNo way! We're real devs, we debug our own disasters. \ud83d\udd25 \n\u00a0 \nLATELY\nArticles I\u2019ve Been Reading:\nSpotify is expanding its AI-narrated audiobook collection through \na new partnership with ElevenLabs\n, allowing authors to create audiobooks in 29 languages and upload them through Spotify\u2019s distribution service, Findaway Voices. AI-generated titles are labeled after a review process. \nThis makes audiobook production far cheaper. ElevenLabs offers a free tier for short recordings, while its $99/month Pro plan generates up to 500 minutes of narration\u2014\nfar less than the thousands of dollars a human narrator typically charges\n. \nFor professional voice actors, this shift means finding new ways to stay relevant. Some are already exploring licensing deals, where their voices are used to train AI models, allowing them to earn royalties rather than being replaced outright.

For Chase Gallagher (pictured above), it meant building a $1.5 million landscaping business\u2026 before he could even drive.\nThere is a growing wave of Gen Z entrepreneurs \u2014 born between 1997 and 2012 \u2014 who aren\u2019t waiting for a diploma to start making money. \nTake Cal AI, for example, which I just downloaded a few days ago to track my calories. Snap a picture of your meal, and the app instantly estimates calories and macros. \nIt\u2019s pulled in 5M+ downloads and $2M in revenue last month, but here\u2019s the thing: it wasn\u2019t built by a big tech firm. It was created by two 18-year-olds. \n\ud83d\ude0e \nA Fortune article by Orianna Rosa Royle highlights \nhow Gen Z is skipping the traditional career path\n, turning side gigs into six-figure businesses while their peers are still in school.\nHere\u2019s the story:\nGen Z isn\u2019t buying into the corporate dream. \nThey\u2019ve seen their parents struggle with layoffs, burnout, and jobs that barely keep up with the cost of living. Stability in a traditional 9-to-5 is no longer a guarantee, so they\u2019re looking for another way.\nTech has made entrepreneurship more accessible than ever. \nWith nothing more than a phone and an internet connection, young people are launching Etsy shops, reselling sneakers, trading stocks, or building entire brands on TikTok. Now with AI writing the code for them too, the barriers to entry are even lower, and the potential for success is massive.\nThe numbers back it up. \nOn LinkedIn, \u201cfounder\u201d is the second-fastest-growing job title among Gen Z. Nearly 2 out of 3 say they already have a side gig or plan to start one soon.\nWhy it matters\n: Big companies can\u2019t afford to ignore this shift. Gen Z isn\u2019t waiting around for their next promotion\u2014with more and more Gen Zs turning \u201cfounders,\u201c traditional employers risk losing an entire generation to independent ventures and freelancing.\nTo attract young talent in the modern age, businesses need to rethink what they offer. Competitive salaries aren\u2019t enough; Gen Z values \nflexibility, autonomy, and purpose-driven work\n. \nI often hear people say Gen Z is lazy and doesn\u2019t want to work, but I don\u2019t see it that way. They\u2019re willing to work hard, as long as they\u2019re given the flexibility to do it on their own terms. \n\ud83e\udd17 \n\u00a0 \nInsilico Medicine Secures $110M to Speed Up AI Drug Discovery\nInsilico CSO Feng Ren (L) and founder Alex Zhavoronkov (R). Image: Insilico Medicine\nBiotech company Insilico Medicine is using AI to rethink drug discovery. Now, \nwith a fresh $110 million in funding pushing its valuation past $1 billion\n, the startup is considering a Hong Kong IPO.\nDeveloping a new drug is notoriously slow and expensive\u2014it can take over a decade and billions of dollars before a single treatment reaches patients. Insilico wants to change that with AI, making the process faster, cheaper, and more precise. \nAt the core of Insilico\u2019s approach is Pharma.AI\n, which analyzes vast biological datasets and predict which molecules are most likely to work, reducing the need for excessive trial and error. \nInsilico is already delivering results\n\u2014its leading drug candidate, Rentosertib, for a serious lung disease, reached early clinical trials in just 2.5 years, a process that normally takes up to six.\nThe company is making big deals\n by licensing its AI-generated drugs to pharmaceutical giants like Sanofi and Fosun Pharma, securing $3.5 billion in contract value.\nThe startup\u2019s pipeline now includes 30 drug candidates, with 10 receiving clearance from the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) to proceed with human trials.\nBeyond discovery, \nInsilico is using AI to speed up lab work\n. The company is testing humanoid robots in its China lab to automate repetitive tasks, collect data, and reduce human error, all in an attempt to speed up research.\nIf Insilico succeeds, it could reshape the entire drug discovery process. By combining AI, real drug candidates, and even lab robots, the company is tackling the whole process, not just one piece of it. Faster, cheaper, and maybe even better\u2014this could be a glimpse of how future drugs come to life.\n\u00a0 \nWho\u2019s The Better Manager: Moms or MBAs?\nThink about the best manager you've ever had. Were they great because of what they learned in business school\u2014or because they understood people, priorities, and how to keep everything running smoothly under pressure?\nAccording to Indian billionaire and founder Manoj Bhargava, \nthe toughest management challenges don\u2019t come with just a corporate title\n. They happen in everyday life, where the stakes are much more real and daunting.\nIn line with that logic, Bhargava believes that the best place to learn management isn\u2019t a classroom\u2026 it\u2019s your mom.\nBhargava explained that moms juggle budgets, resolve conflicts, and manage \u201cemployees\u201d they can\u2019t fire (aka their kids). While MBAs focus on strategy and theory, moms make tough decisions in real time, with real consequences. \nIt\u2019s a compelling argument. But does experience alone build great leaders, or do MBAs still offer something essential? What do you think?\nWho's the better manager: Moms or MBAs?\nMoms! \ud83d\udc69\ud83c\udffc\u200d\ud83e\uddb0They\u2019ve been running a high-stakes startup since day one. \nWhy not both! \ud83d\ude0e A CEO mindset with a mom\u2019s efficiency is unstoppable. \nMBAs! \ud83d\udc69\ud83c\udffc\u200d\ud83c\udf93Boardrooms and bedtime battles aren\u2019t the same. \n\u00a0 \nLATELY\nArticles I\u2019ve Been Reading:\nLex Fridman, known for his highly popular long-form podcast featuring guests like Elon Musk and Noam Chomsky, recently interviewed Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi. Fridman\u2019s discussions attract a wide audience, and \nModi\u2019s episode has already reached 2M views in two days\n. \nModi spoke on AI saying that while AI is powerful, he firmly believed that \"no technology can ever replace the boundless creativity and imagination of the human mind\u201d. He also emphasized that India\u2019s AI talent will remain crucial to the world as it modernizes in this new era. \n\u00a0 \nHonored to be \nfeatured by ELLE Magazine\n as a leading woman on International Women\u2019s Day. \nHere\u2019s to all the women who inspire, lead, and pave the way for the next generation. \nUntil next time! \nAyesha \u2764\ufe0f \nps.

The URLs have changed across all languages, and they would like the updated URLs placed and have SCORM files re-generated.\n\u00a0\nMay I request the associated cost and timing of this request please? I\u2019m crossing my fingers it won\u2019t be too onerous, but do let me know the expected cost, with a rush order applied if possible.\n\u00a0\nThanks in advance,\n\u00a0\nDon\n\u00a0\n_________________________\nDiligent\nDon Reyes,\n\u00a0he/him\nDirector, Advisory and Consulting Services\nSuite 1500, 980 Howe Street, Vancouver, BC, Canada, V6Z 0C8\nOffice Line: 202-227-2155| \ndreyes@diligent.com\n\u00a0| \ndiligent.com",

In December, the Ministry of Education selected 184 schools nationwide to pilot AI programs, signaling a commitment to expanding these initiatives. \nHuai Jinpeng, China's Minister of Education, emphasized AI's significance, referring to it as the \"golden key\" to the future of the country's education system.\nGlobal Implications\nChina's move raises questions about whether other countries are doing enough to keep pace in AI education. Similar initiatives are being explored globally, with US states like California and countries Italy also integrating AI into their educational systems\n.\n\u00a0 \nWOMAN IN TECH\nMeet Minna Song, Founder of EliseAI\nCelebrating this week's Woman in Tech \n\ud83e\udd73\n: \nMeet Minna Song, founder of EliseAI\n, the AI-powered real estate platform that reached unicorn status in 2024.\nMinna holds a BS in Computer Science from MIT. After working as an administrative assistant at a real estate firm, she noticed how inefficient rental communication could be\u2014slow responses, missed calls, and endless back-and-forth emails.\nIn 2017, Song founded EliseAI, which acts as a virtual assistant for property managers, handling leasing, maintenance, and tenant communication.\nInstant responses\n \u2013 It provides instant, human-like responses across email, SMS, phone calls, and chat, ensuring renters get timely and accurate information.\nSmarter automation \n\u2013 The AI takes care of repetitive tasks like answering FAQs, processing applications, and scheduling appointments.\nCustomizable interactions \n\u2013 Businesses can tailor EliseAI\u2019s responses to match their brand\u2019s tone and communication style.\nBy taking over these routine conversations, EliseAI frees up property managers to focus on more complex tasks\u2014leading to faster service and a smoother experience for renters. Today, \nEliseAI is used by 70% of the top 50 multifamily property owners in the US and supports 1 in 12 multifamily units.\nIn 2024, EliseAI secured a Series D funding of $75M, with the company now valued at more than $1B.\nI love how Minna saw beyond the frustration in real estate communication and turned it into an opportunity to drive real change for renters and property managers. \n\ud83d\ude0e \n\u00a0 \nAI Quiz: How Well Do You Know AI in Business?\nAI is already shaping industries, but do you know which applications have been successfully used in business for years?

The system aims to address the shortage of human actors traditionally used for training. \nSpain imposes heavy fines for\n unlabeled AI-generated content\n \u2013 Companies face up to $38M in penalties under a new bill enforcing strict transparency on AI-generated media. The law aligns with the EU AI Act to combat misinformation and deepfakes. \nUK\u2019s Prime Minister Starmer to propose\n AI replace some of the work of civil servants\n \u2013 Starmer plans to push for AI adoption in public services, arguing it can handle tasks faster and more efficiently. His \"digital revolution\" aims to cut costs and streamline bureaucracy. \nIndia\u2019s Apollo Hospitals \ninvests in AI\n -\n\u00a0\nIt will use AI to reduce the workload of its doctors and nurses by up to 3 hours daily, \nby using AI to assist with patient diagnoses, tests, treatment suggestions, and transcription of doctors' notes, as well as creating discharge summaries and daily schedules.\n\u00a0 \nHere\u2019s Your Answer: \nB) AI-powered recruitment tools screening resumes. \nAI has been used for years to analyze resumes, filter job applicants, and even conduct initial interview assessments. \nHireVue\n, for example, uses AI-driven video interviews and assessments to screen candidates based on facial expressions, tone of voice, and language.\nUntil next time! \nAyesha \u2764\ufe0f \nps.

You just want to get clarification if they want LCW to do the videos, so that you bake that time into the quote.\n\u00a0\nIn order to develop\u00a0an English Code of Conduct for Diligent, we've found it can estimate between 10hrs-15hrs depending on their customization template, included in the files shared with us. It looks average length, but since they are going with a new design template, it remains at 12hrs for myself to build. If you look at the Languages section of the Work Order, this is where I quote implementing each translation into a module. It averages 1-2hrs per language, with some right-to-left languages requiring more adjustments and sometimes being 3hrs.\u00a0\n\u00a0\nYou can use the numbers I sent for a quote but they won't need too much additional information other than turnaround time.

Looking at the work order I see there are remarks made regarding edits to video work from Diligent's\u00a0own library. See below. This is where you would ask them if you are wanting LCW to do the video editing customizations outlined here. If so, I can provide a quote. You just want to get clarification if they want LCW to do the videos, so that you bake that time into the quote.\nIn order to develop\u00a0an English Code of Conduct for Diligent, we've found it can estimate between 10hrs-15hrs depending on their customization template, included in the files shared with us. It looks average length, but since they are going with a new design template, it remains at 12hrs for myself to build. If you look at the Languages section of the Work Order, this is where I quote implementing each translation into a module. It averages 1-2hrs per language, with some right-to-left languages requiring more adjustments and sometimes being 3hrs.\u00a0\nYou can use the numbers I sent for a quote but they won't need too much additional information other than turnaround time. I see that the client was frustrated so I offered the two turnaround times if it helps. They are\u00a0familiar with the overall work process, but I'm more than happy to help mitigate some of those emails or hop on a call to talk workflow if it helps.\nLet me know if you are looking for something different or need more responses for the client conversation.\nBest,\nDustin\nOn Thu, Mar 13, 2025 at 10:08\u202fAM Jorgelina Venturi <\nj.venturi@lcwmail.com\n> wrote:\n\ufeff\nT\nhank you so much!\n\u00a0\nJorgelina (Lina) Venturi\nTranslation Specialist\nLCW\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\nFrom: \nElixir Multimedia Solutions <\nelixirmultimediasolutions@gmail.com\n>\nDate: \nThursday, 13 March 2025 at 12:02\n\u202f\nPM\nTo: \nJorgelina Venturi <\nj.venturi@lcwmail.com\n>\nCc: \nNicole Barile <\nn.barile@lcwmail.com\n>, Cecilia Mariotta <\nc.mariotta@lcwmail.com\n>, Keri Luo <\nk.luo@lcwmail.com\n>\nSubject: \nRe: Diligent/LCW - CoC Quote Request - GXO URGENT\nOf course.

You can choose different voices and record voiceovers within the program.\n\u00a0\nI don\u2019t know.\n\u00a0\nI\u2019m not sure if we have any templates.

When the very architects of modern AI express such concern, it's clear that companies like OpenAI, Google, and Microsoft \nneed to recalibrate their approach\n - balancing technological advancement with robust risk assessment and responsible deployment.\n\u00a0 \nBig Mac, Big Data: McDonald\u2019s Is Cooking With AI\nIce cream machine broken? Not anymore. \nMcDonald\u2019s is \nbetting on AI to improve order accuracy, streamline kitchen operations, and even predict when broken ice cream machines before they break\n.\nHere\u2019s what\u2019s happening:\nFew things frustrate McDonald\u2019s customers more than a broken ice cream machine\u2014or any other equipment failure that slows down service. Now, McDonald\u2019s is putting tiny\n sensors on kitchen equipment to spot problems before they cause breakdowns.\nThese sensors will send real-time data to an AI system, which will calculate if something is about to go wrong with the equipment. That means fryers, grills, and yes, even the ice cream machines, could be fixed before they actually break\u2014saving time, money, and a lot of disappointed customers.\nMcDonald\u2019s is also testing AI-powered cameras to verify orders before they reach customers, reducing mistakes and making sure you actually get the fries you paid for.\nWhy it matters: \nMcDonald\u2019s move follows a trend in fast food, with chains like Pizza Hut and Taco Bell also testing AI-driven operational tools. This is a win-win for both sides: customers receive quicker, more reliable service, while restaurant managers are freed from routine operational issues. \nWith over 43,000 locations worldwide and a $200+ billion valuation, even small efficiency improvements at McDonald's can generate millions in savings, reduce waste, and speed up service across thousands of restaurants. And lead to some very happy customers.\nThe company is betting on it. \nMcDonald's aims to grow its loyalty base from 175 million to 250 million by 2027, leveraging its vast customer data and proactive approach to innovation. \n's aims to grow its loyalty base from 175 million to 250 million by 2027, leveraging its vast customer data and proactive approach to innovation. \ud83d\ude0e \n\u00a0 \nAI Just Sold $100M Worth of Homes\nHouses in beautiful Lisbon, Portugal\nHouse hunting can be exhausting.

The weather is finally a bit warmer!\n\u00a0\nI wanted to touch base again on my previous question about building a new Microlearning....but this time more around e-Learnings.\n\u00a0\nSome questions for you:\n1.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \nWhat is your comfort level building an EL or ML from scratch? \nWhen I say \"from scratch,\" I mean that we don't have any content for it yet, so you'd have to work closely with an LCW SME to create.\n2.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \nHow would you feel about taking existing LCW facilitated content & making it into an EL?\n\u00a0For example, using our \"Women in Leadership Spotlight\" PPT deck as a guide to build an EL.\na.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \nI'd love to learn if this is something you're interested in, how long you think it might take to do this, and how you would charge - we could do hourly, or we could perhaps come up with a set price per project. For example, we pay you $X amount to turn a facilitated training into an EL.\nWe probably should get on a call to discuss, but I wanted to send this to you first so you could think on it. \n\ud83d\ude42\n\u00a0If you're interested in doing either above, LMK, and I'll schedule a time to chat.\n\u00a0\nThank you!\nNicole\n\u00a0\nNicole Barile\n\u00a0\n(She/Her)\nChief Operating Officer\nLCW\n\u00a0\nWebsite\n\u00a0\n|\n\u00a0\nTwitter\n\u00a0\n|\n\u00a0\nFacebook\n\u00a0\n|\n\u00a0\nLinkedIn\nView our upcoming events\n\u00a0| \nSign-up for our newsletter\n\u00a0\nFrom:\n\u00a0Keri Luo <\nk.luo@lcwmail.com\n>\nSent:\n\u00a0Thursday, February 13, 2025 2:35 PM\nTo:\n\u00a0Nicole Barile <\nn.barile@lcwmail.com\n>\nSubject:\n\u00a0RE: Questions about new ML build\n\u00a0\nI would estimate that developing a five-lesson course would take around 30-40 hours.\n\u00a0\n~Keri\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\nFrom:\n\u00a0Nicole Barile <\nn.barile@lcwmail.com\n>\nSent:\n\u00a0Thursday, February 13, 2025 12:47 PM\nTo:\n\u00a0Keri Luo <\nk.luo@lcwmail.com\n>\nSubject:\n\u00a0Re: Questions about new ML build\n\u00a0\nOK awesome, thanks for the quick reply.

It typically takes about 5 to 8 days to build.\nIf it\u2019s a microlearning, I will use Rise. (The storyline is for larger courses.)\nSame as #1.\nYes, both Rise and Storyline support translation into other languages (by exporting the course content as an XLIFF file, which can then be translated by translators and imported back into Rise to create a multilingual version of the course.) \u00a0\nYes, I can easily do that.\n\u00a0\nI hope that helps. Feel free to call me if you want to know more details.\n\u00a0\nBest,\n~Keri\n\u00a0\nFrom:\n\u00a0Nicole Barile <\nn.barile@lcwmail.com\n>\nSent:\n\u00a0Thursday, February 13, 2025 11:40 AM\nTo:\n\u00a0Keri Luo <\nk.luo@lcwmail.com\n>\nSubject:\n\u00a0Questions about new ML build\n\u00a0\nHello Keri,\n\u00a0\nI hope you're having a great week!\n\u00a0\nWe may have a client who wants a new microlearning build, and I have several questions:\nHow long does it take you, on average, to turn an existing LCW training (from PPT) into an elearning or microloearning?\nI think you're doing something for Andrea for Rockwell...\nDo you typically use Rise or Storyline for LCW?\nHow long would it take you, on average, to create a new microlearning from scratch (assuming the course is around 30 minutes or less)?\nThis is assuming someone from LCW would work with you on the content, as a subject matter expert\nDoes Rise and/or Storyline allow for translation into other languages?\nIf Yes, is this something you can do? (We would have professional translators review for accuracy / QA)\nIf No, do you know of a workaround (ex: translating outside of Rise/Storyline & then importing the translation)\nPlease let me know if you have\u00a0any questions.\nHappy to also hop on a call if easier to talk through.\nThanks so much!\nNicole\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\nNicole Barile\n\u00a0\n(She/Her)\nChief Operating Officer\nLCW\n\u00a0\nWebsite\n\u00a0\n|\n\u00a0\nTwitter\n\u00a0\n|\n\u00a0\nFacebook\n\u00a0\n|\n\u00a0\nLinkedIn\nView our upcoming events\n\u00a0| \nSign-up for our newsletter",

The company just raised $18.3M to help its team of biologists, chemists, and software engineers develop enzymes to break down synthetic fabrics like polyester and nylon far quicker than anything in nature.\nHere\u2019s their story:\nScientists have long known that some enzymes can digest plastic\u2014but they work too slowly to be practical.\nEpoch\u2019s team trained AI to accelerate nature\u2019s process, designing enzymes that break down plastic \n25 times faster\n.\nInstead of waiting millions of years for evolution to refine these enzymes, AI can test thousands of variations in a fraction of the time, unlocking solutions that wouldn\u2019t have been possible before.\nWhy it matters\n: Plastic recycling has always been a challenge\u2014it's expensive, inefficient, and energy-intensive. Epoch\u2019s approach changes that by using enzymes (instead of heat and chemicals) to break down plastic at a lower cost and with less environmental impact.\nOne of the biggest culprits is the fashion industry, with most clothing today made from synthetic fabrics.\nThat\u2019s why Inditex (the company behind Zara) has signed a multi-year deal with Epoch, \nhoping to turn old clothes into new ones\n. If Epoch can scale this tech, it could change how we handle plastic waste. Instead of sitting in landfills for centuries, plastic could be continuously broken down and reused.\nFun fact\n: Epoch Biodesign began as a high school science project by founder Jacob Nathan. \n\ud83d\ude01\ud83d\ude01 \n\u00a0 \nThe New Sesame Voice Assistant Is Really Uncanny\nThe AI world has been abuzz with the introduction of Sesame's Conversational Speech Model, a voice assistant that has left many users both amazed and unsettled.\nSesame AI\u2019s voice assistant feels strangely human\u2014it pauses, hesitates, interrupts, and even changes its mind mid-sentence, mimicking the natural quirks of human speech. At times, \nit feels so natural that you almost forget you\u2019re talking to AI\n.\nThat\u2019s what makes it so unsettling. We expect to be able to distinguish AI voices from real people, but Sesame pushes past that with effortless and fluid conversations. You can interrupt, switch topics, or change your mind, and it keeps up without missing a beat.\nIt can even adjust its tone based on mood, responding with encouragement, humor, or subtle pauses that make it seem like it\u2019s really \nlistening\n.\nThis is where AI enters what is known as the \n\u201cuncanny valley\u201d\n: that space where technology feels almost human\u2026 but not quite. We\u2019ve gotten used to AI sounding artificial, but when it starts mimicking human speech this naturally, it\u2019s really eerie. \n\ud83d\ude2c \nThe company behind this innovation, Sesame AI, has already raised $10 million to push its conversational tech even further.\nThe Ethical Implications: \nWhile Sesame's breakthrough tech dazzles, it carries a dark shadow\u2014imagine scammers wielding voices indistinguishable from your loved ones. How will we know who's really on the line? \nYou have to try it to understand what I mean. It\u2019s free to use. Check it out \nhere\n: \nps. I had a quirky little conversation about weekend worthy movies and vegan recipes with \u201cMiles\u201d. \n\u00a0 \nLATELY\nArticles I\u2019ve Been Reading:\nA cancer diagnosis is devastating\u2014but for many patients, the treatment can be just as grueling. Chemotherapy often comes with brutal side effects: fatigue, nausea, and long-term health risks. But what if \nAI could help doctors determine whether chemo is even necessary\n? \nAtaraxis AI, a New York-based startup, is working on predicting long-term cancer outcomes, helping oncologists decide if chemotherapy is really even needed. \nHow it works\n: Ataraxis\u2019 AI models analyze images of cancer cells, learning from hundreds of millions of real patient cases. The system looks for subtle patterns that indicate whether a tumor is likely to return or spread in the next 5 to 10 years. If the model finds that the risk is low, patients may be able to skip chemo\u2014avoiding its physical and financial toll. \nNow, with $20.4M in Series A funding, the startup is launching its first commercial test for breast cancer in the US. It\u2019s also backed by Meta\u2019s chief AI scientist, Yann LeCun, who is advising on its AI advancements. \n\u00a0 \nThe Pentagon just signed a deal with \nScale AI to use artificial intelligence for military strategy and operations \nunder \na new program called \"Thunderforge.\"\n Their goal is to help commanders process vast amounts of data, predict threats, and make faster decisions in real-time. \nAI will analyze battlefield scenarios, generate strategies, and even run war simulations to anticipate possible outcomes. \nBut the use of AI in warfare raises serious concerns. A Stanford study found that GPT-4, when tested in a military simulation, displayed aggressive behavior\u2014including suggesting nuclear strikes. While this doesn\u2019t mean AI will control real-world weapons anytime soon, it highlights the risks of relying on AI for high-stakes decision-making. \n\u00a0 \nHonored to be featured in Grazia's Game Changers of 2025. \ud83e\udd73 \nAI wasn\u2019t always an easy sell. In the early days, skepticism was the norm and \u201cno\u201d was the most common response. But every rejection was an opportunity to refine the vision, build stronger use cases, and prove that AI could create real impact. \nOver time, my definition of success has also evolved. It\u2019s no longer just about advancing AI, but ensuring it is responsible, inclusive, and accessible. A key part of that is bringing more women into the field, because the future of AI should be shaped by diverse voices. \nHuge shoutout to all the incredible women featured \ud83c\udf89 \nRead the full interview \nhere.\nUntil next time! \nAyesha \u2764\ufe0f \nps.

Singapore Cracks Down on\u00a0Illegal\u00a0Trade\nWould You Trust AI with Your Doctor\u2019s Notes?\nArticles I\u2019ve Been Reading\n\u00a0 \nNEWS YOU CAN\u2019T MISS\nChatGPT Might Need Therapy Too, Scientists Say\nAI models like ChatGPT process massive amounts of human-generated text\u2026including distressing news, traumatic stories, and emotionally charged discussions.\nNow, researchers from the University of Zurich suggest that \nAI itself can experience \"anxiety\"\u2014and it may even benefit from therapy\n.\nHere\u2019s what they found:\nTrauma triggers bias:\n ChatGPT reacted strongly to negative content like military experiences, car accidents, and interpersonal violence. These prompts doubled its \u201canxiety\u201d levels, making it more likely to reflect stereotypes and negative social patterns, just as humans under stress might react with fear or bias.\nTherapeutic prompts work:\n Researchers tested mindfulness-based relaxation techniques (essentially \u201ctherapy\u201d for AI) by injecting calming statements into its chat history.\nIt worked\u2014but not completely:\n The AI's anxiety decreased significantly, though it didn\u2019t fully return to baseline. Techniques included breathing exercises, body awareness prompts, and even AI-generated relaxation exercises.\nWhy it matters\n: Therapy chatbots are constantly exposed to emotional distress, which could impact their reliability. Instead of costly retraining, \nprompt-based interventions\n could help stabilize AI\u2019s emotional responses in sensitive contexts.\nSo does AI feel emotions? \nNo, but it absorbs patterns from human language\u2014including how we express anxiety. When people read bad news, they react with fear or distress. AI, trained on millions of human conversations, picks up on this pattern and mimics it in its responses.\nThat\u2019s why, when fed negative content, it starts behaving in a more biased or anxious way, just like humans do.\nThe next time ChatGPT\u2019s responses feel a little off? Maybe just ask it to take a deep breath. \ud83e\uddd8\u200d\u2642\ufe0f\n\u00a0 \nWho\u2019s Smuggling AI Chips? Singapore Cracks Down on\u00a0Illegal\u00a0Trade\nMerlion Park, Singapore\nSingapore is currently conducting a \nmajor investigation into suspected illegal shipments \nof servers containing restricted Nvidia AI chips, highlighting how AI technology has become a critical geopolitical battleground.\nHere\u2019s what\u2019s unfolding:\nSingapore police are investigating Dell and Super Micro servers containing restricted Nvidia AI chips. While legally sold to distributors in Singapore, US rules prohibit their re-export to countries like China.\nThree men were arrested for allegedly misrepresented the servers' intended use and destination, bypassing export restrictions and potentially allowing the chips to reach prohibited end users, including Chinese entities. \nIf convicted, the individuals could face up to 20 years in prison, reflecting Singapore's strict enforcement of trade regulations.\nWhy it matters\n: AI chips have become a flashpoint in US-China tensions, with governments treating them as \nstrategic assets\n rather than just advanced hardware. The fact that people are now being arrested over their movement shows how tightly these exports are being controlled\u2014and how serious the stakes have become.\nAdvanced chips fuel everything from military tech to economic growth, and the ability to access or withhold them is now \na geopolitical tool\n. As AI becomes more powerful, expect these restrictions to become even tighter.\n\u00a0 \nWould You Trust AI with Your Doctor\u2019s Notes?\nDoctors spend nearly 28 hours a week buried in paperwork\u2014typing clinical notes, drafting referrals, and filling out post-visit summaries. \nMicrosoft\u2019s new Dragon Copilot wants to change that.\nThe new AI tool can listen in during consultations, transcribe conversations, and automatically generate documentation in real time. It can even answer medical queries such as \u201cShould this patient be screened for lung cancer?\u201c. The goal is to reduce admin work for doctors, helping them pay more attention to patients. \nDragon Copilot is accessible through a mobile app, browser or desktop, and can integrate with several different electronic health records. \nI love the idea of doctors focusing more on patients than on paperwork \n\ud83d\ude0a\n but should AI be handling something as sensitive as medical notes? What do you think?\nDo you feel comfortable with AI listening in on your convo with the doctor?\nYes, more attention for me that way! \ud83d\ude0a \nMaybe, but what are they doing to keep this data secure? \ud83e\udd14 \nNo thanks! My health talks are between me and my doctor. \ud83d\udeab \n\u00a0 \nLATELY\nArticles I\u2019ve Been Reading:\nWayve, a UK-based autonomous driving startup, \nis expanding globally after securing $1B \nfrom SoftBank, Microsoft, and Nvidia. \nThe company has begun testing its self-driving technology in Germany and the US, with plans to enter Japan. Unlike Waymo\u2019s sensor-heavy robotaxis, Wayve uses a single AI model that learns from real-world driving rather than relying on pre-mapped 3D environments. This allows it to adapt to new cities with minimal setup. \nWayve has opened offices in Stuttgart and Silicon Valley to work closely with automakers and regulators. CEO Alex Kendall says Wayve is in discussions to integrate its software into production vehicles through software updates, reducing the need for expensive new hardware. As regulatory approvals progress, Wayve is positioning itself alongside Tesla, Waymo, and Chinese EV makers in the race to scale AI-driven mobility. \nPs. I wouldn\u2019t be too quick to toss out my driver\u2019s license just yet. Wayve\u2019s AI might be learning fast, but getting regulators and automakers fully on board could take some time. \n\u00a0 \nI\u2019m super excited to launch the first episode of our podcast Augment with my co-host Bernard Leong, powered by \nSingapore\u2019s Economic Development Board (EDB)\n. \n\ud83e\udd73 \nAugment covers the most interesting movers and shakers in AI across the globe \n\u2013\n no jargon, no hype, just engaging insights that help you stay ahead.\nFor our first conversation, we're joined by \nrenowned tech analyst Benedict Evans\n, who brings over 20 years of expertise across mobile, media, and technology sectors. Most recently a partner at the pioneering Silicon Valley venture capital firm Andreessen Horowitz, Evans has established himself as a leading voice in analyzing how technology reshapes industries and markets worldwide.\nWe'll explore how AI is eating the world \u2013 examining what's changing, what's overhyped, and where the real shifts are happening.\nWatch the episode \nhere\n. \nUntil next time! \nAyesha \u2764\ufe0f \nps.

Get a Humanities Degree\nDoes Working in Office Boost Productivity?\nArticles I\u2019ve Been Reading\n\u00a0 \nNEWS YOU CAN\u2019T MISS\nIs That a Robot Bringing Your\u00a0Tacos?\nImage: Serve Robotics\nYour next Uber Eats order \nmight arrive in this small self-driving robot\n hastily navigating its way down the sidewalk.\nThe robot is part of a project by Serve Robotics, a company spun off from Uber. It is now bringing its autonomous delivery bots to Brickell and Miami Beach, where they\u2019ll navigate busy sidewalks, dodge obstacles, and deliver food\u2014no humans needed.\nHere\u2019s the rundown:\nMore robots, more cities\n: Serve Robotics has already completed tens of thousands of deliveries and has a deal in place to deploy up to 2,000 robots across the US via Uber Eats.\nWhy Miami?\n The city\u2019s mix of high foot traffic and restaurant density makes it an ideal testing ground for contactless, automated food delivery.\nFueling rapid growth\n: Serve raised $86M in December, bringing total funding to $220M. The company is expanding beyond Los Angeles, with Miami now live and Dallas-Fort Worth next in line.\nRestaurants are adapting\n: Shake Shack and Mister O1 are among the growing number of restaurant chains integrating robotic delivery into their operations, aiming to streamline service and reduce costs.\nWhy it matters\n: Autonomous delivery has long been hyped, but its success depends on how well it works in the real world. Miami\u2019s dense, pedestrian-heavy streets will be an effective litmus test for whether robots can actually navigate urban environments efficiently.\nIf robotic couriers can prove themselves in tough spaces like these? They could change the food delivery game for both restaurants and customers. \nWhile it may reduce some courier roles, the tech will create new jobs in AI logistics, fleet operations, and robot maintenance. The focus will shift from making deliveries to managing and optimizing the technology.\nAnd why not? I\u2019d love to have my pizza delivered by this adorable robot. \n\ud83d\ude04 \n\u00a0 \nWant A Job in AI? Get a Humanities Degree\nFor years, a tech degree was the typical path into tech. But in the age of AI, that\u2019s starting to change.\nAccording to Steven Johnson, editorial director at Google Labs\u2019 NotebookLM, \nAI is creating demand for skills traditionally associated with philosophy, psychology, and the liberal arts\n. Fine-tuning AI models isn\u2019t just about coding\u2014it\u2019s about shaping their tone, ethics, and interactions in ways that feel natural and human.\nHere\u2019s what\u2019s changing:\nAI needs \u2018character training\u2019:\n AI models aren\u2019t just about coding\u2014they need personality, ethical reasoning, and nuance. At Anthropic, philosopher Amanda Askell works on fine-tuning AI behavior, wrestling with questions like: Should AI models have moral considerations? What human principles should they follow?\nThe rise of the \u2018AI wrangler\u2019: \nJohnson describes a new role emerging beyond prompt engineering: the AI wrangler. These professionals don\u2019t need to code, but they deeply understand AI models, their strengths, and how to get the best results.\nFluency in AI models is the new must-have skill:\n AI is evolving fast, and knowing how to leverage different models for different tasks is becoming a critical skill across industries, from marketing to journalism to research.\nWhile roles like \"AI wrangler\" highlight the need for human insight in shaping AI behavior, does it actually mean more influence for non-techies?\nRight now, AI models are still largely controlled by engineers and researchers who build and fine-tune them at the core. Bringing in philosophers and linguists to adjust tone and ethical reasoning is valuable, but it\u2019s often happening \nafter the fact\n\u2014when models are already built. The real power in AI lies not just in tweaking its personality but in deciding how it\u2019s developed from the ground up.\nFor humanities professionals to have a lasting impact, they may need to do more than fine-tune AI\u2014they may need to push for a seat at the table in shaping AI\u2019s foundations, governance, and ethical guardrails. Otherwise, their role might remain as polishers of the final product rather than architects of its core logic.\n\u00a0 \nDoes Working in Office Boost Productivity?\nSergey Brin \nwants Google employees back in the office, \non every weekday\n.\nIn a recent memo, the Google co-founder called in-person work essential for staying ahead in AI and suggested that 60-hour workweeks hit the \"sweet spot\" for productivity.\nThis isn\u2019t an official policy change, since Google still requires only 3 in-office days per week. But Brin\u2019s stance mirrors moves from other big names: Amazon recently mandated a full return, along with JPMorgan Chase and the US\u2019 Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE). Others like Spotify remain committed to remote work, crediting it with lower attrition.\nI feel that the best possible arrangement varies from team to team and company to company. What works for the data team within your company might not work for the marketing team.

It's an AI.\nMeet Yinglian Xie & Fang Yu, Founders of DataVisor\nWould You Vibe to The Sounds of AI\u2019s Tunes?\nArticles I\u2019ve Been Reading\n\u00a0 \nOnly 3 days left to enroll in \nGenerative AI for Business Executives.\nLearn how to identify and implement high-impact AI opportunities that drive real business value. \nExclusive for my newsletter readers: A \nspecial discount\n to join. \ud83d\ude0a \n\u00a0 \nNEWS YOU CAN\u2019T MISS\nYour Child's New Therapist? It's an AI.\nYoung people facing mental health challenges often have nowhere to turn. \nA DCPS Mental Health report found that \n6 in 10 teens \nexperience some form of mental health struggle, yet school resources remain limited. \nThe recommended ratio is one counselor per 250 students, but the national average is one per 376, and 17% of high schools don\u2019t have a counselor at all. \nThis escalating mental health crisis among students has prompted schools to explore the integration of AI-powered chatbots to support student well-being.\n\u00a0\nA \nrecent article from \nThe Wall Street Journal\n highlights this trend, focusing on \"Sonny,\" a chatbot developed by Sonar Mental Health.\nHere\u2019s how it works:\nStudents have access to Sonny during the hours of 8 a.m. to 2 a.m. Eastern time. During this period, a team of six staff members, working in shifts, monitors the ongoing conversations.\nStudents can text Sonny when they\u2019re feeling overwhelmed\u2014whether it\u2019s stress about school, personal struggles, or just needing someone to talk to.\nSince launching in 2024, it has supported over 4,500 students in nine school districts, many in rural or low-income areas.\nThe article included a screenshot of a check-in between Sonny and a student:\nFrom Sonny: \n\"Sonny here! Scale of 1-10: How's your motivation today? (no judgment \n\ud83d\ude0c\n)\"\nReply from user: \n\"3\"\nFrom Sonny:\n \"total mooood \n\ud83d\ude2d\ud83d\ude2d\n\"\nFrom Sonny: \"\nwhat been going on?\"\nExperts warn against AI replacing human support, but several parents have told me their tweens/teens are already discussing school problems with AI friends. \nLike it or not, it's happening. We need to focus on regulations to keep these AI companion companies accountable and ensure they're safe, especially for young users.\n\u00a0 \nWOMAN IN TECH\nMeet Yinglian Xie and Fang Yu, Founders of DataVisor\nYinglian Xie (right) and Fang Yu (left). Image: CODY PICKENS FOR FORBES\nCelebrating this week\u2019s Women in Tech \n\ud83e\udd73\n: \nMeet Yinglian Xie and Fang Yu, the scientists behind DataVisor\n, the AI risk and fraud detection company last valued at more than $250M.\nHow It All Started: \nXie ranked first out of 140 computer science students at Peking University and then earned her computer science Ph.D. from Carnegie Mellon focusing on connecting online security threats.\nYu \ninterned with the founding team of Microsoft Research Asia during her undergraduate studies at Fudan University and then \ncompleted her Ph.D. at UC Berkeley in internet security.\nGrowing up just 30 minutes apart in China, they met at Microsoft Research's Silicon Valley lab, collaborating for 7 years on security and bot detection research.\nEntrepreneurship Journey:\nIn 2013, Xie and Yu transformed their research into action by co-founding DataVisor.\n2015-2018\n: Secured first clients Yelp and Momo for fake review detection; raised $14.5M initially but struggled with strategy despite additional $40M funding.\n2022\n: Recognized the rapid digitization of financial systems and pivoted towards becoming a \u2018one-stop shop\u2018 for fraud prevention.\nCompletely redesigned their algorithms to protect the entire \"customer lifecycle,\" which meant it safeguards businesses from the moment a customer signs up for a service to every transaction they make.\nSuccess and Forbes Recognition:\nIn 2024, Data Visor\u2019s revenue surged 67% to $50 million. Major customers like SoFi, Affirm, and Marqeta now rely on their AI to stop fraud before it happens.\nAnd just last month, DataVisor landed on Forbes\u2019 Fintech 50 list. \n\ud83d\ude0e\n\u00a0\nI find Xie and Yu's journey truly inspiring and am impressed by both their technical brilliance and entrepreneurial resilience. \n\u00a0 \nWould You Vibe to The Sounds of AI\u2019s Tunes?\nAs a musician, the most symbolic form of protest is to go silent. And that is what many \nartists are doing to voice their disapproval against AI\n. \nOver 1,000 musicians, including Annie Lennox, Ed Sheeran and Dua Lipa, dropped an album called \u201cIs This What We Want?\u201d\n in protest against proposed changes to UK copyright law. These changes would let AI companies use artists\u2019 content to train models without permission, unless creators specifically opt out.\nI found this deeply moving: The album features sound recordings of empty studios and performance spaces, \nsymbolizing the potential silence of artists\n if these laws pass. \nWith the proposal raising questions about fairness and copyright, artists are uniting to protect their work and their livelihoods.\nHow do you feel about AI using artists\u2019 work to create its\u00a0own\u00a0tunes?\nHeartbroken. \ud83d\udc94 AI shouldn't come at the cost of using artist work without compensation. \nConflicted. \ud83e\udd14 I believe in using AI for creativity but we need to find a balance. \nUnfazed. \ud83e\udd37\u200d\u2640 The music industry\u00a0will\u00a0adapt. \n\u00a0 \nLATELY\nArticles I\u2019ve Been Reading:\nLonestar Data Holdings and Phison Electronics are taking data security to new heights\u2026literally. \nThe two companies have \nlaunched the first-ever lunar data center\n hardware, called \"Freedom,\" aboard a SpaceX Falcon 9 rocket. \nThe system, roughly the size of a hardcover book, carries 8TB of Phison\u2019s Pascari SSD storage and is scheduled to reach the moon on March 4, 2025. (This is a \ntest run\n to see if storing data off-Earth is possible.) \nThe idea is that the moon\u2019s environment\u2014free from weather, natural disasters, and cyber threats\u2014could be a safer place for storing important data. In contrast, Earth-based data centers face risks like hacking, power failures, and extreme weather. \nPhison\u2019s SSDs, built to withstand extreme space conditions, will store data for Lonestar\u2019s clients, including government agencies and private companies. \nIf successful, Lonestar hopes to expand lunar storage to a petabyte (1,000TB), providing a new option for long-term digital storage. As AI and data-driven industries grow, secure and resilient storage solutions are becoming more important. \n\u00a0 \nUntil next time! \nAyesha \u2764\ufe0f \nps.

For example, we pay you $X amount to turn a facilitated training into an EL.\nWe probably should get on a call to discuss, but I wanted to send this to you first so you could think on it. \n\ud83d\ude42\n\u00a0If you're interested in doing either above, LMK, and I'll schedule a time to chat.\n\u00a0\nThank you!\nNicole\n\u00a0\nNicole Barile\n\u00a0\n(She/Her)\nChief Operating Officer\nLCW\n\u00a0\nWebsite\n\u00a0\n|\n\u00a0\nTwitter\n\u00a0\n|\n\u00a0\nFacebook\n\u00a0\n|\n\u00a0\nLinkedIn\nView our upcoming events\n\u00a0| \nSign-up for our newsletter\n\u00a0\nFrom:\n Keri Luo <\nk.luo@lcwmail.com\n>\nSent:\n Thursday, February 13, 2025 2:35 PM\nTo:\n Nicole Barile <\nn.barile@lcwmail.com\n>\nSubject:\n RE: Questions about new ML build\n \n\u00a0\nI would estimate that developing a five-lesson course would take around 30-40 hours.\n\u00a0\n~Keri\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\nFrom:\n Nicole Barile <\nn.barile@lcwmail.com\n> \nSent:\n Thursday, February 13, 2025 12:47 PM\nTo:\n Keri Luo <\nk.luo@lcwmail.com\n>\nSubject:\n Re: Questions about new ML build\n\u00a0\nOK awesome, thanks for the quick reply.

It typically takes about 5 to 8 days to build.\nIf it\u2019s a microlearning, I will use Rise. (The storyline is for larger courses.) \nSame as #1. \nYes, both Rise and Storyline support translation into other languages (by exporting the course content as an XLIFF file, which can then be translated by translators and imported back into Rise to create a multilingual version of the course.) \u00a0\nYes, I can easily do that.\n\u00a0\nI hope that helps.

The New York Times is reporting that \nit\u2019s happening now, and AI is making it possible.\nStartups like Gamma, founded in 2020, demonstrate how lean teams can deliver outsized results. The AI-powered presentation and website maker has achieved such financial success that CEO Grant Lee confirms they require no additional funding.\nLee told the New York Times that\n with just 28 employees, they've reached profitability, \u201ctens of millions\u201d in recurring revenue, and nearly 50 million users.\n\u00a0\n\ud83e\udd2f \nSo how does Gamma use AI to grow so quickly and profitably with such few people? Here\u2019s how:\nIntercom\u2019s customer service tool\n to handle inquiries and resolve issues quickly, reducing the need for a large support team.\nMidjourney\u2019s image generator\n to create visuals fast, cutting down on time spent on creative work.\nAnthropic\u2019s Claude chatbot\n helps Gamma analyze data efficiently, providing actionable insights for decision-making.\nGoogle\u2019s NotebookLM\n accelerates the process of analyzing customer research, helping the team stay agile and informed.\nEngineers use \nAnysphere\u2019s Cursor\n to write code more quickly, enabling faster development with fewer resources.\nAnd Gamma isn\u2019t an outlier. \nSilicon Valley is buzzing about \"tiny teams\" - companies achieving impressive annual revenue with remarkably small workforces, leveraging AI to do what previously required hundreds of people. \nMidjourney\u2019s team of 10 hit $200M after just 2 years\nCursor\u2019s team of 20 hit $100M in 2 years\nMagnific and Aragon.ai hit $10M with teams of less than 10\nThe real takeaway here is that AI isn't just a tool to help you save a few minutes anymore. It\u2019s fundamentally changing how businesses structure themselves. \nThink you have \nthe next great million-dollar idea\n? You don't need massive investment or a massive workforce. With AI tools becoming commonplace, the playing field has never been more level. \n\ud83d\ude0e \n\u00a0 \nGenerative AI is redefining how businesses grow\u2014are you keeping up?\nSmaller teams are scaling faster by using AI to streamline work, cut costs, and focus on what truly drives growth,\n even in large organizations\n. It\u2019s no longer about hiring huge teams: it\u2019s about working smarter and knowing how to apply AI for real impact.\nA lot of leaders I talk to wonder where to start with Generative AI projects. That\u2019s exactly what I cover in my \nGenerative AI for Business Executives\n course\u2014practical strategies to make AI work for your business.\nThe next cohort starts in\n 5 days\n: If you\u2019re thinking about taking that first step, now\u2019s a good time.\nSecure Your Spot Today \n\u00a0 \nCould Cyborg Cockroaches Have Helped During the LA Fires?\nIn 2011, a massive earthquake and tsunami hit Japan, with rescue teams unable to locate as many as 18,000 people beneath the collapsed buildings.\nMotivated by the struggle to reach survivors in dangerous, tight spaces, Hirotaka Sato set out to create tech that could access those areas. \nTo do this, \nSato and his team of researchers at Osaka University and Diponegoro University in Indonesia are turning to cockroaches\n, nature\u2019s resilient little survivors. The team has developed tiny electronic devices that can be attached to cockroaches, combining their natural survival skills with tech to help them navigate complex environments. \nHere\u2019s how it works\n: \nSensors detect motion and obstacles, providing navigation commands when needed. \nOtherwise, the circuit stays out of the way, letting the insects navigate and recover from falls on their own.\nThe team tested the cyborgs on obstacle courses with sand, stones, and wood. Even in complex, unfamiliar environments, the cockroaches successfully overcame obstacles and reached their target.\nThe entire system is very energy-efficient, meaning the cockroaches can work longer than traditional robots in harsh environments. The \u201ccyborg cockroach\u201d offers several helpful applications:\nInspect areas that are too dangerous for humans to access, such as collapsed buildings or unstable structures.\nNavigate pipes, tunnels, and other confined spaces where robots cannot fit.\nPotential for deep-sea and space exploration, where oxygen is scarce or conditions are extreme.\nUse in delicate areas that require minimal human intervention, such as historical sites or archaeological digs.\nI can't help but think how helpful such cyborg cockroaches could've been in the recent \nLA\n\u00a0\nwildfires,\n which destroyed over 12,000 structures and forced 300,000 residents to evacuate. \n\ud83d\ude22\n Rescue teams faced unstable buildings and hidden dangers that made their work extremely hazardous.\nThese cyborg cockroaches could have crawled through debris, reaching trapped survivors and detecting hazards like gas leaks\u2014without putting human lives at risk.\nIt\u2019s interesting how the tech blends millions of years of evolution with today\u2019s tech. Cockroaches are notoriously resilient, so using them to navigate difficult environments is a no-brainer. My question is, how do they ensure the circuit itself stays safe?\n\u00a0 \nWould You Get This Robot Do Your Chores?\nProtoclone V1 is \na humanoid robot with 1,000 artificial muscles\n\u2014and an interesting trick: it sweats to stay cool.\nMost robots move with stiff, jerky motions because they rely on rigid motors. Protoclone V1 is different: it uses soft, pressurized \u201cmuscles\u201d that expand and contract like real human muscles, letting it move more smoothly and naturally while also conserving energy. A built-in water-based cooling system prevents overheating, mimicking how humans regulate temperature.\nClone Robotics says future versions could wash dishes, vacuum, fold laundry, and even make sandwiches. \nWhile I love the idea of a robot that vacuums and makes me sandwiches\u2026 a creepy, sweating robot lurking in my kitchen? \n\ud83d\ude28\n I\u2019d never be able to sleep. What do you think?\nWould you let this sweaty robot do your chores?\nYes, if it folds laundry, I\u2019ll ignore the fact that it\u2019s a possessed mannequin. \ud83d\ude01 \nMaybe\u2026 but only if it doesn\u2019t start smelling like a gym bro. \ud83e\udd14 \nA sweaty roommate? Feels like freshman year all over again. \ud83d\ude4a \n\u00a0 \nLATELY\nArticles I\u2019ve Been Reading:\nGoogle\u2019s AI \njust solved a decade-long scientific mystery in 2 days\n. \nProfessor Jos\u00e9 R. Penad\u00e9s and his team at Imperial College London spent years figuring out how superbugs become resistant to antibiotics. When they gave Google\u2019s AI \u201cco-scientist\u201d the same challenge, it reached the same conclusion in just 48 hours. \nIt didn\u2019t end there. The AI even suggested 4 more possible explanations, including one the team had never even considered and is now actively exploring. \nFor Penad\u00e9s, this is a turning point. Research has always been limited by how long it takes to form and test the right hypothesis. Today, AI is collapsing that timeline. Instead of spending years narrowing down possibilities, scientists can start from stronger hypotheses right away. \n\u00a0 \nUntil next time! \nAyesha \u2764\ufe0f \nps.

We've long been asked by customers big and small for the ability to: \nBook flights, hotels, rail, and car rentals from inside the app.\nLimit what inventory employees see to only what is in the authorized travel policy.\nPay for these bookings using a central virtual card.\nCapture the travel receipts into an automatic expense report.\nCut travel costs\nIn \nNew Expensify\n, press the green + button \n> Book travel\n (or in \nExpensify Classic\n, click the \nTravel\n button along the left side of the screen). It does all the things you expect (in-policy booking results, travel-based spend analysis, out-of-policy notices, approvals before booking, duty-of-care reporting), plus a few tricks you don't \u2013 courtesy of the realtime chat framework of the New Expensify superapp: \nRealtime duty of care\n, which lets you know where all your employees are at all times. We even connect the traveler and travel manager in a dedicated chat room to discuss all bookings and changes the instant they happen, rather than whenever you get around to checking your inbox.\nRealtime expense management,\n where every booking receipt and change fee is recorded as an expense that's submitted up through Expensify's realtime approval and next-day reimbursement engine: book today, get paid tomorrow!\nRealtime collaboration\n, where shared trip chat rooms are automatically created in New Expensify so that everyone is on the same page. From employees to managers, everything you need to know about your trip, all in one place. \nThe instant, chat-first design of New Expensify is why we like to say that Expensify does:\nTravel and expense at the speed of chat.\nTo check it out, open your Expensify app and click \nTravel\n, or take a peek below!\nIt's one of the most exciting times to be at Expensify that I can ever remember.

It's the moment an AI actually does its job, whether that's recognizing your face, translating text, or generating an image from your description.]\nThe Kingdom\u2019s Strategic Play: \nSpeed matters to Saudi Arabia because fast, efficient AI inference capabilities directly support Vision 2030's tech hubs, smart cities, and AI infrastructure that require real-time processing across urban management and financial services.\nThe Kingdom also aims to use Groq\u2019s high-speed inference capabilities to develop and improve its Arabic-language AI, including the ALLaM model, to smarter Arabic-speaking assistants, improved search engines, and enhanced medical diagnostics for the region.\nThe investment in Groq supports this goal by building state-of-the-art data centers and attracting top tech talent, enhancing AI inference capabilities for regional and global customers.\nThe strategic partnership with Groq is one of many steps the Kingdom is taking as it \ntransitions from oil dependency to a diversified, technology-driven economy\n while positioning itself as an emerging global AI hub\n. \n\ud83d\ude0e \n\u00a0 \nElon Musk\u2019s Grok 3 Chatbot is Really Good\nWhen Elon Musk launched xAI in 2023, skeptics questioned his ability to compete in the AI space. Yet within two years, he's released five versions of his Generative AI chatbot Grok, with \nGrok 3 gaining significant attention\n.\nUpon release, Grok saw mobile downloads increase tenfold, US daily users grow 260%, and web visits jump to 4.5 million globally. \n(ps. for context, Grok still trails far behind OpenAI's 400 million weekly active users). \nWhat Makes Grok Different?\nMassive Computing Power\n: Grok 3 was trained with 10x the computing resources of earlier versions on a supercomputer with 200,000 Nvidia GPUs.\nAlternative AI Approach\n: Unlike OpenAI, xAI focuses on AI gaming and X integration, positioning Grok for real-time social engagement.\nLive Information Updates\n: Grok pulls current data including real-time X updates, giving users more timely information than models with fixed training data.\nThe Good, The Bad and The Ugly: \nThe Good: \nMany users across social media report Grok 3 delivers impressive speed and capabilities compared to previous versions. \nThe Bad:\n The platform has faced controversy over performance measurement disputes with OpenAI.\nThe Ugly: \nThere are reports that Grok was preprogrammed to avoid sources claiming Musk spread misinformation. Eeek.\nI\u2019ve been using it and I think it\u2019s fast and analytical (I always use multiple AI chatbots including Perplexity, Claude, ChatGPT, Gemini and DeepSeek for my work and now have added Grok to the list as well).\nIt's free for all X users. Grok 3's paid version is called SuperGrok, which is priced at $30 per month. Try it out!\n\u00a0 \nWould You Let AI Fix Your Bad Pickup Lines?\nYou\u2019ve probably been there\u2014a dating app message that makes you cringe. Maybe it\u2019s way too forward, maybe it\u2019s just really weird. But what if AI could step in before things go off the rails?\nTinder and Hinge are testing a new AI feature that detects when a message might be too aggressive or inappropriate\n and prompts the sender to rethink before hitting send. 1 in 5 users actually change their message after seeing the warning.\nIt\u2019s a good move for safer, more respectful conversations. But it should stay a nudge, not a script. \nIf AI starts suggesting messages, it could let bad actors sound safe without actually being safe.\nWith Gen Z experiencing dating app fatigue, platforms are looking for ways to make online dating feel less exhausting. AI might be able to help, but can a pop-up really teach people to be better human beings? What do you think?\nWould you use a dating app that asks you to rethink your messages?\nYes! A small reminder can make conversations more thoughtful and kind. \u2764 \nMaybe, but I\u2019d rather people learn to be respectful on their own. \ud83e\udd14 \nNo way! It could help the wrong people seem\u00a0trustworthy.\u00a0\ud83d\ude21 \n\u00a0 \nLATELY\nArticles I\u2019ve Been Reading:\nDBS Group, Southeast Asia\u2019s largest bank, \nis phasing out 4,000 temporary and contract jobs over the next three years\n as AI takes on more tasks. With nearly 9,000 contract staff currently, the cuts will happen gradually through natural attrition\u2014meaning no sudden layoffs, and permanent employees remain unaffected. \nThis isn\u2019t just a DBS story. \nA Bloomberg Intelligence report estimates that AI could replace up to 200,000 banking jobs worldwide in the next five years as automation \ntakes over routine tasks in customer service, compliance, and back-office operations. \nDBS\u2019s decision highlights how automation is shifting jobs in the banking sector. \nIf you\u2019re a worker, this is only a reminder that the key is adjusting to a workplace where AI plays a bigger role. As routine tasks get automated, the focus will shift to skills like problem-solving, decision-making, and working with AI tools. \n\u00a0 \nIs your business ready to thrive in the AI-driven future?\n\"Where do I start with AI?\"\nThis is one of the most common questions I get from executives and business leaders. The real challenge isn\u2019t just understanding AI, it\u2019s knowing how to apply it for real impact. \nThat\u2019s exactly what I focus on in my \nGenerative AI for Business Executives\n course. \nOver the years, I\u2019ve helped leaders integrate AI to boost productivity, drive profitability, and create real business value. This course is designed to give you the practical insights and frameworks to do the same. \nIf you\u2019re ready to take that first step, \nsecure your spot\n today \ud83d\ude0e \nps.

But the company isn\u2019t without controversy.\nMedical experts caution that these high-resolution scans often detect minor, harmless abnormalities like small cysts or benign nodules. \nThis can lead to unnecessary follow-up tests, specialist visits, and anxiety over conditions that may resolve naturally.\nI strongly believe in proactive healthcare, but I've received conflicting medical advice - one doctor recommended such screenings while another cautioned against it.\nOne thing is clear: \nAI-powered diagnostics are the future of preventative healthcare.\n\u00a0 \nWorkday Is Making an HR Team for Your AI Agents\nImagine having AI Jensen Huang as an employee at your business. Image: NVIDIA\nWorkday, a major Human Resources and finance software provider, \nis introducing a new system to help businesses manage their AI agents in one place\n.\nWhat are AI agents?\nAI agents are computer programs that work independently of humans to complete tasks - like a virtual assistant scheduling your meetings, chatbots answering customer inquiries or agents handling complex tasks like making\n sophisticated decisions about alternate routes or suppliers.\nInvestors expect that AI agents offered by startups like Salesforce and Glean will become commonplace and become our \"digital colleagues\".\nA System to Manage AI agents\nCurrently, there's no structured way to oversee AI agents across an organization.\n This is why NVIDIA CEO Jensen Huang said that he envisions a future where IT teams function as the \"HR department\" for AI agents, overseeing their onboarding, training, and management.\nWorkday\u2019s Agent System of Record is one such \nHR equivalent for AI agents\n. It will give companies a way to see what each AI agent is doing, control who has access to them and track costs and overall impact.\nWhy this matters: \nWith AI agents managing sensitive company data like payroll, intellectual property and financial audits, they will have to be controlled and governed by a proper system. \nThe emergence of Workday\u2019s system underscores the growing recognition that AI agents will become integral components of the workforce and organizations will need a way to accommodate both human and AI labor.\n\u00a0 \nWould You Feed Your Pet Lab-Grown Treats?\nImage: Meatly\nEven our furry friends are getting a taste of the future now. \nLondon-based startup Meatly has launched \nthe world\u2019s first lab-grown meat treat for pets\n, now available in the UK.\nMade from cultured animal cells, lab-grown meat is designed to use less land, water, and resources than traditional meat production\u2014without harming animals. The pet treat, called \u201cChick Bites,\u201d contains 4% cultivated chicken and is currently in limited release.\nWith pet food accounting for 20% of global meat consumption, some see it as a step towards a more sustainable future. What do you think?\nWould you feed your dog lab-grown food?\nSustainable, ethical, and my pet won\u2019t know the difference? I\u2019m in. \ud83e\udd29 \nMaybe, but where\u2019s my lab-grown pizza? \ud83d\ude24 \nNo way, my pet eats nothing except real meat.\ud83d\udeab \n\u00a0 \nLATELY\nArticles I\u2019ve Been Reading:\nPerplexity \nhas introduced its freemium Deep Research tool\n, offering a more accessible option for those looking to conduct in-depth research. Unlike OpenAI\u2019s $200/month subscription, Perplexity offers a free version with limited daily queries, making it a more affordable choice for casual users. Paying subscribers get unlimited access, providing flexibility for those who need it. \nWhat sets this tool apart is its speed\u2014tasks are completed in under three minutes, compared to the 5 to 30 minutes it can take other tools. This means users can get detailed, citation-backed answers quickly, which could be useful for time-sensitive tasks. \nBenchmark scores put Perplexity ahead of Gemini and Grok but just behind OpenAI. \nps.

Video: Pixar\nEver walked into a room and immediately forgotten why you\u2019re there? Or Googled something only to forget it seconds later? You\u2019re not alone.\nScientists have found evidence that \ntech is changing the way we remember things\n\u2014how we store and retrieve memories. Instead of holding onto information, we\u2019ve learned to rely on digital tools to do the remembering for us.\nHere\u2019s what they found:\nWe remember where to find info, not the info itself\n: This is called the \u2018Google Effect\u2019\u2014our brains have learned that we don\u2019t need to store facts because Google will always be there to look them up.\nGPS is messing with our sense of direction\n: Studies show that people who rely on GPS struggle to recall routes later, just like those who\u2019ve never driven them at all.\nAI could take this even further\n: A study found that people who used Google to answer trivia questions thought they had better memory than those who answered without it\u2014just because they felt smarter.\nAI-generated info can rewrite our memory\n: AI doesn\u2019t just retrieve facts; it creates them. Chatbots sometimes generate false details, and over time, we might start believing things that never actually happened.\nShould you be worried? Well, our brains have always adapted to new ways of storing and finding information\u2014from telling stories around a fire to writing things down in books to looking everything up online. AI is just the latest step in that evolution.\nBut there\u2019s a key difference: \npast technologies helped us store and retrieve knowledge, while AI actively reshapes it. \nWe\u2019re not just outsourcing memory; we\u2019re relying on AI to filter, summarize, and even generate information for us. If we stop engaging with that process, the risk isn\u2019t just forgetting things\u2014it\u2019s losing the habit of thinking critically about what we\u2019re being told.\nSo go ahead and use AI as a tool, but let\u2019s all make sure we stay actively engaged with what you learn. Thinking critically is an invaluable skill in an age of AI. \u2665\ufe0f\n\u00a0 \nAre you leveraging Generative AI to drive business growth?\nJoin my course \u2018Generative AI for Business Executives\u2019, and gain the tools, strategies, and confidence to future-proof your organization. \nExclusive for my newsletter readers: A \nspecial discount\n to enroll. \ud83d\ude0a \nHere\u2019s what a recent participant had to say: \n\u201cThis is an awesome nugget-sized learning that can provide fundamental yet essential explanations of how Generative AI can impact businesses. Excellent!\u201d\n\u2014 Moira (Global Strategic Marketing Manager - LSEG) \n\u00a0 \nWOMAN IN TECH\nMeet Nancy Xu, Founder & CEO of Moonhub AI\nCelebrating this week's Woman in Tech \n\ud83e\udd73\n: Meet \nNancy Xu, founder and CEO of Moonhub\n, an AI-powered recruiting platform used by billion-dollar companies to hire top talent.\nBorn in China and raised in the US, Xu became \nthe first person to complete a dual PhD in AI and MBA at Stanford\n. She trained for the US Math and Physics teams as a student and later co-founded The Gradient, a widely read AI publication focused on research and industry developments.\nShe began her career at Meta\u2019s AI research division before leading healthcare AI and automation at AKASA.\nIn 2022, she founded Moonhub, aiming to improve hiring with AI. Unlike traditional recruiting tools that rely on keyword searches, Moonhub\u2019s AI scans billions of data points from platforms like LinkedIn, GitHub, and Google Scholar to identify qualified candidates. \nThe startup has seen remarkable success:\nSecured over $14M in funding from investors like Khosla Ventures, GV, and Marc Benioff.\nSurpassed $1M in revenue in its first year.\nUsed by 100+ companies, including \nAI unicorns like Inflection and Anthropic\n.\nBeyond Moonhub, Xu is an active investor through Xu Ventures, backing early-stage AI startups shaping the future of work. Her contributions to AI and the recruiting industry have earned her a spot on TIME\u2019s 100 Most Influential People in AI (2023).\nMy fave quote from Xu: \n\u201cOne of the biggest gifts that I've been given is access to opportunity. I believe that one of the best things and the greatest gifts you can give to anyone on this planet is access to opportunity.\u201d\n\u00a0 \nWould You Watch Robots Compete in Sports?\nVideo: Science X (YouTube)\nMove over, Cristiano. We have a new man of the match. \n\ud83d\ude0e \nScientists at Carnegie Mellon University and NVIDIA have developed \nan AI system that teaches robots to pull off signature moves from world-class athletes\n.\nIn a recent demonstration, a robot successfully performed Cristiano Ronaldo\u2019s mid-air spin and LeBron James\u2019 game-winning shot, which is a big deal when it comes to teaching robots full-body movement.\nThe system, called ASAP (Aligning Simulation and Real Physics), allows robots to study real sports footage, breaking down human motion and translating it into robotic actions with impressive accuracy.\nWhile it\u2019s a big advancement in robotics, many feel that their movements are still robotic and not very agile. The question remains, could professional robot sports become a thing, or would the lack of human finesse take the thrill out of the game? What do you think?\nWould you watch AI robot sports?\nYes! Finally, a team that won\u2019t blame the refs for losing. \ud83d\ude0e \nMaybe, but only if they can trash talk like the real pros. \ud83e\udd29 \nAnd miss out on real pros faking an injury for drama? Hard pass. \ud83d\ude12 \n\u00a0 \nLATELY\nArticles I\u2019ve Been Reading:\nSpain is set to \ncut its workweek from 40 to 37.5 hours starting next year\n, aiming to improve work-life balance. The proposal, championed by Labor Minister Yolanda D\u00edaz, faces opposition from business leaders, who walked out of negotiations, citing concerns over profitability and rigid corporate planning. \nThe measure, benefiting 13 million workers, follows last week\u2019s minimum wage hike and is part of the government\u2019s broader interventionist policies. While unions support it, critics draw parallels to France\u2019s controversial 35-hour workweek. With Spain\u2019s economy growing at 3.2% in 2024\u2014outpacing France, Italy, and Germany\u2014the move also seeks to boost voter support for Prime Minister Pedro S\u00e1nchez\u2019s government. \nThe bill\u2019s fate in Congress remains uncertain, hinging on pro-business Catalan and Basque nationalist parties. If passed, Spain would rank among the European countries with the shortest official workweeks. \ud83d\ude32 \n\u00a0 \nUntil next time! \nAyesha \u2764\ufe0f \nps.
