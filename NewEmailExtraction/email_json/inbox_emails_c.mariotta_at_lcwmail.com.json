There must be a misunderstanding here because I was quoted $1300 per language to get the deck fully translated (no speaker notes, just the slides plus the video subtitling). Please see attached email thread with Catalina. \n\u00a0\nSo the client is definitely expecting the cost to be less than $1300 per language. If you\u2019d like we can get on a call to clarify the project?

If you\u2019d like we can get on a call to clarify the project?

(I mention this because it can be confusing what they will do and what we will do)\u00a0 \nWe will just QA and not translate anything. Let\u2019s assume we\u2019re not creating subtitles.\nThe QA will involve: PDFS and VIDEOS. All the pdfs and the videos as indicated below and the Quiz in Zoom. \nYes.\nLanguages: Portuguese Brazil and Spanish (different scopes)\u00a0 \nYes\nCan you confirm this is correct? And reshare the files with me?\n\u00a0\nThe QA/Revision is paid per hour. I can estimate an approximate time once I have all the information.

I\u2019m speaking with Chuck and Nicole about allowing that, as long as we are able to QA the translation and approve them, keeping the integrity of the content and our intellectual property. \n\u00a0\nHow much would we typically charge a client to QA the Spanish (LatAm) and Portuguese (Brazil) translations for: \nThis PPT\n (video on slide 3 which has script in the speaker notes) and\nThis PPT\n: \nSlide 19: Video: \n\u00bfM\u00e9xico e racista o colorista?\u201d\u00a0\n \n(which came from \nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5fgOrV2uJUU\n) \n\u2013 video is on Spanish, so only needed to translate into PTB\nSlide 22: Video: \n\u00a0\u201cIndigenas Urbanos: Los desafios de los pueblos indigenas en ciudades\n\u201d (which came from \nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bl9viILCREM\n) \n\u2013 \nvideo is on Spanish, so only needed to translate into PTB\nSlide 30: Video: \u201cA Class Divided\u201d (see attached for script). \nThis video is located \nhere\n (in our Dropbox) but we only need until 8:42 (\u201c\u2026it\u2019s a horrid day\u201d). Even when I download the video from the workshop deck (which is 8:42) it provides me with the longer 13:25 version!\nThere is also a Quiz on Zoom which would also need translation (see attached for English).\n\u00a0\nWe\u2019d be QAing \nthe slides only (not the speaker notes\n, they will not translate those) and the \nvideos would need subtitles only\n. \n\u00a0\nAnd how much do we typically pay reviewers to do this?\n\u00a0\nGracias!\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\nRebecca M.

    "body": "Hi. No rush, but I need your help with the onboarding of new translators.\nCan you look at the attached \"Translator-Interpreter Profile\" doc & lmk if you would need to send this to new translators you hire? It looks like a way to capture their bank info (which SG could get off their invoice or other ways). And, it looks like it helps you track their rates. Let me know if you think you need to use this doc and/or make any\u00a0changes to it.\nI've also attached an email template I'm putting\u00a0together that you could send to new translators to get what you need in terms of paperwork. I added a bunch of things in red I'm still working on. What else would you want to include in this doc? Do you need to share info about Trados here or anything else? Feel free to edit the doc.\nI've also attached the updated Translator Agreement I am working on. Sending more of an FYI.\nI know this is a lot. It's not a rush as I said. I'm just trying to help get you everything you need to send to new translators.\nHappy to talk on thee phone about this another time too if easier.\nThanks!\nFrom:\n Accounting <accounting@lcwmail.com>\nSent:\n Tuesday, April 1, 2025 6:01 PM\nTo:\n Nicole Barile <n.barile@lcwmail.com>\nCc:\n Cecilia Mariotta <c.mariotta@lcwmail.com>\nSubject:\n RE: Invoicing language in Translator Agreement\n \n\u00a0\nHi Nicole,\n\u00a0\nSo the way we currently pay vendors, in order of preference, is:\n\u00a0\nACH to a US bank account\nPayPal\n(international wire, but the service we use is currently unavailable due to their vendor issues \u2013 I am looking into other options)\n\u00a0\nWe don\u2019t send physical checks anymore, it\u2019s electronic only. For US bank accounts, I need the vendor to provide an email address, and then I will send them an invite to create a QuickBooks Money account to manage their information (or send me routing & account). PayPal they just need to give me the email.\n\u00a0\nHope this is helpful, let me know if you need anything else \n\ud83d\ude0a\n\u00a0\nSG\n\u00a0\nFrom:\n Nicole Barile <n.barile@lcwmail.com> \nSent:\n Monday, March 31, 2025 16:01\nTo:\n Accounting <accounting@lcwmail.com>\nCc:\n Cecilia Mariotta <c.mariotta@lcwmail.com>\nSubject:\n Re: Invoicing language in Translator Agreement\n\u00a0\nHI again SG. I also found this old form (attached) that it seems we used to send to translators to get their banking info / payment preferences. Again, no rush, but can you also check if the attached is needed?

When you get a sec, can you please lmk if the below is still appropriate? I'm updating our Translation Agreement & think the below might be out of date. Thank you!\n\u00a0\n6.5. \u00a0LCW shall pay the Translator with a check drawn on a US bank (or with PayPal, if so requested by the translator) in US dollars (US$), within 30 days of receiving the invoice, unless agreed upon otherwise by both LCW and the Translator. All bank and processing fees for receiving the money are the responsibility of the translator.\n\u00a0\n6.6. \u00a0The Translator \nmay \nrequest payment via electronic funds transfer (wire transfer). In cases where the invoice amount exceeds US$1000.00, LCW will pay the outgoing wire transfer fees. For lesser amounts, the wire transfer may be requested by discounting the invoice by US$35.00 for international transfers and US$25 for domestic (US) transfers (the charge LCW incurs by initiating the wire transfer).\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\nNicole Barile\n\u00a0\n(She/Her)\nChief Operating Officer\nLCW\n\u00a0\nWebsite\n\u00a0\n|\n\u00a0\nTwitter\n\u00a0\n|\n\u00a0\nFacebook\n\u00a0\n|\n\u00a0\nLinkedIn\nView our upcoming events\n\u00a0| \nSign-up for our newsletter",
