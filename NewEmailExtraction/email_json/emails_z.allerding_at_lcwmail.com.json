As we approach the milestone of President Trump's first 100 days in office, many of our community members are feeling fear, worry, and overwhelm amid a whirlwind of executive orders and multiple reports of arbitrary green card and visa revocations. \u00a0The looming threat of a travel ban and troubling detainments of tourists and valid visa holders at airports have only intensified these anxieties.\u00a0\nThe recent ICE arrests and detainments of Mahmoud Khalil and Rumeysa Ozturk \u2013 and the attempted arrest of Yunseo Chung \u2013 are stark reminders that activists, organizers, and anyone speaking out could face similar consequences. With each new arbitrary arrest, the Trump administration is curtailing freedom of speech and violating the core tenets of our democracy. We must fight back against each new injustice and the rising tide of authoritarianism.\nAt Advancing Justice | Chicago, we are joining together with our allies to reject the Trump administration\u2019s cruel agenda. Earlier this week, I stood alongside the Illinois Coalition for Immigrant and Refugee Rights in\n condemning the rumored travel ban\n, which will restrict travel from more than 40 countries across Africa, Asia, and the Middle East. Our members will be joining a \nmass mobilization on April 5th\n to send a clear message that Chicagoans reject President Trump and Elon Musk\u2019s attacks on our communities. And we continue to organize concerned community members to advocate for local policy change to strengthen immigrant rights in Illinois.\nJoin us in making Illinois welcoming for all by attending Asian American Action Day on April 30th! Every year, the Pan-Asian Voter Empowerment Coalition mobilizes 300 Asian American community members to flood the state capitol in Springfield and advocate for our shared legislative agenda. This year, our priorities include:\u00a0\nStrengthening the Illinois TRUST Act, which prohibits collaboration between ICE and local police;\u00a0\nIncreasing funding for immigrant-serving organizations to provide language access, legal services, citizenship classes, and other critical services;\u00a0\nFunding inclusive history implementation at the K-12 level; and\u00a0\nEstablishing a cultural and religious calendar for K-12 schools.\u00a0\nAs we transition into spring, I hope you can join us in taking action and find ways to stay resilient. Although the challenges we face may feel overwhelming, we can find strength in community and work together to get through these trying times.\u00a0\nWith gratitude,\u00a0\n\u00a0\n \nGrace Pai\nExecutive Director\nAsian Americans Advancing Justice | Chicago\n \nNewsletter at a glance:\n \nPress Conference Condemning Rumored \nTravel Ban\u00a0\u00a0\nRemembering Tuyet Le\nSave the Date: AAA Day!

Describing it as an effective travel ban, the leaders highlighted numerous reports that foreign nationals and permanent residents are being singled out, detained, denied entry, and deported to third countries against their will. Speaking at the press conference, Advancing Justice | Chicago\u2019s executive director Grace Pai described these incidents as \u201cauthoritarian and unjust.\u201d\u00a0\nPresident Trump's leaked travel ban would restrict entry from 43 countries in the Middle East, Africa, and Asia. The draft, which has not yet been officially enacted, would impose a near-total ban on travel from countries such as Afghanistan, Iran, and Syria, while heavily restricting travel from 32 other nations. Because more than half of all Asian Americans immigrated to the U.S. from another country, Asian Americans would be particularly impacted by the proposed travel ban. Not only would family members lose the ability to visit each other for weddings, graduations, and funerals, but countless family visa and employment visa applications would also be put on indefinite hold.\u00a0\nThe press conference received extensive media coverage, with 10 outlets present. Please visit our website to view all media coverage from the event. \u00a0\u00a0\nChicago's Immigrant Leaders Rally Against Trump's Travel Ban Plans\nFederal Plaza rally targets proposed Trump travel ban 2.0 | WGN-TV\n\u00a0Remembering Tuyet Le\n \nThe Chicago Tribune published an obituary for former executive director of Advancing Justice | Chicago, \nTuyet Le\n, celebrating her life\u2019s work and her enduring impact on the fight for immigrant rights. Though Tuyet is no longer with us, her legacy continues through the work she inspired at Advancing Justice | Chicago and in the hearts of those she touched. \u00a0\n \nSave the Date: AAA Day!\nApril 30th, 2025\n \nWe are getting closer to the Pan-Asian Voter Empowerment (PAVE) Coalition\u2019s 12th annual Asian American Action Day (AAA Day) on April 30th in Springfield, Illinois!\u00a0\nThe PAVE Coalition consists of 19 Asian American advocacy and direct service organizations in the Chicagoland area. Founded in 2011, the PAVE Coalition focuses on increasing voter turnout and civic participation among Asian Americans and improving the lives of Asian Americans through advocacy and policy change.\u00a0\u00a0\nIn 2012, PAVE held the first Asian American Advocacy Day and launched the Asian American Caucus in Springfield. Policy is passed through stories. AAA Day gives us the opportunity to share our personal stories with elected officials and bring our demands to the forefront!\u00a0\n \nWe are excited to announce registration is now open to join us in Springfield!

Grace also took a moment to reflect on the legacy of Tuyet Le, Advancing Justice | Chicago's former executive director, who passed away last month.\u00a0\nWe invite you to listen to Grace\u2019s thoughtful and impactful interview! Here is the link: \nImmigration's Impact on Asian American Communities\n\u00a0\n\u00a0I Speak Power\u00a0\nAs the challenges of 2025 continue, ISP members and core leaders have remained focused on critical topics such as Know Your Rights/Know Your Power, Language Justice, and Immigration Justice. \u00a0During the holy month of Ramadan, many of our participants observe fasting and prayer, which has affected the scheduling of our weekly group meetings and workshops. However, we\u2019ve stayed committed by offering individual sessions to each participant, allowing for personalized mentorship. Looking ahead, we are preparing for an immigration justice workshop set for April 5th.\nKINETIC Updates\n \nIn March, KINETIC leaders hosted a workshop exploring the intersection of mutual aid and Know Your Rights (KYR) work. The event featured discussions on what mutual aid is\u2014and what it is not\u2014highlighting various examples of the practice both in Chicago and beyond. A central focus was how Know Your Rights initiatives align with the broader framework of mutual aid.\u00a0\nAfter the workshop, KINETIC youth led a Know Your Rights canvass in Chinatown with ORIGIN, the Coalition for a Better Chinese American Community's youth group. Together, they talked to community members and local businesses about their experiences with immigration enforcement and distributed KYR materials in Chinese, English, and Spanish.\u00a0\nOur April general meeting will be held on April 17th from 5:00\u20137:00 PM. Stay tuned for updates on social media and please email \njwang@advancingjustice-chicago.org \nfor the sign-up form.\u00a0\nKINETIC is a space for Asian Pacific Islander Desi high school youth, including multi-racial folks, to build community with other progressive Asian American students and develop as youth leaders and organizers. Drawing on their lived experiences and learning through political education, KINETIC leaders will participate in and lead issue campaigns on policies impacting their communities. Youth can sign up through the interest form below.\nKINETIC Interest Form!\n \nA Just Chi Updates\nIn March, A Just Chi welcomed community organizer Zhang Mazi to facilitate \u201cChina: A Radical Re-Introduction.\u201d Given ongoing US-China rivalry and the Trump administration\u2019s new tariffs, this workshop offered timely insights and context. Zhang shared a brief history of modern China, answered common questions to provide a more nuanced understanding, and shared resources to help members think more critically about the US-China relationship. \u00a0\nA Just Chi\u2019s April General Meeting is on Wednesday, April 16th from 6-7:30.
