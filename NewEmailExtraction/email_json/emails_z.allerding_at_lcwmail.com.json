As we approach the milestone of President Trump's first 100 days in office, many of our community members are feeling fear, worry, and overwhelm amid a whirlwind of executive orders and multiple reports of arbitrary green card and visa revocations. \u00a0The looming threat of a travel ban and troubling detainments of tourists and valid visa holders at airports have only intensified these anxieties.\u00a0\nThe recent ICE arrests and detainments of Mahmoud Khalil and Rumeysa Ozturk \u2013 and the attempted arrest of Yunseo Chung \u2013 are stark reminders that activists, organizers, and anyone speaking out could face similar consequences. With each new arbitrary arrest, the Trump administration is curtailing freedom of speech and violating the core tenets of our democracy. We must fight back against each new injustice and the rising tide of authoritarianism.\nAt Advancing Justice | Chicago, we are joining together with our allies to reject the Trump administration\u2019s cruel agenda. Earlier this week, I stood alongside the Illinois Coalition for Immigrant and Refugee Rights in\n condemning the rumored travel ban\n, which will restrict travel from more than 40 countries across Africa, Asia, and the Middle East. Our members will be joining a \nmass mobilization on April 5th\n to send a clear message that Chicagoans reject President Trump and Elon Musk\u2019s attacks on our communities. And we continue to organize concerned community members to advocate for local policy change to strengthen immigrant rights in Illinois.\nJoin us in making Illinois welcoming for all by attending Asian American Action Day on April 30th! Every year, the Pan-Asian Voter Empowerment Coalition mobilizes 300 Asian American community members to flood the state capitol in Springfield and advocate for our shared legislative agenda. This year, our priorities include:\u00a0\nStrengthening the Illinois TRUST Act, which prohibits collaboration between ICE and local police;\u00a0\nIncreasing funding for immigrant-serving organizations to provide language access, legal services, citizenship classes, and other critical services;\u00a0\nFunding inclusive history implementation at the K-12 level; and\u00a0\nEstablishing a cultural and religious calendar for K-12 schools.\u00a0\nAs we transition into spring, I hope you can join us in taking action and find ways to stay resilient. Although the challenges we face may feel overwhelming, we can find strength in community and work together to get through these trying times.\u00a0\nWith gratitude,\u00a0\n\u00a0\n \nGrace Pai\nExecutive Director\nAsian Americans Advancing Justice | Chicago\n \nNewsletter at a glance:\n \nPress Conference Condemning Rumored \nTravel Ban\u00a0\u00a0\nRemembering Tuyet Le\nSave the Date: AAA Day!

Describing it as an effective travel ban, the leaders highlighted numerous reports that foreign nationals and permanent residents are being singled out, detained, denied entry, and deported to third countries against their will. Speaking at the press conference, Advancing Justice | Chicago\u2019s executive director Grace Pai described these incidents as \u201cauthoritarian and unjust.\u201d\u00a0\nPresident Trump's leaked travel ban would restrict entry from 43 countries in the Middle East, Africa, and Asia. The draft, which has not yet been officially enacted, would impose a near-total ban on travel from countries such as Afghanistan, Iran, and Syria, while heavily restricting travel from 32 other nations. Because more than half of all Asian Americans immigrated to the U.S. from another country, Asian Americans would be particularly impacted by the proposed travel ban. Not only would family members lose the ability to visit each other for weddings, graduations, and funerals, but countless family visa and employment visa applications would also be put on indefinite hold.\u00a0\nThe press conference received extensive media coverage, with 10 outlets present. Please visit our website to view all media coverage from the event. \u00a0\u00a0\nChicago's Immigrant Leaders Rally Against Trump's Travel Ban Plans\nFederal Plaza rally targets proposed Trump travel ban 2.0 | WGN-TV\n\u00a0Remembering Tuyet Le\n \nThe Chicago Tribune published an obituary for former executive director of Advancing Justice | Chicago, \nTuyet Le\n, celebrating her life\u2019s work and her enduring impact on the fight for immigrant rights. Though Tuyet is no longer with us, her legacy continues through the work she inspired at Advancing Justice | Chicago and in the hearts of those she touched. \u00a0\n \nSave the Date: AAA Day!\nApril 30th, 2025\n \nWe are getting closer to the Pan-Asian Voter Empowerment (PAVE) Coalition\u2019s 12th annual Asian American Action Day (AAA Day) on April 30th in Springfield, Illinois!\u00a0\nThe PAVE Coalition consists of 19 Asian American advocacy and direct service organizations in the Chicagoland area. Founded in 2011, the PAVE Coalition focuses on increasing voter turnout and civic participation among Asian Americans and improving the lives of Asian Americans through advocacy and policy change.\u00a0\u00a0\nIn 2012, PAVE held the first Asian American Advocacy Day and launched the Asian American Caucus in Springfield. Policy is passed through stories. AAA Day gives us the opportunity to share our personal stories with elected officials and bring our demands to the forefront!\u00a0\n \nWe are excited to announce registration is now open to join us in Springfield!

Grace also took a moment to reflect on the legacy of Tuyet Le, Advancing Justice | Chicago's former executive director, who passed away last month.\u00a0\nWe invite you to listen to Grace\u2019s thoughtful and impactful interview! Here is the link: \nImmigration's Impact on Asian American Communities\n\u00a0\n\u00a0I Speak Power\u00a0\nAs the challenges of 2025 continue, ISP members and core leaders have remained focused on critical topics such as Know Your Rights/Know Your Power, Language Justice, and Immigration Justice. \u00a0During the holy month of Ramadan, many of our participants observe fasting and prayer, which has affected the scheduling of our weekly group meetings and workshops. However, we\u2019ve stayed committed by offering individual sessions to each participant, allowing for personalized mentorship. Looking ahead, we are preparing for an immigration justice workshop set for April 5th.\nKINETIC Updates\n \nIn March, KINETIC leaders hosted a workshop exploring the intersection of mutual aid and Know Your Rights (KYR) work. The event featured discussions on what mutual aid is\u2014and what it is not\u2014highlighting various examples of the practice both in Chicago and beyond. A central focus was how Know Your Rights initiatives align with the broader framework of mutual aid.\u00a0\nAfter the workshop, KINETIC youth led a Know Your Rights canvass in Chinatown with ORIGIN, the Coalition for a Better Chinese American Community's youth group. Together, they talked to community members and local businesses about their experiences with immigration enforcement and distributed KYR materials in Chinese, English, and Spanish.\u00a0\nOur April general meeting will be held on April 17th from 5:00\u20137:00 PM. Stay tuned for updates on social media and please email \njwang@advancingjustice-chicago.org \nfor the sign-up form.\u00a0\nKINETIC is a space for Asian Pacific Islander Desi high school youth, including multi-racial folks, to build community with other progressive Asian American students and develop as youth leaders and organizers. Drawing on their lived experiences and learning through political education, KINETIC leaders will participate in and lead issue campaigns on policies impacting their communities.

    "body": "You don't often get email from davidb@expensify.com. \nLearn why this is important\nIt's the season for reflecting on how last year went, and what can be done to make this year better.\u00a0 One common refrain is asking \"how did I end up spending so much on that?\"\u00a0 The answer is generally pretty simple: one small purchase at a time, with a steady trickle that added up faster than expected.\u00a0 With that in mind, \nwe're very happy to announce \"tag and category budgets\"\n \u2013 the easiest way to catch these financial leaks before they flood your basement.\u00a0\u00a0 \n \nThe feature works exactly as its name implies:\nEdit an \nexpense category or tag\n (like, \"Travel expenses\" or \"Project X\"). \nPick a \nbudget period\n (such as \"monthly\", or \"yearly\"). \nAssign a \ntotal workspace budget\n, summed across all workspace members (in case you have multiple, though this works great for sole-proprietors with no employees as well). \nAssign a \nper-member budget\n, to regulate each individual member's spend. \nHit Save, and we'll let you know:\nWhenever anyone spends over 50% (or whatever threshold you pick) of the budget for the first time this period. \nAnd again once the budget has been 100% used.\nThe notification is delivered via email, as well as in New Expensify to your workspace's #admins room, with a link taking you straight to the spend so you can update your forecast.\u00a0 It's an easy solution to a hard problem, and you can set it up three different ways:\nAsk your account manager to set up a call to walk you through it.\nRead more about \ntag and category budgets online\n. \nOr just hit \nedit\n on your favorite tag or category and set it up. \nAs the old saying goes:\u00a0\nThe best time to \nplant a tree\n \ncreate a budget was a long time ago.\u00a0 The next best time is right now.\u00a0\u00a0\n \nGive budgets a shot and make 2024 your best year yet!\n-david\nFounder and CEO of Expensify\nQuestions?\u00a0 Ask me on \nTwitter\n X! \n@dbarrett\n \nPS: \nNew Expensify\n is starting to get really good.\u00a0 It's already great at settling friend-to-friend debts, splitting bills between groups of friends, and chatting in groups across platforms (Android, iOS, web, with both your email and SMS contacts).\u00a0 But coming real soon here is full blown multi-organization enterprise chat and task management \u2013 not to mention a truly realtime take on financial collaboration inside and between companies.\u00a0 2024 is going to be a big year for the Expensify community.\u00a0 Get ready! \nSent by: Expensify, Inc. - 548 Market St #61434 - San Francisco, CA 94103\nTo unsubscribe, please click \nhere",

    "body": "tl;dr - \nRefer a K-12 teacher to Expensify.org\n so we can reimburse 50% of any purchase they make to help underprivileged students in their classrooms.\nAs fall begins, countless kids around the world have eagerly (or sullenly) returned to school. Many of them are very prepared. But not all are, and nobody is more qualified to know which kids need help than the teachers responsible for their care. One such teacher is Doug Bird, who thirty years ago (omg, how did I get so old) taught my drama class at Swan Valley High School (Go Vikings!) in Saginaw, Michigan. \nDoug (aka, Mr. Bird) had a huge impact upon my time in school, like countless millions of other teachers around the globe \u2013 and thirty years later, is still there, helping kids like me find their place in the world. But not all kids were as lucky as me, and able to show up to school with a backpack of books, a lunchbox of food, and the basic supplies to learn the basics of growing up in this world. \nThat's why it is depressingly common for extraordinary teachers like Mr. Bird to dip into their own pockets to help out the students in their classroom who are less fortunate. This can be as simple as a blank notebook and a handful of markers, as serious as a pair of clean socks and a winter coat that fits, or as sad as \npaying off a kid's lunch debt\n so they can have possibly the only hot meal of their day. \nIn fact, it's so common for teachers to spend their own money on the kids in their care, that here in the US the IRS has a special tax break just for teachers: the \nEducator Expense Deduction\n. It allows teachers to deduct up to $250 from their income tax as thanks for helping their kids out. \nBut it's not nearly enough\n, and Expensify.org wants to help them help their students. \nYou might have heard of New Expensify, our highly-simplified, chat-centric, from-scratch rewrite of Expensify Classic, that we've been working on for years as the foundation for the next generation of the product going forward. One feature of New Expensify is what we call, quite modestly, \"Save The World\". This isn't us saving the world. It's you saving the world. And the latest way you can do it, works like this: \nClick \nnew.expensify.com/teachersunite\n and sign in (or if you're already signed into Expensify Classic, click the green chat bubble in the bottom-right).\nClick the big green + button and choose \nSave The World\n.\nClick \nI know a teacher\n.\nThink of your favorite teacher. It could be someone who taught you, or someone who teaches your kids.\nEnter their email address or phone number, and we'll take it from there.\nSpecifically, we will split their classroom bill with them in 3 steps:\nThey scan the receipt of the next purchase they make on behalf of their kids.\nWe will confirm with their principal (ie, their boss) that it was in fact for kids in their classroom.\nWe reimburse them 50% (up to $50) from donations made to Expensify.org.\n \nIt's really that simple: you invite the teacher, and we'll pay them to help their kids. There's no catch \u2013 it doesn't cost you or them anything. We've got the money (a slice of every Expensify Card purchase goes to Expensify.org via our \nKarma Points program\n, in addition to our Corporate Karma and Personal Karma programs, as well as our network of incredible monthly donors \u2013 \njoin today!\n). We just need your help deciding who to give it to. \nSo please take a moment to help us help your favorite teacher, so they can help the students in their classroom who need it the most. These problems shouldn't exist. But they do, and kids are suffering as a result. Let's give them a hand, and bit by bit, let's save this world together. \nCheck out \nExpensify.org/teachersunite\n to learn more!\nThank you.\n-david\nFounder and CEO of Expensify\nQuestions? Ask me on \nTwitter\n X! \n@dbarrett\n \nPS: In case it wasn't already clear, Expensify.org is reimbursing teachers who are spending their own money, helping someone else's kids. These are true heroes, in every sense of the word. Accordingly, we feel very confident that the money is being well spent, because it's their money \u2013 we are only reimbursing half. Furthermore, we ask their principal (ie, their boss) to confirm every receipt is in fact going to help kids in their classroom, increasing our confidence further. This is the special and unique model of Expensify.org, which uses the power of modern expense management to laser target donor funds precisely to specific individuals in need, verified to the penny by receipt, and multiple layers of human review. \nPPS: To support the launch of Teachers Unite, we are sunsetting our SNAP campaign, which provided over $324,076.66 of groceries for over 6356 families since the onset of the pandemic. Though food insecurity is hardly a thing of the past, the pandemic thankfully is. Going forward we are moving away from emergency subsidies from Expensify.org to individual users, and towards campaigns like Teachers Unite that seek out and supercharge existing heroes who help people in need out of their own pockets. Expensify.org\u2019s mission is to \"empower individuals and communities to eliminate injustice around the world by making giving and volunteering more convenient, meaningful, and collaborative\". This is an incredibly exciting transition for us, and we've got lots more ideas in store! \nSent by: Expensify, Inc. - 548 Market St #61434 - San Francisco, CA 94103\nTo unsubscribe, please click \nhere",

    "subject": "[Expensify] Let our dedicated Account Managers expand your team",
    "body": "tl;dr - Your accounting team just got bigger! Ask your dedicated account manager what they can do for you.\nYou have likely noticed that we are aiming to offer the absolute best customer support in the industry. We started with a product that is extremely simple to set up and run. Then we added an AI-powered chat Concierge that reliably responds in under 2 minutes and is available 24/7. Now we're very happy to add dedicated account managers you can get to know on a first name basis, to help complete whatever setup, reconfiguration, or ongoing management issue you might have. How do you get one?\nIf you have 10 or more active seats, odds are you already have one! Go to \nSettings > Policies\n and click \nChat with Admins\n to be taken to the #admins chat room for your policy. Your account manager is already there and eager to talk to you via chat, or set up a call \u2013 whatever you prefer!\nIf you don't have 10 annual seats, go to \nSettings > Policies > Subscriptions\n, choose \nAnnual Subscription\n, and then choose a \nSubscription Size\n of 10 or more. A dedicated account manager will reach out instantly.\nWhat can your account manager do for you? Ask and find out! But some suggestions:\nPrice check.\n Are you using the right mix of annual and pay-per-use seats? Are you aware of how the Expensify Card can not only slash your bill, but possibly earn you more in cashback than the bill itself? Let us analyze your activity, bill, and spending patterns to make the best recommendation.\nHealth check.\n When's the last time you really took a look at your Expensify settings? Let us do a quick review of your latest requirements based on how your company has changed against the latest features in our toolbox, to find the perfect blend for you.\nChange management.\n Are you thinking of switching accounting or HR systems? Switching banks (ahem, possibly in a hurry)? Adopting a corporate card program? Adding international entities? Let us know and we'll help you plan and execute a seamless migration. \nNote: Another feature coming along for the ride is \"policy change logs\" \u2013 now any change to key policy settings will be recorded in the #admins room for that policy, creating a historical audit trail of who changed what. This way if you ask your account manager to make a change for you, you'll see exactly what was done, when, and by whom.\nReporting.\n Need to download data as a CSV? Whip it into a PivotTable? Visualize it with pretty charts? Let us know your data dream, and we'll take care of it!\nCompliance.\n Are you newly public or thinking about starting the journey? As a newly public company that just got SOX compliant, we feel that pain \u2013 let us alleviate it for you. Whether you're being audited to AICPA or PCAOB, SOC or SOX, we're in your corner.\nExpensify is simple enough to be self-serviced, if you prefer (especially with our \nnewly revamped help site\n). But included in your base subscription is access to our award winning managed service, so you might as well take it for a spin!\n-david\nFounder and CEO of Expensify\nQuestions?

Word of mouth is the backbone of our business. We solve your need to transcribe receipts and input information into a spreadsheet. In return, many of you tell your friends and submit reports to a boss who ultimately adopts Expensify for the team. This is how we acquired more than 12 million users, and we are eternally grateful for that. The Expensify community would not be what it is today without our incredible champions out there. Now we want to flip the script and give you a little thank you for telling people about us.\u00a0\u00a0\nFrom now on, every time you bring a user into the platform who directly (or indirectly, more below) goes on to adopt Expensify, we will pay you $250.

    "subject": "[Expensify] Magic links make signing in faster, easier, and more secure",
    "body": "Our goal is to make Expensify a little better every day in every way, and today's the day that we upgrade a very important flow: signing in.\ntl;dr - Starting today, you don't need your password to sign in.\u00a0 Instead, we send a \"magic link\" to your email/phone to confirm you are you, and you are let in with a click. This is a phased roll-out so some of you will see this change sooner than others.\nThis is called a \"passwordless\" signin flow, which is widely recognized by the security industry as being a much better balance of security and convenience than the traditional password, for the following reasons:\nThe only way to remember a different password for each service is to make each password super simple, which is easy for an attacker to crack.\nThe only way to make a password hard to crack is to make it hard to memorize, which means you generally share the same password between many services.\u00a0 But then when one service is hacked, the attackers get access to all the others.\nThe only way to not share secure passwords between sites is to use a password manager to store them all, which makes them \na lucrative target\n.\nThe only way to protect against mass leak of all your passwords is to change them frequently but \nchanging your password often is actually insecure too\n.\nNo matter how you slice it, passwords are a bad solution to an important problem. It's been over a century since \nspeakeasies stopped using passwords\n in the prohibition era 1920's, it's long past due we stop using them to secure our most important financial data.\u00a0 So here's how Expensify's new signin process works:\nImagine you go to expensify.com, or install the Expensify app.\nYou enter your email address or phone number to sign in.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0a. Note: If your company uses SAML or SSO for signin (either of which might prompt you for a password), those keep working \u2013 you are unaffected.\nA \"magic link\" will be emailed/texted to you \u2013 just click that link (or manually enter the \"magic code\"), and voila, you are signed in, quickly and securely, like magic!\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0a. Note: If you've \nenabled two-factor authentication (2FA) using a \"one time password\" (OTP) authenticator\n \u2013 which is a mouthful, but it's actually very easy and we strongly recommend it \u2013 you'll be asked to enter your signin code after clicking the magic link.\nYour app will stay signed in unless we need to re-confirm your access\u00a0 (eg, if you change your account\u2019s login email or phone number), at which time a new magic link will be sent to reauthenticate you.\nIt's a much better, safer, easier, and more convenient flow, and is fully rolled out for all accounts that formerly used Expensify passwords.\u00a0 Other than just enjoying this new feature, you shouldn't need to do anything special.\u00a0 However, it's probably a good time to:\nUpdate your mobile app, to make sure it has the latest magic signin flow.\nReview your Secondary Logins under \nSettings > Account > Account Details > Secondary Logins\n to ensure your logins listed are updated.\nSecure your account through \ntwo-factor authentication (2FA)\nThis is just one of many, many layered defenses Expensify has to protect your account data and financial flows. That now includes PCI level 1 certification, the highest level of security for businesses that manage credit card data.\u00a0 If you have any questions at all about this new way to secure your account, just respond to this email and we'll help you out.\u00a0 Thanks!\n-david\nFounder and CEO of Expensify\nQuestions?\u00a0 Ask me on Twitter!\u00a0 \n@dbarrett\n \nPS: This is probably obvious, but just in case you are wondering why we care so much about security: Expensify isn't just a place you go to talk.\u00a0 We process billions of real dollars.\u00a0 Accordingly, securing your account means securing your \nExpensify Card\n, your \nnext day reimbursement \nflow, your \ninvoiced income\n and \nbill payments\n.\u00a0 We are a single superapp that not only handles every financial flow for your business, but with our focus on Send/Request Money in \nNew Expensify\n, also your personal payments.\u00a0 So I hope you'll take the security of your account as seriously as we do!\nSent by: Expensify, Inc. - 548 Market St #61434 - San Francisco, CA 94103\nTo unsubscribe, please click \nhere",

    "subject": "[Expensify] Work like a boss in our San Francisco Lounge with complimentary cocktails, espresso, and more",
    "body": "tl;dr - Whether you live in San Francisco or are just passing through, come work alongside other digital nomads at our brand new \nExpensify Lounge\n! \nWhat: Indulge in \nfabulous espresso drinks, craft cocktails\n, and astonishing views\nWhere: 16th floor of \n88 Kearny St\n, San Francisco \u2013 in the heart of the financial district\nWhen: \nStarting April 24th\n, open M-F, 8 am to 6 pm\nHow: Just show up, sign in to wifi, and Concierge will \ndeliver drinks to your seat\nCapacity's limited, and we're currently admitting on a first-come-first-serve basis, so come early and stay for \nsunset champagne sabering\n! \nDoes your office look like this? Ours does! And yours can too, because our ufficio es su ufficio:\n \nDuring COVID, we went through an amazing transformation from an office space to this lounge for any Expensify member to work out of as often as they like, with complimentary drinks of all kinds. \nThink of it like \"high-end airport lounge\" meets \"co-working space\", optimized for like-minded individuals -- coffee in the morning and cocktails at night (or the reverse, no judgment) -- built into your existing Expensify membership, for as low as $9/mo. \nBecause Expensify isn't just a tool, it's a way of life. It's a community of people who want to GSD while living rich, having fun, and saving the world. Meet other members of the community in person, and not only is the first round on us, all of them are. \nIf you\u2019re in San Francisco, come on in! If you\u2019re somewhere else, reply to this email with the city you live in to help us choose our next lounge location. \n-david\nFounder and CEO of Expensify\nQuestions? Ask me on Twitter! \n@dbarrett\n \nPS: For a bit of backstory, we actually started this pre-COVID, in response to a strange problem. \nThough Expensify started in SF, we\u2019ve been hiring outside of SF for over a decade, and decided to pay everyone SF wages, no matter where they lived. Bit by bit, our SF crew saw that you can succeed at Expensify from anywhere in the world, which led to people questioning if SF was the right place for them and their growing families. \nThis diaspora was aggravated further by our super high employee retention (2/3rd have been here over 4 years and 20% of folks over 8), which means people grew and their lives changed while here. They got dogs, and spouses, and kids (generally in that order), and kind of concluded they'd had enough of the \"San Francisco experience\" -- and wanted to try the PDX, NYC, MEL, or LHR experience (where we have other locations), or dozens of other cities around the world, or just become digital nomads entirely. \nSlowly but inexorably, we saw attendance in our SF office drop, risking it becoming a very, very well-appointed ghostland. We asked ourselves: \"How do we preserve the vibrancy of the office for those who do want to stay in SF?\" To answer that question, we started looking at where those who left were going to -- and we realized they were by and large going to far flung locations, and then working out of cafes. \nNow, we already have a lot of experience with the WFC (Work From Cafe) lifestyle from our \nannual trips abroad as a company\n. And we already knew firsthand that there was something magical about that tiny cafe in Hanoi that made it so much more fun to work from than even the best office in San Francisco. So after a lot of soul searching, we boiled it down to three main components: \n1) Great coffee.\n Not average coffee from some giant vat. Fresh ground, single-origin pour-over coffee. Freshly pulled espresso shots into a steamy cappuccino. Coffee so good you don't feel compelled to go to a coffee shop, because you are already in one. \n2) Great cocktails.\n We've got employees all over the world, so the sun never sets on the Expensify empire. But even when we were all in SF, the startup life doesn't end at sunset -- and at some point, you've just had too much coffee and want a change. Sometimes you want to code with a hand-mixed Old Fashioned by your side, kept cold by a giant ice cube. The Ballmer Peak is real. \n3) Great company. \nBut not your company.\n The one thing a cafe has that your office doesn't, is someone you work beside, but not with. As social media lowers barriers to meeting people online, it raises them between us in person, and the cafe is the last bastion where you can credibly meet someone new -- to hear a new perspective or discover a new opportunity. \nArmed with these epiphanies, we did what anybody would do: turn our office into the best co-working cafe in the city. We added a ridiculously over-the-top cocktail bar like you'd find tucked away in a Tokyo highrise and put in an espresso bar even us Portland coffee snobs can respect. Then we paired it with our integrated chat Concierge to offer to-your-seat delivery, powered it with our New Expensify chat system, and then dialed up the overall furnishings to 11. \nAnd you're welcome to come work here. I guarantee it's better than your office, or any office, and it's designed to be a better place to work than any cafe in the city, too. \nBut the open secret is that we didn't actually do it for you. We did it for us, to make our own lives better by having you in them. So if you come by, we don't say \"thank you\" to be polite. We mean it, we're glad to have you here. \nSent by: Expensify, Inc. - 548 Market St #61434 - San Francisco, CA 94103\nTo unsubscribe, please click \nhere",

    "body": "Every \nExpensiCon\n has been hallmarked by a keynote discussion with an interesting customer \u2013 and given our tens of thousands of customers around the world, that gives us a lot of options.\nThe first customer we picked for the first ExpensiCon was Xero, represented by its then-CEO Rod Drury, who shared insights on how to build a multinational organization from the ground up and bring modern solutions to the SMB. The second customer was Bill.com, represented by its CEO Rene Lacerte, who talked about the need to balance your commitments to both your professional and personal life while being an effective leader.\nThis time around, our featured customer is the Clooney Foundation for Justice, represented by its co-founder, Oscar-winning actor & filmmaker \nGeorge Clooney\n.\u00a0 As a recipient of the AFI Life Achievement Award, two Academy Awards, and the Nobel Peace Laureates\u2019 Peace Summit Award \u2013 \nwe can think of no single individual who better demonstrates our ideals of Living Rich, Having Fun, and Saving the World.\nGeorge's legendary career as a film star in iconic films such as the Oceans trilogy, O Brother, Where Art Thou? or (my personal favorite) Solaris requires no introduction.\u00a0 And on top of it, his Casamigos Tequila quickly became a standard on top shelves worldwide.\u00a0\nHowever, what excites me the most is to talk with George about his incredible advocacy for freedom, democracy, and human rights around the world.\u00a0 In 2016, Amal and George established the Clooney Foundation for Justice to advance justice through accountability for human rights abuses around the world.\u00a0 Whether defending women in unjust courtrooms, negotiating the release of detained journalists, or aiding those experiencing the horrible atrocity of violence, the Clooney Foundation for Justice is a powerful force for good that should inspire us all.\nRegardless, as incredible as that will be, he is just one of many speakers covering a wide range of topics, from accounting to\u2026 something starting with Z.\u00a0 Guests at ExpensiCon will mingle with speakers, and \u2013 more importantly \u2013 with the other guests, in breakout sessions, at dinner, over drinks, or in the pool.\u00a0 There is truly no event like this in the world (and it doesn't come along often) so if you haven't already signed up, please head to \nExpensiCon.com\n to register your interest today.\u00a0 \nIt's all expenses paid\n, so what have you got to lose?\nI can't wait to see you there.\n-david\nFounder and CEO of Expensify\nQuestions?\u00a0 Ask me on Twitter!\u00a0 \n@dbarrett\n \nPS: If you\u2019re not already in the running to \nwin your spot at ExpensiCon\n - there\u2019s still time, so get started today! Five lucky winners will not only score an all-expenses paid trip (with a guest!) to ExpensiCon in Italy, they\u2019ll also \nmeet George Clooney \nat an exclusive VIP event!\u00a0\nPPS: Not an ExpensifyApproved! Accountant yet?\u00a0 No problem, it costs nothing and you get killer perks for your firm and clients. Some notable ones include:\nPartner Manager - a dedicated point of contact for escalations, firmwide trainings, strategic goal planning, and new initiatives.\nClient Setup Specialist - an onboarding expert to help accountants implement Expensify for their clients, configure accounting integrations, and more.\nClient Account Manager - a day-to-day product specialist for any client questions that come up, with best practices in mind along the way.\nSpecial client pricing - with no annual commitment, so your firm can adapt as new clients onboard or previous clients move everything in-house.\nGet started \nhere\n. \nSent by: Expensify, Inc. - 548 Market St #61434 - San Francisco, CA 94103\nTo unsubscribe, please click \nhere",

    "body": "The tools you need to uncover the pockets of toxicity in your organization, put words to what's wrong, and find out whether your teams need to increase their levels of psychological safety.\n \n \nDoes Your Organization Have Psychological Safety?\u00a0\n\u00a0\nSometimes it's hard to tell. Over time we become numb to the pains and discomfort of punished vulnerability and forget what it feels like to live without fear at work. But it doesn't have to be that way. In this week's newsletter we'll give you the tools you need to put words to what's wrong, uncover the pockets of toxicity in your organization, and find out whether your teams need to increase their levels of psychological safety.\nWhat is Psychological Safety?\n \n \nIn this week\u2019s episode of the Culture by Design podcast, Timothy R. Clark is joined by Melody Wilding, author of \nTrust Yourself: Stop Overthinking and Channel Your Emotions for Success at Work. \nAs an executive coach, professor of Human Behavior, licensed social worker, and Harvard Business Review contributor, Melody has lots to say about how burnout, ambition, sensitivity and empathy.\n\u00a0\nListen to this episode of the\u00a0\nCulture by Design Podcast,\n \"\nInvest in Your Well-Being\n\" available on all channels.\u00a0\nListen Now\n \n \nIn a previous episode of the Culture by Design podcast, Dr. Timothy R. Clark invites Nicki Eyre to talk about navigating workplace bullying from both the individual and organizational level, why encouraging a speak-up culture is not enough, and how to have both performance and cultural accountability for individual contributors and leaders.\n\u00a0\nListen to this episode of the\u00a0\nCulture by Design Podcast,\n \"Navigating Workplace Bullying\" available on all channels.\u00a0\nListen Now\n \n \nIs Your Boss Actively Toxic\nor Passively Complicit?\nAlthough we expect it to be obvious, most toxic behavior is subtle. Subtlety is safer than blatant toxicity because it gives the perpetrator deniability. If we were to give you a menu of subtle behaviors it might include: \n\u00a0\n1. Ignoring a question\n2. Neglecting a visible need\n3. Holding back feedback deliberately to maintain ambiguity\n4. Withholding time and attention\n5. Excluding someone from a meeting or conversation\n6. Piling on the work under the guise of mock appreciation.\n\u00a0\nKeep reading to learn how you can identify your leader's tendencies, because teams and organizations don\u2019t outperform their bosses, they reflect them. That\u2019s why sources of toxicity must be identified and either removed or coached.\nRead the Full Article\n \n \nHow to Spot a Toxic Culture in a Job Interview\n\u00a0\nOne of the hardest questions you can ask an interviewer is: \"Can you tell me about your organization's culture?\" They may give you vague answers about pizza parties and casual Fridays, a scripted response that is less-than-believable, or may not know how to answer the question at all. The last thing you want is to accept a job without knowing anything about the culture you're walking into.
