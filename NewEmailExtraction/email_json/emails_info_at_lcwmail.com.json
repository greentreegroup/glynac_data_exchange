    "body": "Click here for the webversion\nDear Ms Fagrelius,\nThree months have passed since the 15th edition of the \nLanguages & The Media\n conference took place in \nBudapest\n, where professionals and academics from around the world gathered to share their latest research and insights into media localization practices.\nYou will find the \npost-conference report here\n, which offers an overview of the event\u2019s workshops and sessions, key statistics, participating organizations, sponsors, exhibitors, and a selection of our favourite photos that best capture the energy and vibrant atmosphere of our three-day gathering.\nEven this report, however, cannot fully reflect the depth of knowledge presented by the 106 speakers across 28 sessions and 4 workshops. Given the high demand for access to these insightful presentations, we are delighted to announce the launch of \nOnStage\n, a free directory featuring contributions by professionals and scholars in the media localization industry.\nInspired by the \n2024 Languages & The Media\n conference, \nOnStage\n serves as a dedicated knowledge-sharing space where experts can showcase their work, including white papers, case studies, conference presentations, journal articles, videos, and more. The initiative is hosted by our 2024 gold sponsor, \nOOONA\n, in recognition of the invaluable insights shared at industry events, ensuring they remain accessible to educators, researchers, and professionals in the field.\nWe encourage you to explore \nOnStage\n as a valuable resource for everyone in media localization. We also invite you to contribute your own work\u2014from \nLanguages & The Media\n or other industry events\u2014to share it with the global media localization community.\nYou can access \nOnStage\n and submit your contributions at \nhttps://www.ooona.net/onstage/\n. No registration is required.\nWe also look forward to welcoming you to the next edition of \nLanguages & The Media\n, taking place at the \nSenate House, London\n, from \nNovember 4-6, 2026\n!\nWith warm regards,\nYour Languages & The Media Team\nGold Sponsors\nSilver Sponsor\nSponsors\nLive Captioning Sponsor\nAssociation Partners\nMedia Partners\nLanguages & The Media Secretariat:\nICWE GmbH\nLeibnizstrasse 32\n10625 Berlin, Germany\nTel.: +49 (0)30 310 18 18-0\nFax: +49 (0)30 324 98 33\ncontact: \ninfo@icwe.net\nContact Us\n\u00a0\nGeneral Terms & Conditions\n\u00a0\nPrivacy Policy\n\u00a0\nUnsubscribe",
