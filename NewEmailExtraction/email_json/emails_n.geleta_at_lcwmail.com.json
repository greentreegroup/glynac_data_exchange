    "subject": "Why live music costs so much",
    "body": "Plus: Our writers on the Supreme Court's affirmative-action decision \nThursday, June 29, 2023 \n \nThe Latest\nToday, the Supreme Court ruled that the race-conscious admissions programs as practiced at the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill and Harvard are unconstitutional, upending more than four decades of precedent on the use of race in college admissions.\nSpend time with our writers\u2019 analysis of the decision:\n\u201cRace neutral\u201d is the new \u201cseparate but equal,\u201d Uma Mazyck Jayakumar and Ibram X. Kendi argue.\nThe decision takes a tool meant to prevent discrimination against Black Americans and turns it on its head, Adam Harris explains.\nCurtailing affirmative action is a blow against a rising generation, Ronald Brownstein argues.\n \nLora Kelley\n \nAssociate editor\nThe price of attending blockbuster concerts is astronomical, but Americans are still buying tickets. Why, in our weird economic moment, is live music a priority?\nFirst, here are three more new stories from \nThe Atlantic\n:\nRussia has reached a dead end.\nThe end of optimism in China\n\u201cMy dad had dementia. He also had Facebook.\u201d\nFleeting and Scarce\n \nTaylor Swift performs at Ford Field on June 9 in Detroit. \n(Scott Legato / TAS23 / Getty Images for TAS Rights Management)\n \nView in browser\nFor the past few months, my Instagram feed has been peppered with posts of people going to see the Taylor Swift \nEras tour\n in various cities around the country. Friends and their friends, bedecked in cowboy boots, glitter, and beaded bracelets, are sharing giddy stories from stadium parking lots and nosebleed seats. I\u2019m happy for them\u2014it looks like fun!\u2014and, frankly, I\u2019m also wondering how they all scored tickets.\nTickets to the show were difficult to get on Ticketmaster, to put it mildly. So chaotic was the presale in November that Swift herself likened the process to \u201cbear attacks.\u201d It prompted a Senate Judiciary subcommittee to initiate a \nhearing\n on lack of competition in the concert-ticket industry. Resold tickets went for many hundreds, or even thousands, of dollars.\nI have become curious in recent months about why, in a period of high inflation and financial strain for many Americans, some people are so willing to shell out for concert tickets. It\u2019s not just Taylor\u2014\nBeyonc\u00e9\n and \nBruce Springsteen\n are also among the superstars who are selling out stadiums while \ncharging\n hundreds or thousands of dollars for passes to their blockbuster shows.\nThe obvious reason is that these artists are great, and many fans who can (\neven loosely\n) afford to see them want to. Unemployment is low, and some fans have discretionary income they are open to spending. People have deepened their relationship with musicians during the coronavirus pandemic, my colleague Spencer Kornhaber told me. He said that the huge appetite for concerts we are seeing now may be a \u201clagging indicator of that demand for experience.\u201d\nConcert tickets are not the stalwart inflation indicator that gas fluctuations or egg prices are, but how people approach them tells us a lot about the ways Americans are spending their money. Rapidly \nrising prices for services\n\u2014including items such as concert tickets\u2014are now responsible for a bigger portion of overall inflation than they have been in years past. As grocery inflation moderates and gas prices go down, the prices of services remain stubbornly high. (That \ncategory\n includes a range of nonphysical items that rely on labor, including hospital care and school tuition as well as event tickets.) Even as the Fed cranks up interest rates to try to curb consumer spending, these categories seem to be resistant. \u201cWe\u2019re not seeing that slowdown in [the cost of] services we expected,\u201d Jason Mercer, a live-entertainment analyst at Moody\u2019s Investors Service, told me. One possible reason that prices are high, he added, is that concert organizers and artists are \u201ctaking advantage\u201d of pent-up demand from consumers after years without live events.\nHow people are spending their money is a good indicator of how they are feeling. If someone is signing a long-term lease or buying a house, that suggests they feel optimistic about the future (at least optimistic enough that they are willing to enter a long-term financial engagement, which they expect they will have enough money to continue). But if someone is buying a concert ticket, that tells us more about how they are feeling right then, in that moment, as the \nNew York Times\n reporter Jeanna Smialek explained on a recent \nepisode\n of the \nTimes\n podcast \nThe Daily\n. Tickets are a onetime purchase\u2014though they can be a major one, and are becoming pricier.\nThe average resale price for concert tickets went from $116 over a three-month period in mid-2019 to $240 over the same period this year, according to data SeatGeek shared with me. And the inflation rate for \u201clive performing admission events\u201d is currently 2.6 percent higher than overall inflation in the U.S., \nReuters\n reported. (In a paper on \u201crockonomics,\u201d Princeton \nresearchers\n found that from the late 1980s through early 2000s, concert-ticket prices outpaced inflation.)\nA number of factors are causing ticket prices to spike. Even before the pandemic, the costs of running a large show\u2014factoring in artists, vendors, venues, promoters, and others\u2014were high. Now \nnew variables\n,\n such as supply-chain disruptions\n and \nCOVID-related delay\ns, have made it even pricier. Mercer, the Moody\u2019s analyst, told me that artists, who help set the initial price for concert tickets, may also be influenced by seeing others raise prices: \u201cIt's almost as though one artist sets a new bar and then the next artist can take it from there.\u201d\nMany people are also blaming Ticketmaster, whose parent company, Live Nation, controls a significant share of the live-music-ticketing market, for exorbitant prices and fees. In January, the Senate Judiciary Committee \nheld a hearing\n about the effects of the company\u2019s dominance. (The musician Clyde Lawrence began his testimony, \u201cGood morning, senators, and thank you for inviting us today to the most unique gig we\u2019ve had in years.\u201d) Some artists have tried to resist Ticketmaster. Robert Smith of The Cure successfully pressured the company to refund some fees this spring, and Maggie Rogers announced that she would sell some tickets for her Summer of \u201923 Tour in person. (Asked for comment about ticket prices and their fee calculation, Ticketmaster passed along links to \nblog\n \nposts\n and other publicly available information. Their testimony in the January Senate hearing can be read \nhere\n.)\nAlthough major concerts are now massively expensive, \nsmaller artists\n are finding touring so unsustainable that they are canceling their shows. That the economics of live music are not panning out for them suggests something surprising: Live music \u201cmight be undervalued, really,\u201d Spencer told me.\nConcerts are not the main driver of inflation, of course, but economists are still paying attention to the events\u2019 impact on the wider economy. As I wrote in this \nnewsletter\n a couple of weeks ago, economists in Sweden worried that Beyonc\u00e9\u2019s Renaissance \ntour\n had led to a surge in local prices. Last week, the chief economist of UBS Global Wealth Management published a \nnote\n titled \u201cA Beyonc\u00e9 Price Bounce?\u201d exploring whether her tour had led to a similar phenomenon in the United Kingdom. \u201cFor UK inflation, the pressures may persist,\u201d he concluded.\nIn this odd economic moment, many people are finding that concerts and other experiences are how they want to spend their money. Seeing Taylor sing for more than three hours, or reaching transcendence in Beyonc\u00e9\u2019s mosh pit, may just be worth it to some. \u201cHaving one special night with one particular, highly coveted artist in one space\u2014you can never have it again,\u201d Spencer told me. \u201cLive music is one of the most fleeting and scarce commodities that you can imagine.\u201d\nRelated:\nHow Taylor Swift broke Ticketmaster\nWhy it matters who caused inflation\nToday\u2019s News\nViolent protests over the \nfatal police shooting\n of a 17-year-old in France continued for a second night. Almost 200 people were arrested yesterday evening.\nThe U.S. economy \ngrew 2 percent\n in the first quarter of the year, which was higher than previous estimates.\n\u201cPresumed human remains\u201d \nwere recovered\n from the wreckage of the Titan submersible.\nEvening Read\n \n(Bill Ingalls / NASA / Getty)\n \nScientists Found Ripples in Space and Time.

    "body": "Plus: Stop firing your friends. \nWednesday, June 28, 2023 \n \n \nElaine Godfrey\n \nStaff writer\nThe Supreme Court released a somewhat surprising\u2014and pretty important\u2014decision yesterday. Should it change the way we think about the Court? Before we get into it, here are three new stories from \nThe Atlantic\n:\n \nThe comic strip that explains the evolution of American parenting\nThe new Republican litmus test is very dangerous.\nStop firing your friends.\nConservative, Not MAGA\n \n(Mandel Ngan / AFP via Getty)\n \nView in browser\nIt\u2019s good to be back at The Daily! I spent a lot of time last year writing \nabout\n \ncandidates\n trafficking in election denial. Looming above all of my coverage was a case at the Supreme Court that would determine the future of election law and, by extension, American democracy. That case, \nMoore v. Harper\n, was decided yesterday. I talked with my colleague Russell Berman, a staff writer on our Politics team, about what the decision means, and whether it shifts the dominant narrative about the Roberts Court.\nElaine Godfrey: \nRussell! I\u2019m so glad we get to talk about this. Yesterday was a big SCOTUS day. In a 6\u20133 vote, the Court rejected the independent state legislature theory in a case called \nMoore v. Harper\n. What is that theory\u2014and why were people so anxious about it?\nRussell Berman:\n The theory basically interprets the Constitution as giving near-total authority over elections to state legislatures, over and above state courts, election administrators, secretaries of state, and even governors. What this means in practice is that because Republicans have overwhelming majorities in many of the closest presidential swing states, including Wisconsin, Georgia, and North Carolina, the adoption of this theory by the Supreme Court would have allowed GOP lawmakers in those states to overrule or simply ignore election decisions they didn\u2019t agree with.\nDemocrats believed that Republicans would then have used that power to overturn close elections in 2024, just like former President Donald Trump tried to get his allies to do in 2020.\nElaine: \nThanks to Trump, there were all kinds of Republicans denying the outcome of the 2020 election, as well as sowing doubt ahead of the midterms. A lot of those candidates lost in the midterms, though, including \nKari Lake in Arizona\n. Is this SCOTUS decision the final coda on the election-denial fight? Are we finally done with that stuff now?\nRussell: \nNot so fast, Elaine. As Rick Hasen points out at \nSlate\n, the Supreme Court\u2019s decision doesn\u2019t totally quash the opportunity for election-related shenanigans in the courts. Although the Court declined to give state legislatures unfettered power over elections, it simultaneously warned state courts that \nfederal\n courts\u2014including the Supreme Court\u2014could still overrule them on cases involving federal elections. That\u2019s what happened in \nBush v. Gore\n, when a conservative majority on the Supreme Court essentially decided the 2000 election in favor of George W. Bush. And let\u2019s say that in 2024, the Democratic-controlled state supreme court in Pennsylvania issues a ruling on a big election case in favor of Joe Biden. The Court\u2019s decision today served as a reminder that its members could still have the final say.\nElaine: \nTwo Trump-appointed justices, Brett Kavanaugh and Amy Coney Barrett, joined three liberal justices in the majority decision in this case. That felt surprising to me. Was it to you?\nRussell: \nNot entirely. Although both Kavanaugh and Barrett joined the majority overruling \nRoe v. Wade\n in the \nDobbs\n abortion decision last year, they have not always joined what is now the Court\u2019s far-right wing in election cases: Justices Samuel Alito, Clarence Thomas, and Neil Gorsuch, who all dissented from yesterday\u2019s decision. Kavanaugh voted with the majority earlier this month \nin upholding a key part of the Voting Rights Act\n, while Barrett joined the dissent.\nElaine: \nSo what does this mean for our understanding of the Court at this moment? Is it more liberal-leaning than \nDobbs\n might have suggested?\nRussell: \nIt\u2019s a stretch to call it more liberal. But these decisions suggest that there is a limit to the Court\u2019s rightward shift of the past several years. Chief Justice Roberts in particular continues to resist efforts to upend decades of judicial precedent, and he has had some success in persuading newer justices like Kavanaugh and Barrett to join him. If anything, the Court\u2019s decisions over the past few years suggest it\u2019s conservative but not MAGA. Its ruling in \nDobbs\n was a victory for conservatives, but Trump\u2019s own commitment to the anti-abortion cause \nhas wavered\n. And in addition to this state-legislature ruling, the Court ruled against Trump several times toward the end of his presidency\u2014and, of course, rejected him in his Hail Mary bid to overturn his defeat in 2020.\nElaine: \nSo you\u2019re saying that Democrats shouldn\u2019t start buying \nthose celebrity prayer candles\n with Roberts\u2019s face on them?\nRussell: \nOnly if they also start buying candles with Mitch McConnell\u2019s face on them. Roberts is playing a role similar to the one McConnell has played in the Senate over the past few years. Roberts either wrote or joined several opinions that have been devastating to liberal causes. He\u2019s helped to eviscerate Section 4 of the Voting Rights Act, dramatically expand the scope of the Second Amendment, and limit Congress\u2019s ability to enact campaign-finance regulations. But he\u2019s obviously attuned to public attitudes toward the Court and to that end has tried, with limited success, to restrain the most aggressive impulses of his more ideological colleagues.\nElaine: \nThere are a few other really important cases coming down the pike, including one about college affirmative-action programs and another related to President Joe Biden canceling student debt. If there\u2019s a limit to the Court\u2019s rightward shift, does that tell us anything about how these cases will go? Should progressives plan to be happy?\nRussell:\n Probably not. If the pattern of recent years holds, the relief that progressives are experiencing following their victories in this case and in the voting-rights decision will give way to more anger and disappointment when the Court releases its final opinions of the term. Most legal observers expect the Court to deal a fatal blow to affirmative action after a series of decisions that limited its use in college admissions. And they also believe the Court will rule against President Joe Biden\u2019s effort to unilaterally forgive up to $20,000 in student debt for millions of borrowers.\nRelated:\nThe Roberts Court draws a line.\nThe Court eviscerates the independent state legislature theory.\nToday\u2019s News\nWildfire smoke from Canada has blanketed large portions of the United States, leading more than a dozen states to \nissue air-quality alerts\n.\nFormer President Trump \ncountersued E.

On the other, Spotify has found that the 12 episodes of Markle\u2019s podcast, \nArchetypes\n, were 10 episodes too many (the Serena Williams and Mariah Carey interviews were blockbusters, but after that: \ncrickets\n).

Together, the news stories formed a classic example of the macroeconomic principle of too much, too little, too late.\nIn rapid response to the Netflix needling came word that the couple was working on a possible prequel to \nGreat Expectations\n, centered on the life of a young \nMiss Havisham\n.

    "body": "Plus: The tape of Trump discussing classified documents \nTuesday, June 27, 2023 \n \n \nLora Kelley\n \nAssociate editor\nLast week, Elon Musk and Mark Zuckerberg announced their plans to duke it out in a cage fight. But this potential feud is less important than what it tells us about how Musk is influencing the rules of engagement in Silicon Valley.\nFirst, here are four new stories from \nThe Atlantic\n:\nThe tape of Trump discussing classified documents\nAmerica\u2019s most popular drug has a puzzling side effect. We finally know why.\nGoodbye, Ozempic.\nThe Roberts Court draws a line.\nA Race to the Bottom\n \n(Chesnot / Getty)\n \nView in browser\nSomething strange is happening on Mark Zuckerberg\u2019s Instagram.\nFor years, he posted periodic, classic dad-and-CEO fare: anniversary shots with his wife. Photos of his kids and dog being cute. Meta product announcements.\nIn recent months, though, Zuckerberg has been posting more about fighting. Not the kind that involves firing back at critics on behalf of his oft-embattled social-media empire, but actual mixed-martial-arts training. Earlier this month, he posted a video of himself tussling with a jiujitsu champion. On Memorial Day, he posted himself in a camouflage flak vest, flushed after an intense \narmy workout\n. And last week, Zuckerberg and Elon Musk said they were going to have \na cage fight\n. The men apparently have \nongoing \npersonal tensions, and Meta is working on building a \nTwitter competitor\n. But \nannouncing\n in public their intent to fight takes things to another level.\nIf you rolled your eyes at the cage-fight news: fair enough. The idea of two middle-aged executives, each facing an onslaught of business and public-image problems, literally duking it out is a bit on the nose. But the fight itself\u2014and whether or not it happens\u2014is less important than what it tells us about how Musk is reshaping Silicon Valley. Musk is mainstreaming new standards of behavior, and some of his peers are joining him in misguided acts of masculine aggression and populist appeals.\nLeaders such as Musk and Zuckerberg (and, to some extent, even their less-bombastic but quite buff peer Jeff Bezos) have lately been striving to embody and project a specific flavor of masculine\u2014and political\u2014strength. As my colleague Ian Bogost \nwrote\n last week, \u201cthe nerd-CEO\u2019s mighty body has become an apparatus for securing and extending his power.\u201d\nThe two executives\u2019 cage-fight announcement is \u201ca reflection of a really tight monoculture of Silicon Valley\u2019s most powerful people, most of whom are men,\u201d Margaret O\u2019Mara, a historian at the University of Washington who researches the tech industry, told me. In other words, the would-be participants embody the industry\u2019s bro culture.\nZuckerberg\u2019s recent interest in waging physical battles marks a departure for the CEO, who a few years ago seemed more interested in emulating someone like Bill Gates, an executive who parlayed his entrepreneurial success into philanthropy, O\u2019Mara added. Zuckerberg has been very famous since he was quite young. His early years at the helm of his social-media empire\u2014\u201cI\u2019m CEO, Bitch\u201d \nbusiness cards\n and all\u2014were lightly, and sometimes ungenerously, fictionalized in \nThe Social Network\n by the time he was in his mid-20s. He has consciously curated \nhis image\n in the years since.\nFor a long time, Zuckerberg led Facebook as a \u201cproduct guy,\u201d focusing on the tech while letting Sheryl Sandberg lead the ads business and communications. But overlapping crises\u2014disinformation, Cambridge Analytica, antitrust\u2014after the 2016 election seemingly changed his approach: First, he struck a contrite tone and embarked on a \nlistening tour in 2017\n.The response was not resoundingly positive. By the following summer, he had hardened his image at the company, announcing that he was gearing up to be a \u201c\nwartime\u201d leader\n. He has struck various stances in public over the years, but coming to blows with business rivals has not been among them\u2014yet.\nMusk, meanwhile, has a history of such stunts. At the onset of the war in Ukraine, he \ntweeted\n that he would like to battle Vladimir Putin in single combat, and he apparently has ongoing back pain linked to a past \nfight with a sumo wrestler\n. That Zuckerberg is playing along shows that the rules of engagement have changed.\nMusk has incited a race to the bottom for Silicon Valley leaders. As he becomes more powerful, some\u00a0 \nother executives\n are quietly\u2014and not so quietly\u2014following his lead, cracking down on dissent, slashing jobs, and attempting to wrestle back power from employees. Even as Musk has destabilized Twitter and sparked near-constant controversy in his leadership of the platform, some peers have applauded him. He widened the scope of what CEOs could do, giving observers tacit permission to push boundaries. \u201cHe\u2019s someone who\u2019s willing to do things in public that are transgressing the rules of the game,\u201d O\u2019Mara said.\nDuring the first few months of Musk\u2019s Twitter reign, few executives were willing to praise him on the record\u2014though Reed Hastings, then a co-CEO of Netflix, did \ncall\n Musk \u201cthe bravest, most creative person on the planet\u201d in November. A few months later, Marc Benioff, the CEO of Salesforce, \ntold \nInsider\n that executives around Silicon Valley have been asking, \u201cDo they need to unleash their own Elon within them?\u201d \nThe Washington Post\n reported this past Saturday that Zuckerberg was undergoing an \u201c\nElonization\n\u201d as he attempts to appeal to Musk\u2019s base, the proposed cage fight being the latest event in his rebrand. (Facebook declined to comment. A request for comment to Twitter\u2019s press email was returned with a poop emoji auto-responder.)\nWhether or when the cage match will actually happen is unclear. Musk\u2019s mother, for her part, has \nlobbied against it\n.

    "subject": "Putin is caught in his own trap",
    "body": "Plus: The first MAGA Democrat \nMonday, June 26, 2023 \n \n \nIsabel Fattal\n \nSenior editor\n\u201cA short recap of the past 24 hours in Russia reads like the backstory for a fanciful episode of \nMadam Secretary \nor \nThe West Wing\n,\u201d my colleague Tom Nichols wrote yesterday.\n \nToday\u2019s newsletter will walk you through our writers\u2019 most urgent and clarifying analysis on the whirlwind events of the past weekend.\nFirst, here are three new stories from \nThe Atlantic\n:\nThe first MAGA Democrat\nDear Therapist: I\u2019ve been dumped by my friends.\nThe battle for I-95\nA Permanent Scar\n \n(Getty)\n \nView in browser\nThis past Saturday morning, Yevgeny Prigozhin, a convicted criminal who leads the Wagner mercenary group, declared war on the Russian Ministry of Defense. After advancing hundreds of miles toward the capital, Prigozhin announced that a deal had been struck and that his forces were turning back around.\nAs \nAtlantic\n writers reminded us throughout the weekend, Prigozhin\u2019s brief coup was and remains a fast-moving story, and following it requires disentangling complex webs of disinformation. Below is some of our writers\u2019 most useful analysis to help you put Russia\u2019s crisis in context.\nThe coup is over, but Putin is in trouble.\n\u201cWe can at this point only speculate about why Prigozhin undertook this putsch, and why it all failed so quickly,\u201d Tom \nwrote\n on Saturday, but \u201cthis bizarre episode is not a win for Putin.\u201d Tom explains:\nThe Russian dictator has been visibly wounded, and he will now bear the permanent scar of political vulnerability. Instead of looking like a decisive autocrat (or even just a mob boss in command of his crew), Putin left Moscow after issuing a short video in which he was visibly angry and off his usual self-assured game.\nAs for Prigozhin, the Wagner Group leader \u201cdrew blood and then walked away from a man who never, ever lets such a personal offense go unavenged. But Putin may have had no choice, which is yet another sign of his precarious situation,\u201d Tom writes.\nThe Russian president is caught in his own trap.\nOur staff writer Anne Applebaum \nsuggests\n paying attention to the reactions of the Russian people. When the Wagner Group mercenaries arrived in the city of Rostov-on-Don on Saturday morning and declared themselves the new rulers, \u201cthey met no resistance,\u201d Anne reported. \u201cOne \nphotograph\n, published by \nThe New York Times\n, shows them walking at a leisurely pace across a street, one of their tanks in the background, holding yellow coffee cups.\u201d She goes on:\nThis was the most remarkable aspect of the whole day: Nobody seemed to mind, particularly, that a brutal new warlord had arrived to replace the existing regime\u2014not the security services, not the army, and not the general public. On the contrary, many seemed sorry to see him go.\nTo understand this response, Anne explains, observers must reckon with the power of apathy. \u201cA certain kind of autocrat, of whom Putin is the outstanding example, seeks to convince people of the opposite: not to participate, not to care, and not to follow politics at all.\u201d Through a constant barrage of propaganda, Putin convinces Russian citizens that there is no truth to be found. And if nothing is true, then why protest or engage in politics?\nBut apathy works both ways: \u201cIf no one cares about anything, that means they don\u2019t care about their supreme leader, his ideology, or his war,\u201d Anne explains. \u201cRussians haven\u2019t flocked to sign up to fight in Ukraine. They haven\u2019t rallied around the troops in Ukraine or held emotive ceremonies marking either their successes or their deaths. Of course they haven\u2019t organized to oppose the war, but they haven\u2019t organized to support it either.\u201d\nWhy did Prigozhin\u2019s coup fail?\nBrian Klaas, who has studied coups around the world, \noffered\n some lessons from the history of such uprisings. The most successful coups are those run by a unified military, Klaas writes. \u201cIn Thailand, for example, coups are usually executed by the military brass, who announce that they are toppling civilian politicians. With nobody with guns to oppose them, Thai coups almost always succeed \u2026 After all, what\u2019s the president or prime minister going to do\u2014shoot back at the army?\u201d\nIn Russia, however, the coup was carried out by a faction connected to the country\u2019s military sector. In those cases, \u201cthe plot will likely succeed less on strength than on perception.

    "body": "Entertainment musts from Franklin Foer \nSunday, June 25, 2023 \n \nGood morning. Before we turn to the Sunday culture edition of this newsletter, here are some of our writers\u2019 most recent stories to help you make sense of the situation in Russia.\nWhy didn\u2019t the Wagner coup succeed?\nPrigozhin planned this.\nThe coup is over, but Putin is in trouble.\n \nIsabel Fattal\n \nSenior editor\nWelcome back to The Daily\u2019s Sunday culture edition, in which one \nAtlantic\n writer reveals what\u2019s keeping them entertained.\nToday\u2019s special guest is \nAtlantic\n staff writer Franklin Foer. Frank is currently at work on a \nbook\n about the first two years of the Biden presidency; he has recently written for \nThe Atlantic \nabout \ncontroversies in the book world\n and \nthe act of psychoanalyzing American presidents\n. He\u2019s currently reliving a transcendent music experience he shared with his daughter, wishing he could find a TV show as good as \nSuccession\n\u2014especially in the art of \u201csibling razzing\u201d\u2014and watching Bill Nighy any time he graces the screen.\nFirst, here are three Sunday reads from \nThe Atlantic\n:\nGo ahead, try to explain milk.\nThe ghost of a once era-defining show\nHow the vape shops won\nThe Culture Survey: Frank Foer\n \nView in browser\nSomething delightful introduced to me by a kid in my life:\n When my oldest daughter was 3, I made a determined effort to teach her how to eat with a fork and knife, culturally speaking. I bought used VHS copies of one of the most improbable shows in the history of network television, \nYoung Person\u2019s Guide to the Orchestra\n, in which a dashing Leonard Bernstein sweeps the hair from his face as he attempts to explain classical music to a CBS audience in the 1960s. For nearly two whole minutes, I managed to coerce her to sit on the couch with me in front of the black-and-white broadcast. Then she broke free and changed the channel to \nThe\n \nBackyardigans\n.\nI thought about this doomed experiment in parental pedantry recently because my daughter is now 18. A few weeks back, she graduated from high school, and she\u2019s off to college in the fall. Just before the beginning of her second semester of senior year, we vowed (or was I coercing her again?) to watch every movie on the newly released \nSight and Sound\n \nlist\n of all-time greatest films. We were going to start with Chantal Akerman\u2019s \nJeanne Dielman\n, the surprise at the top of the rankings. A family member dismissed the project as hopelessly pretentious, and sure enough, this plan didn\u2019t fare any better with my daughter than my attempt to foist Bernstein on her.\nBut one of the joys of her teenage years has been our cultural convergence. Because she\u2019s an enthusiast for gardening, a couple of months back, we jointly curated a Spotify playlist of songs about plants, which happens to be a ubiquitous musical metaphor.\nDuring her senior year, we started going to concerts together for acts we both liked\u2014to Big Thief and Phoebe Bridgers, to see a group from New Zealand called The Beths. (\nExpert in a Dying Field\n is the impeccable title of The Beths\u2019 most recent album.) For Chanukah, she bought us tickets for a brassy Brooklyn group called Rubblebucket. I had barely heard of it. But attending the concert was one of the great musical experiences of my life. The band was exuberant\u2014horns blaring, lead singer pushing her anaerobic capacity with manic dancing\u2014and so were we.\nIn their book, \nAll Things Shining\n, the philosophers Hubert Dreyfus and Sean Dorrance Kelly argue that the transformative reading of Western classics\u2014and moments of passionate engagement with culture\u2014can help us rediscover purpose in a secular society, because it can supply a similar sensation of transcendence. (It\u2019s a lovely short read.) They would call the experience of culturally induced sublimation \u201cwhooshing up.\u201d At the 9:30 Club, with a band I barely knew, my daughter and I were, in fact, whooshing up. Because I knew that moment of fatherhood was so fleeting, it felt genuinely ecstatic.\nThe culture or entertainment product my friends are talking about most right now:\n I find it annoying how many conversations return to the inadequacy of television after \nSuccession\n. They are annoying because they are true. Every suggestion for a replacement is impoverished by comparison.\nLike many couples, my wife and I will frequently watch shows on our devices at our own pace. (Yes, it\u2019s a mark of my selfishness\u2014and my inability to pass the marshmallow test\u2014that I annoyingly race ahead.) She\u2019s still making her way through Season 4. I\u2019m rewatching episodes with her just so I can study the poetry of familial teasing. It takes characters uninhibited by superegos and morality to realize the literary heights of the sibling-razzing genre.\n [\nRelated: The \nSuccession\n plot point that explained the whole series\n]\nAn actor I would watch in anything:\n Bill Nighy. I would even watch him as a catatonic English civil servant confronting his own mortality. That\u2019s the conceit of \nLiving\n, which just began streaming on Netflix. Kazuo Ishiguro wrote the screenplay, which is an adaptation of a Kurosawa film, which is an adaptation of a Tolstoy novella. The movie is borderline sappy but saved by its Englishness. In moments of catharsis, it pulls back just enough to stay classy, unable to fully express its emotions.\nIt\u2019s disturbing to see Nighy play a character so old and inhibited, because he\u2019s a balletic actor, usually bursting with charm. I love to watch him walk across the screen. He packs a Russian novel\u2019s worth of character into his gait.\nI\u2019m an evangelist for his turn in the \nWorricker Trilogy\n, a series of BBC thrillers written by David Hare. The series is about the War on Terror. Nighy is a rogue MI5 agent who seeks to undermine the power-mad Tony Blair\u2013like prime minister, played by Ralph Fiennes. For whatever reason, nobody seems to have ever heard about this miniseries, but it\u2019s sitting there on Apple TV.\n [\nRelated: The movie that helped Kazuo Ishiguro make sense of the world\n]\nSomething I recently rewatched, reread, or otherwise revisited:\n After Martin Amis\u2019s death, I picked up a copy of his \u201c\nnovelized autobiography\n,\u201d \nInside Story\n, that was lying in the middle of a pile in the bedroom. It\u2019s a book very much about mortality\u2014that of his friends (Christopher Hitchens and Saul Bellow) and his own. Reviewing the book in \nThe Atlantic\n, my colleague \nJames Parker wrote\n, \u201cHe wants to lance the moment with language, and he wants his language to live forever.\u201d Reading Amis\u2019s own farewell, at the book\u2019s end, it\u2019s impossible to believe that it won\u2019t. \n[\nRelated: Jennifer Egan: I learned how to be funny from Martin Amis.\n]\nMy favorite way of wasting time on my phone:\n Searching for rumors about which players Arsenal Football Club might buy this summer.\nThe arts/culture/entertainment event I\u2019m most looking forward to:\n I can\u2019t wait to see the postponed Philip Guston exhibit at the National Gallery.

    "body": "Plus: The nerds are bullies now. \nFriday, June 23, 2023 \n \n \nIsabel Fattal\n \nSenior Editor\nToday, the hosts of our podcast \nHow to Talk to People\n offer advice on making small talk, finding connection, and prioritizing friendships in a world that doesn\u2019t always put non-romantic relationships first.\nFirst, here are four new stories from \nThe Atlantic\n:\nHas COVID\u2019s patient zero finally been named?\nThe elegant, utterly original comedy of Alex Edelman\nThe nerds are bullies now.\nIndia is not Modi, we once said. I wish I still believed it.\nAdvice, Not Homework\n \n(The Atlantic)\n \nView in browser\nThe title of the most recent season of\n The Atlantic\n\u2019s \nHow To\n podcast, \nHow to Talk to People\n,\n \nwas sort of a joke\u2014but not entirely, the podcast\u2019s host, Julie Beck, and its producer, Rebecca Rashid, told me recently. Talking to people is not as easy as it might sound. For instance: How does a person make small talk without fainting from awkwardness? And how can we expand our social connections in a society that\u2019s not exactly built for meeting new people? I chatted with Julie and Becca about this season of the podcast, which wraps up next week, and about the value of focusing on the human relationships that tend to get ignored.\nIsabel Fattal: \nHave either of you taken any advice from the podcast back to your own life? Have you met an acquaintance on a train and said, \n\u201cIt\u2019s been so great talking to you. I\u2019m going to go read my book now\u201d\n?\nJulie Beck:\n \nI have not been brave enough to use that line yet, but I also don\u2019t know if the situation has arisen. I definitely feel out of my body when I\u2019m doing small talk sometimes now. I have the meta commentary of, \nAm I doing a good job?\nBecca Rashid:\n I\u2019ve learned from the show more about boundaries for people who \ndon\u2019t\n always want to be spoken to. I\u2019m the person striking up a conversation with everyone\u2014at caf\u00e9s I work at, the bus driver, anyone I see consistently enough.\nJulie:\n You took us to your favorite boba shop, and as we walked in, they were like, \u201cBecca!\u201d\nWhen I think about what I\u2019ve learned, it\u2019s less about me changing my habits than just thinking about community a little bit differently. I'm always beating myself up for not reaching out enough or not doing X, Y, or Z. I tend to think, \nIf I was just more diligent and better and did all of these things, then we would have a beautiful, interconnected, happy community utopia\n. I\u2019ve learned about balancing the reality of life and people\u2019s different needs and competing priorities. Not everyone is going to have the same priorities as you, and that\u2019s fine. I\u2019ve learned to notice what you have and be grateful for that, and not always try to optimize every facet of how you approach your relationships.\nIsabel:\n I love that, because I think, in our self-help-focused era, you can listen to a podcast like this and think, \nOh, this podcast is going to help me optimize every moment of my life\n. It\u2019s good to remind ourselves that\u2019s not the point.\nJulie:\n Right. We want to give you advice, but we don\u2019t want to give you homework.\nIsabel:\n Julie, after conducting 100 interviews with groups of friends for your \u201c\nFriendship Files\n\u201d series, you landed on \nthe six forces that fuel friendship\n. Has this podcast changed your view of those six forces at all?\nJulie:\n \nI do think all six forces came across in a lot of these conversations\u2014particularly \nintention\n, being deliberate and putting effort in, and also \ngrace\n, which I think is what we were just talking about in terms of \u201c\ns\ntop optimizing.\u201d One question I had for myself is whether \nobligation\n should be added. I think that word has a really negative connotation: It\u2019s something that you don\u2019t \nwant\n to do, something you are burdened by. But that was a big thread of conversation throughout this podcast, about how so much of friendship culture in America is designed around \nnot\n putting obligations on one another.\nI don\u2019t think we ever used this, because I felt\u2014and continue to feel, even in this moment\u2014like a cheeseball, pretentious person.\n \nBut there is a C. S. Lewis quote I really love\u2014he wrote a letter to his friend after his wife died, and reflected on having a lot of free time he wished he didn\u2019t have. He wrote, \u201cOne doesn\u2019t realise in early life that the price of freedom is loneliness. To be happy one must be tied.\u201d\nI don\u2019t actually think of all obligations as a bad thing. In some ways, the commitments that we make to our friends and our neighbors fuel our happiness.\nIsabel:\n Is there anything else you were hoping to discuss that we didn\u2019t get to?\nJulie:\n Just that Becca and I really became friends while we made the podcast.\nBecca: \nI\u2019m a big \u201cfood is my love language\u201d person. Julie has brought me food at work, but she\u2019s also brought food to my house. I think that was the moment I realized we were true friends, Julie. For me, it was the reception of the food.\nRelated:\nHow to make small talk \nThe six forces that fuel friendship\nListen to the full \nHow to Talk to People\n series here.\nToday\u2019s News\nThe Supreme Court \nruled in favor\n of the Biden administration\u2019s immigration-enforcement guidelines, which prioritize the arrest of undocumented people who have serious criminal records, are deemed threats to national security, or recently crossed the border.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\nStarbucks workers in Seattle \nlaunched a strike\n, alleging that Pride-month decorations are being banned in some stores, which Starbucks has denied.

    "body": "Plus: How the vape shops won \nThursday, June 22, 2023 \n \n \nLora Kelley\n \nAssociate editor\nAn expedition to see the remains of the Titanic turned into a tragedy. How did it go so wrong?\nFirst, here are four new stories from \nThe Atlantic\n:\nWhy not Whitmer?\nThe ghost of a once era-defining show\nHow the vape shops won\nGo ahead, try to explain milk.\nLost Contact\n \nRescue teams on a search for the tourist submersible with five people on board, in Boston, Massachusetts, on June 21 \n(Fatih Aktas / Anadolu Agency via Getty)\n \nView in browser\nThe Titan, a submersible vessel carrying passengers to see the ruins of the Titanic, lost contact with its support ship during a dive on Sunday. The ensuing search-and-rescue mission in the Atlantic Ocean covered some 10,000 square miles. This afternoon, OceanGate Expeditions, the tourism and research company running the voyage, \nannounced\n that it believed that all of the passengers \u201chave sadly been lost.\u201d The U.S. Coast Guard said soon after that debris from the vessel had been found on the ocean floor, about \n1,600 feet\n from the bow of the Titanic.\nThe search-and-rescue effort had become a race against the clock, as the vessel \nwas believed to have\n had about four days\u2019 worth of oxygen on board. Five people were on the expedition: Stockton Rush, OceanGate\u2019s chief executive; Hamish Harding, a British businessman and explorer; Paul-Henri Nargeolet, who had traveled to the Titanic site more than 35 times; Shahzada Dawood, a British-Pakistani businessman; and Suleman Dawood, Shahzada\u2019s 19-year-old son. Suleman was a business student in Glasgow.\nOver the past week, alarming reports about the vessel have emerged. As my colleague Marina Koren wrote in a story today about the tragic ending to Sunday\u2019s expedition:\nMost concerning of all, it is not clear whether the Titan was inspected for safety by outside experts. In 2018, dozens of industry experts \nwarned\n OceanGate that if the company didn\u2019t put the Titan through an independent safety assessment, its Titanic expeditions could face potentially \u201ccatastrophic\u201d problems. Even OceanGate\u2019s own director of marine operations was at the time worried about \u201cthe potential dangers to passengers of the Titan as the submersible reached extreme depths,\u201d \nThe New York Times\n \nreported\n this week. At least one previous dive had problems too: According to \nPogue\n, a Titan expedition last year got lost on the seafloor for about five hours.\nAlthough officials don\u2019t know what caused the disaster or what regulations might have prevented it, OceanGate\u2019s \nleaders\n have argued in the past that innovation can be at odds with safety regulations. In a 2019 blog post, the company wrote, \u201cBringing an outside entity up to speed on every innovation before it is put into real-world testing is anathema to rapid innovation.\u201d (OceanGate did not respond to a request for comment about safety concerns regarding the Titan.)\nAs Marina noted today, the space-tourism industry often draws attention to the safety measures of its craft\u2014at least in public. (What the companies do in private is another story, she reminds us.) But by comparison, \u201cOceanGate\u2019s public approach to safety seems almost cavalier, less like modern-day space tourism and more reminiscent of the rushed and occasionally ramshackle efforts of the space race,\u201d she writes. In the 2018 open letter from industry experts, more than three dozen people, including oceanographers and industry experts, warned that the company\u2019s \u201cexperimental\u201d approach \u201cwould have serious consequences for everyone in the industry.\u201d\nWhat those consequences might be remains to be seen. At the news conference earlier today, John Mauger, a rear admiral of the U.S. Coast Guard, acknowledged that many questions linger about how, when, and why this happened. \u201cThat\u2019s going to be, I\u2019m sure, the focus of future review,\u201d he said. \u201cRight now, we\u2019re focused on documenting the scene.\u201d\nRelated\n:\nThe Titanic sub and the draw of extreme tourism\nHow could this have happened?\nToday\u2019s News\nIndian Prime Minister Narendra Modi is meeting with President Joe Biden for a state visit to \ndiscuss new partnerships\n between the two countries.\nThe \nWall Street Journal\n reporter Evan Gershkovich, who has been detained by Russian officials on espionage charges that he denies, \nlost his appeal\n against pretrial detention.\nTropical Storm Bret is \nnearing the eastern Caribbean\n, moving at just below the speeds of a Category 1 hurricane.\nDispatches\nUp for Debate\n: Conor Friedersdorf reflects on \nJoe Rogan, RFK Jr., and the public debates worth having\n.\nExplore all of our newsletters here.\nEvening Read\n \n(Courtesy of MGM)\n \nThe Valley Girl, Like, Totally Deserved Better\n \nBy\n \nSoraya Roberts\n \n\u201cShe got a whole bunch of nothing in there,\u201d Frank Zappa sings in \u201cValley Girl,\u201d his 1982 novelty tune and the original source for a certain Southern Californian, well-to-do, teen-bimbo stereotype. Zappa, known for his satirical, experimental compositions, had been inspired to record the song with his kid, who imitated her private-school classmates on the recording. Referring to the region most associated with this vacuous figure, Zappa told David Letterman, \u201cIt\u2019s perhaps one of the most disgusting places on the face of the Earth, and I wrote this song about the values of the people in the San Fernando Valley.\u201d Such scorn remains a common reaction to the Valley-girl archetype. She no longer has to live in California or even be an adolescent, but she still represents a particular kind of frivolous suburbanite encouraged by a consumer society to do little more than shop, party, and tan. Other examples include Cher from \nClueless\n, Elle from \nLegally Blonde\n, the Kardashians, and any number of Real Housewives. Yet the Valley girl has always been an overly easy target\u2014and one film, released shortly after the Zappa single, understood that.\nRead the full article. \nMore From \nThe Atlantic\nSan Antonio, the Spurs, and me\nGenerative AI should not replace thinking at my university.\nCulture Break\n \n(FX)\n \nListen.\n Are we just too impatient for baseball?

    "subject": "What the Reddit protests are really about",
    "body": "Plus: Trump seems to be afraid, very afraid. \nWednesday, June 21, 2023 \n \n \nLora Kelley\n \nAssociate Editor\nFor more than a week now, Reddit moderators have been using the site\u2019s tools to protest proposed business changes. The stalemate reveals how much power the site\u2019s users have accumulated over the years\u2014and just how much the site depends on its moderators\u2019 free labor.\nFirst, here are three new stories from \nThe Atlantic:\nTrump seems to be afraid, very afraid.\nPixar\u2019s talking blobs are becoming more and more unsatisfying.\nThe Titanic sub and the draw of extreme tourism\nNot a Worker, Not a Customer\n \n(Rafael Henrique / LightRocket / Getty)\n \nView in browser\nIf you\u2019re looking for pictures of John Oliver, for some reason, I have a recommendation for you: The Reddit group r/pics. For the past several days, the r/pics forum, normally populated with food pictures and nature shots, has featured a steady drumbeat of photos of the comedian: John Oliver with his wife. John Oliver\u2019s face Photoshopped onto Spider-Man\u2019s body. John Oliver at a desk. John Oliver on his show. Indeed, the group\u2019s moderators have forbidden users from posting anything besides John Oliver photos.\nThis is more than just a fun stunt (though it is pretty fun for observers). It is one of the various creative ways that Reddit moderators have used their authority in recent days to register discontent with proposed changes to Reddit\u2019s business.\nFor the past 10 days, moderators of thousands of Reddit forums have been protesting the company\u2019s plans to charge third parties to run apps on the site. Last week, nearly 9,000 forums went dark for 48 hours. Some forums \nremain shut down\n this week, and others are continuing to disrupt the normal flow of posts through the pipelines of the platform.\nThe trouble began after, earlier this spring, Reddit said it would start charging some other companies for Application Programming Interface (or API) access. In April, the company \nframed upcoming changes\n as an effort to ensure that it would be compensated when AI companies scraped the site\u2019s reams of user-generated content. \nMore recently\n, changes have meant that some \nbeloved apps\n that make the site easier to use will be forced to shut down because of prohibitive expenses.\nReddit moderators can be forgiven for resenting changes that might make their lives harder. After all, they do a significant amount of work for free. Reddit\u2019s users, especially power users such as moderators, contribute in a big way to the quality and growth of the platform. They lead and nurture (and police) communities that gather around various interests, such as \nrelationships\n, parenting, plumbing, or weighing in on whether, in a given situation, a poster is \nthe asshole\n. The relationship between Reddit and its users is unique. The company places outsize responsibility on its volunteer moderators, but as a result, they also have outsize power\u2014which means that their coordinated actions can cause much disruption on the platform.\nModerators are not paid employees of the site. But they are not always customers, either\u2014though Reddit has a \npremium tier\n, many users don\u2019t pay to use the platform. Reddit, like many tech companies that provide free products, runs ads (cue the adage \u201cIf you\u2019re not paying for the product, you are the product\u201d). Now, with its new rules, the company is attempting to monetize the content that users\u2014and particularly moderators\u2014have been generating for free.\nBy protesting the changes, moderators are reminding Reddit just how much the site needs them\u2014and how much the moderators need third-party tools. \u201cMany Reddit moderators rely on third-party apps in order to do their jobs,\u201d my colleague Kaitlyn Tiffany, who reports on internet culture for \nThe Atlantic\n and recently wrote a great book about online communities and fandom, reminded me this morning. \u201cWithout them, they\u2019re rightfully concerned that their forums will be flooded with garbage.\u201d\nThe API debate has exposed broader fault lines on the site, Fraser Raeburn, a historian and Reddit moderator, told me. He said that Reddit should better acknowledge \u201cthe role volunteers play within it, in terms of curating content and keeping Reddit a relatively safe and functional part of the internet.\u201d The moderators of his forum, r/AskHistorians, have restricted posts on their forum as part of the protest. Raeburn said he hopes to see Reddit\u2019s leaders engage constructively with questions and clarify how they will handle the disruptions that come from losing some add-ons.\nSo far, things have been fractious. Reddit CEO Steve Huffman \ntold NBC\n last week that moderators were like \u201clanded gentry,\u201d and suggested that he might make changes that would allow users to vote moderators out. (When I asked Reddit for comment on the recent protests, I was directed to a \nblog post\n from last week on the API updates.) For now, moderators remain powerful.\nModerated communities are what have made Reddit distinctive as a platform, and as a result, helped it last. As Kaitlyn pointed out, \u201cReddit\u2019s model of empowering moderators has given the site a much longer shelf life than I think many would have thought possible 10 years ago.\u201d\nIt\u2019s not easy for a tech company to make a lot of money and make all of its users happy\u2014especially on a platform that has an open-source ethos. For all the talk among VCs and techies about the power of community, Reddit is demonstrating how fraught the community-based model can be. Especially as Reddit eyes a \npotential IPO\n, its corporate interests and user needs may clash.\nRaeburn told me he wants this resolved so that he can get back to the reason he\u2019s on the site: talking about history. But for now, he marvels at the way that the site\u2019s structure and culture made this type of action possible. \u201cReddit had to give us a degree of control over the site because they wanted us to do that work for them,\u201d Raeburn said. \u201cReddit, probably inadvertently, has created the structure for protest to succeed.\u201d\nRelated:\nReddit is finally facing its legacy of racism.\nInside r/relationships, the unbearably human corner of Reddit\nToday\u2019s News\nA \nProPublica report\n revealed that Supreme Court Justice Samuel Alito had \nfailed to disclose\n a 2008 luxury fishing trip with a wealthy conservative donor. Alito wrote \nan op-ed\n defending himself in \nThe Wall Street Journal\n.\nPresident Joe Biden \nreferred to Xi Jinping\n as a dictator at a campaign event in California.\nThe Federal Reserve is \nlikely to raise\n interest rates in the coming months, despite holding them steady last week.\nDispatches\nUp for Debate\n:\n Readers reflect on how media portrayals can sometimes \nbe at odds\n with their own life experiences.\nThe Weekly Planet\n:\n Car-rental companies are ruining EVs, \nSaahil Desai writes\n.

Sources: Bureau of Indian Affairs; Jamestown S\u2019Klallam Tribe / Tribal Museum.)\n \nBlood-Quantum Laws Are Splintering My Tribe\n \nBy\n \nLeah Myers\n \nEven though I am a citizen of the Jamestown S\u2019Klallam Tribe, because of my blood I may also be the last tribal member in my family line.\nMy tribe requires that members be at least one-eighth Jamestown S'Klallam by blood. Because I am exactly one-eighth, unless I have kids with another citizen, my kids will be ineligible to join. Regulations like this, known as blood-quantum laws, are used by many tribal nations to determine citizenship. They do this in the name of preservation, fearing that diluting the bloodline could mean diluting the culture. However, by enforcing these laws, tribal governments not only exclude some active members of their communities, but also may be creating a future in which fewer and fewer people will be eligible for citizenship.

    "subject": "Putin talks tough while Ukraine makes gains",
    "body": "Plus: the woman who bought a mountain for God \nTuesday, June 20, 2023 \n \n \nTom Nichols\n \nStaff writer\nThe Ukrainians are making progress in their long-awaited counteroffensive. Meanwhile, the Russian president is talking like a gangster and rattling the nuclear saber\u2014again.\nFirst, here are three new stories from \nThe Atlantic\n:\nThe woman who bought a mountain for God\nJustice comes for Hunter Biden.\nThe failure of affirmative action\nA Slow, Bloody Business\n \nView in browser\nWhile we\u2019re all distracted\u2014understandably\u2014by the \nspectacle\n of a former U.S. president under multiple criminal indictments, the war in Europe grinds on, consuming lives, burning cities, and threatening global peace. The Ukrainian counteroffensive is \nnow clearly under way\n, and Kyiv\u2019s forces are making incremental but concrete gains along the front. The Ukrainians are, for the moment, calm and confident; the Russians less so.\nUkrainian officials have been \ncautious in their evaluations\n of this early stage of the counteroffensive because they know it\u2019s going to be a long summer. \u201cHot battles continue,\u201d according to a statement from Deputy Defense Minister Hanna Maliar, and the situation is \u201cdifficult.\u201d Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky has acknowledged Russian counterattacks but \nsaid yesterday\n that no positions have been lost, while other areas have been \u201cliberated.\u201d\nRussian President Vladimir Putin, however, is talking tough\u2014which itself is a tell, a sign of how he thinks this war is going.\nPutin is trying to turn up the global temperature with some swagger about nuclear weapons. This past March, \nPutin said\n that he would base Russian nuclear weapons \nin Belarus\n, close to Ukraine. Moscow and Minsk have since \nsigned a formal agreement\n, and Putin \nnow claims\n that the first weapons have arrived in Belarus. This may or may not be true; Putin has \npreviously said\n that storage facilities for Russian warheads wouldn\u2019t be ready until July, and the Russian military is not exactly known for getting things done ahead of time, so it\u2019s unclear how much of this is (at this point) mere bluster. U.S. Secretary of State Antony Blinken \nsaid\n a few days ago that the United States does not \u201csee any indications that Russia is preparing to use a nuclear weapon\u201d\u2014which isn\u2019t quite the same thing as saying that the weapons haven\u2019t moved\u2014but also that America has \u201cno reason to adjust our own nuclear posture.\u201d\nPutin, meanwhile, \nsaid\n at the St. Petersburg International Economic Forum last week that he had no interest in returning to any conversations with the West about arms control. \u201cWe have more of these weapons than NATO countries do,\u201d he said in answer to an interviewer\u2019s question. \u201cThey know that, and they keep telling us to start negotiations on reductions. Well, you know, fuck \u2019em. As our people would say.\u201d\nCNN \ntried\n to render this Russian expression\u2014\n\u0445\u0440\u0435\u043d \u0438\u043c\n\u2014more gently, as \u201cshove it,\u201d but that\u2019s not even close. Putin has often used this kind of gangsterish tone when he\u2019s trying to project strength, especially to his own people in Russia. (He \nused\n similarly rough language, much to the Russian public\u2019s delight, when speaking of what he would to do to Chechen terrorists, using a phrase that, in American Mob idiom, would basically translate as a vow \u201cto whack them in their shithouses.\u201d)\nThe leader of a nuclear-armed power sounding like Tony Soprano is alarming, but Putin is likely emphasizing Russia\u2019s nuclear deterrent because his conventional forces have been repeatedly humiliated in combat. More to the point, although Russia still has a large military, Moscow has lost its best units and most highly trained officers and soldiers after a year of ghastly losses on the ground.\nSo what should we expect, and how should we think about this new phase in the war?\nFirst, Americans especially should put aside what they know about recent U.S.-led wars such as the campaigns in Iraq: There will be no gathering on a \u201cline of departure\u201d followed by a massive air, armor, and infantry blitz. Nor is this like D-Day, with men storming the beaches and overwhelming enemy pillboxes. The counteroffensive had no real \u201cbeginning,\u201d in that sense; the initial phase probably began with some tentative engagements against the Russians on the edges of Bakhmut shortly after Putin\u2019s forces \nfinally took what\u2019s left\n of the town a few weeks ago.\nSadly, the Ukraine war is now more like World War I: Both sides have settled in along a large, static line. The Russian high command has been dreading this Ukrainian counteroffensive since last winter, and so \nthe Russians have dug in\n, taking up defense positions inside fortifications and huddling in trenches that will have to be cleared out one by one. (The Ukrainians have already released footage of their soldiers fighting in Russian trenches.) The Ukrainians must now probe, feint, and strike where they can, while trying to attack and disrupt Russian supply and reinforcements waiting in the rear, farther back from the battlefield.\nSecond, there will be no official \u201cend\u201d to the counteroffensive, either. (Well, unless Russia sues for peace, I suppose, but Putin has no apparent interest in any of that.) War is an uncertain and contingent thing; as we teach students at our senior military colleges, the enemy gets a vote on your strategy. Luck always gets a say as well. Americans are used to conflicts in which the United States deploys a large force, seizes the initiative, and keeps it for as long as we wish. The Ukrainians have no such luxury.\nAlthough we should keep an eye on those Russian nukes (and whether Putin is really moving them), the real news in the coming weeks will be whether the Ukrainians can break through points along those Russian lines. The Russians are already engaging in savage counterattacks in an effort to blunt Ukrainian operations, and although sudden collapses and dramatic wins and losses on either side are always possible, the more likely story is one of Ukrainian progress measured by the names of small villages and the coordinates of grid squares on a map\u2014a slower and far bloodier business.\nAs for Putin\u2019s threats, the Russian president seems to be venting and showing off, which is one way to know that we are not yet in a crisis. When national leaders \nstop\n appearing in public, and both Moscow and Washington go quiet, \nthat\u2019s \na time to worry. Putin is indulging his usual vulgar sense of humor, and though Americans, like Russians, also have some colorful local expressions, it is better for the Americans and NATO to be the resolute adults in the room, as they have been since the beginning of this criminal Russian onslaught.\nRelated:\nThe true purpose of Ukraine\u2019s counteroffensive\nWhat happens if Russia stashes nukes in Belarus\nToday\u2019s News\nRescue crews are \ncontinuing the search\n for a submersible with five people aboard that went missing while traveling to tour the Titanic\u2019s wreckage.

Truman is a brand in a setting that is stridently generic. Since his birth, he has navigated a world manufactured\u2014by Christof, the creator of his show\u2014for lucrative inoffensiveness. Everything around him exists to fulfill the primary mandate of a mass-market TV show: appealing to the widest possible audience.\nThe Truman Show\n hits a snag, though, and the problem is Truman. As he grows up, he proves himself to be less a bland everyman than someone who is quirky and restless and, in the best way, kind of a weirdo. Truman is also unusually inquisitive\u2014a great quality for anyone who is not a piece of IP. Christof, consequently, has spent much of the show\u2019s run trying to squelch Truman\u2019s curiosity. He wants to be an explorer, an excited Truman tells a teacher. \u201cYou\u2019re too late,\u201d she replies, on cue. \u201cThere\u2019s really nothing left to explore.\u201d\nRead the full article. \nMore From \nThe Atlantic\nWhat we learned from autism\u2019s first child\nApple is an AI company now.\nThe feminists insisting that women are built differently\nThe bitter truth about the Bud Light boycott\nCulture Break\n \n(Illustration by The Atlantic*)\n \nRead.\n Robert Gottlieb, who edited Toni Morrison, Robert Caro, and others, died last week at 92.

But I have long been fascinated by how nuclear arms and fears of nuclear war seeped so deeply into our popular culture during the Cold War. (In fact, I used to teach a course about it at Harvard Extension School.) So if you\u2019re looking for a little light music to accompany your reading about nuclear issues\u2014such as this \narticle\n by me last year and another \nhere\n by my colleague Ross Andersen\u2014I \nhave a playlist\n for you.\nThis list won\u2019t include all your sentimental favorites\u2014sorry, fans of \u201c99 Red Balloons\u201d; we\u2019ve heard that one enough\u2014but there\u2019s some odd stuff here: Did you know that Bill Haley\u2019s \u201cRock Around the Clock\u201d was actually the \nflip side\n of a single about a nuclear war that leaves only one man and 13 women alive? (Bill sounds pretty happy about it.) And there are songs that even I didn\u2019t realize were about nuclear war, such as \u201cI Melt With You,\u201d a favorite from my college days that I thought was about \u201cmelting\u201d emotionally but, as it turns out, was about, you know, \nactually melting\n.\n \nEnjoy!\nYou\u2019ll see a bit less of me in the next few weeks as I complete my last tour teaching in Harvard\u2019s Summer School\u2014a bittersweet milestone that rounds out 35 years of my previous career as an educator. I will be taking time this summer to work on an updated version of \nThe Death of Expertise\n, in which I\u2019ll talk about how the rejection of expertise is a problem that has gotten much worse in recent years, even before the coronavirus pandemic.

    "body": "This Juneteenth, spend time with beautiful pieces of writing that highlight the fortitude of Black Americans. \nMonday, June 19, 2023 \n \nThis Juneteenth, spend time with six beautiful pieces of writing that highlight the fortitude of Black Americans throughout the country\u2019s history.\nView in browser\nOn June 19, 1865, two years after the signing of the Emancipation Proclamation, word reached Texas notifying enslaved people of their freedom. Juneteenth is a holiday honoring this delayed freedom. But it\u2019s not solely a day of celebration: Juneteenth also inspires reflection on all the work left to do to ensure the fullness of Black Americans\u2019 liberty.\nDespite a host of regional and statewide celebrations over the past century and a half, Juneteenth became recognized as a federal holiday only in 2021, when President Joe Biden signed a bill to that effect\u2014likely as a response to George Floyd\u2019s murder and the ensuing wave of organizing in 2020.\nThis year, I invite you to read six beautiful pieces of writing that offer a window into the state of Black America. In each of these stories, I am reminded of the fortitude of my enslaved ancestors, and of Black Americans\u2019 resistance to oppression at every point in this country\u2019s history.\nToday we remember those who fought for their freedom, and we reflect on ensuring that dream is fully realized. \u201cMemory is the purpose of Juneteenth,\u201d my colleague Vann R. Newkirk II \nwrote\n in 2019. \u201cOn Juneteenth, it seizes the narrative, reminding the country of its original debt, and the debts it has since accrued.\u201d\n\u2014 \nAmina Kilpatrick, assistant editor\nYour Reading List\n \nKerry James Marshall, \"Our Town,\" 1995 (Crystal Bridges Museum of American Art, Bentonville, Arkansas. Photo: Vancouver Art Gallery. \u00a9 Kerry James Marshall. Courtesy of the artist and David Zwirner, London)\n \nThe Truth About Black Freedom\n \nBy\n \nDaina Ramey Berry\n \nJuneteenth is a celebration of just one way that Black people either created freedom or found it, often on their own terms. What we acknowledge this Juneteenth must be about more than what was given. It must be about what had already been claimed. Enslaved people were always the first givers of their own liberty. They did not wait idly for proclamations and decrees. They stole fragments of liberty and created spaces of freedom within the institution of slavery, even before they were ever legally \u2018free.\u2019 They put down their rakes and hoes and rested on beds of hay; they stole afternoon naps while hanging tobacco; they held nighttime parties to dance away their pain, and they held prayer meetings in the woods to nourish their spirits with hope.\nRead the full article. \n \nHistorically, Juneteenth has not been widely recognized outside of black communities. (Library of Congress)\n \nBlack Joy\u2014Not Corporate Acknowledgment\u2014Is the Heart of Juneteenth\n \nBy\n \nKellie Carter Jackson\n \nThough holidays, symbols, statues, and flags matter, it will take more than increased recognition of Juneteenth to combat racism. If not followed with substantive change, the relatively recent scramble to acknowledge Juneteenth will just feel like virtue signaling, acts of solidarity that ring hollow.\nRead the full article. \n \n(Photograph by Aaron Turner; archival image from Library of Congress)\n \nStories of Slavery, From Those Who Survived It\n \nBy\n \nClint Smith\n \nFrom 1936 to 1938, interviewers from the [Federal Writers\u2019 Project] gathered the firsthand accounts of more than 2,300 formerly enslaved people in at least 17 states. \u2026 While many of these narratives vividly portray the horror of slavery\u2014of families separated, of backs beaten, of bones crushed\u2014embedded within them are stories of enslaved people dancing together on Saturday evenings as respite from their work; of people falling in love, creating pockets of time to see each other when the threat of violence momentarily ceased; of children skipping rocks in a creek or playing hide-and-seek amid towering oak trees, finding moments when the movement of their bodies was not governed by anything other than their own sense of wonder. These small moments\u2014the sort that freedom allows us to take for granted\u2014have stayed with me.\nRead the full article. \n \n(Carlos Javier Ortiz)\n \nThe Case for Reparations\n \nBy\n \nTa-Nehisi Coates\n \nHaving been enslaved for 250 years, black people were not left to their own devices. They were terrorized. In the Deep South, a second slavery ruled. In the North, legislatures, mayors, civic associations, banks, and citizens all colluded to pin black people into ghettos, where they were overcrowded, overcharged, and undereducated. Businesses discriminated against them, awarding them the worst jobs and the worst wages. Police brutalized them in the streets. And the notion that black lives, black bodies, and black wealth were rightful targets remained deeply rooted in the broader society. Now we have half-stepped away from our long centuries of despoilment, promising, \u2018Never again.\u2019 But still we are haunted.\nRead the full article. \n \nA daytime protest on June 11, 1964, of the slave market in St. Augustine, Florida (Associated Press)\n \nBalancing the Ledger on Juneteenth\n \nBy\n \nVann R. Newkirk II\n \nThe idea of reparations is somehow both avant-garde and extraordinarily old. Its reemergence stems from a broad reassessment of the trajectory of black America\u2019s material conditions, and a realization that even with the extraordinary efforts of individual black people and some political and economic protections, true equality always appears just out of reach.\nRead the full article. \n \n(Colby Deal / Magnum)\n \nConsidering \nRoe v.

    "body": "Entertainment musts from Maya Chung \nSunday, June 18, 2023 \n \n \nKelli Mar\u00eda Korducki\n \nSenior editor\nGood morning, and welcome back to The Daily\u2019s Sunday culture edition, in which one \nAtlantic\n writer reveals what\u2019s keeping them entertained.\nToday\u2019s special guest is \nMaya Chung\n, an associate editor on the Books team and a frequent contributor to our \nBooks Briefing newsletter\n. Lately, Maya has been enjoying the style and ambience of the French novelist Maylis de Kerangal, is still thinking about a recent exhibition of work by the surrealist 20th-century artist Meret Oppenheim, and is enjoying post-hype-cycle prestige TV, which includes the fourth and final season of \nSuccession\n.\nFirst, here are three Sunday reads from \nThe Atlantic\n:\nA star reporter\u2019s break with reality\nThe instant pot failed because it was a good product.\nThe fake poor bride\nThe Culture Survey: Maya Chung\n \n(Courtesy of HBO)\n \nView in browser\nThe upcoming event I\u2019m most looking forward to: \nI really hope to see the Shakespeare in the Park \nproduction\n of \nHamlet\n in New York\u2019s Central Park this summer. The early pandemic made me realize how much I\u2019d taken for granted living in a city with such incredible theater, so I\u2019ve been cherishing the experience of seeing live theater this past year. And there\u2019s nothing like Shakespeare in the Park\u2014whatever the play, it\u2019s a totally enchanting experience. This year it\u2019s a contemporary \nHamlet\n directed by the celebrated Kenny Leon, who also did this season\u2019s Tony-winning revival of \nTopdog/Underdog\n on Broadway. Setting Shakespeare in the modern day can sometimes be gimmicky, but when it\u2019s done right, it captures the magic of his work, and how enduring it remains. \n[Related: \nAll of Shakespeare\u2019s plays are about race.\n]\nThe television show I\u2019m most enjoying right now: \nI don\u2019t love watching shows when they\u2019re at the height of their popularity, because when there\u2019s a ton of chatter, I have a hard time figuring out what my actual, original thoughts are (and if I have any!). So I just finally started watching the fourth season of \nSuccession\n. Avoiding spoilers while working on the Culture desk here has been nearly impossible, and some of the big bombshells did slip through. But I\u2019m still savoring all of the delicious drama and insult-hurling. \n[Related: \nThe \nSuccession\n plot that explained the whole series\n]\nI\u2019m even more behind on \nThe Handmaid\u2019s Tale\n, which I also just started watching a couple weekends ago. The show came out in 2017, which wasn\u2019t \nthat\n long ago, but it has been really fascinating to watch it with a little bit of distance, especially given the political climate in which it premiered. Also, the performances are spectacular, and it\u2019s visually gorgeous.\n [Related: \nThe visceral, woman-centric horror of \nThe Handmaid\u2019s Tale\n]\nBest novel I\u2019ve recently read, and the best work of nonfiction:\n I read Maylis de Kerangal\u2019s short novella \nEastbound\n earlier this year, which is about a young Russian conscript who, once aboard the Trans-Siberian rail, decides to desert and meets a French woman who helps him. I haven\u2019t stopped thinking about it. I then read de Kerangal\u2019s book \nThe Heart\n, a similarly tense novel about the events and characters involved in a heart transplant\u2014including the young man who dies in an accident, the woman who receives his heart, and the doctors and bureaucrats who make the transplant possible. In recent years I\u2019ve sought out books for style and ambience rather than plot, perhaps because of my fickle attention span or perhaps after reading one too many plodding books. But de Kerangal reminded me how transportive it is when an author successfully creates that itching desire to know what happens next\u2014without forgoing an ounce of style.\nAs for nonfiction, I\u2019ve loved Christina Sharpe\u2019s \nOrdinary Notes\n, a book of fragmentary \u201cnotes\u201d\u2014which include memoir, theory, photos, and poetic musings\u2014about Black life in America. I\u2019ve been reading the book in blips and spurts over the past couple of months, which in some ways has felt like the best way to read it, because it\u2019s meant I\u2019ve been carrying Sharpe\u2019s intelligent, lyrical voice around with me.\nAn author I will read anything by: \nFor a long time I didn\u2019t have an answer to this, but as a books editor, you get asked this, or a version of this question, a lot. Though my answer will likely change, right now, it\u2019s Rachel Cusk and Rachel Ingalls. Two very different writers, both completely enrapturing and honest and intricate. \n[Related: \nRachel Cusk won\u2019t stay still.\n]\nThe last museum or gallery show that I loved: \nI loved seeing Meret Oppenheim\u2019s work at the \nMuseum of Modern Art\n earlier this year. I was previously uninitiated in her work but came away from the show entranced by her bleakness and her whimsy. My favorite part came near the end, where, across opposite walls on large sheets of paper, Oppenheim had made a blueprint for a retrospective of her work in Bern. For this, she drew tiny reproductions of her works so that the curators could see what order they should be displayed in. It made me strangely sad to see the artist\u2019s career captured two-dimensionally, in such miniature. But that\u2019s probably the wrong way to look at it; it\u2019s likely that Oppenheim was proudly looking back at her life\u2019s work, taking control of how exactly it should be consumed.\nThe last thing that made me snort with laughter: \nEven the title of Nicole Holofcener\u2019s new movie, \nYou Hurt My Feelings\n, made me snort\u2014I love a literal title. (When I encountered the similarly prosaic book title \nDogs That Know When Their Owners Are Coming Home\n, by the biologist Rupert Sheldrake, in this lovely \nprofile\n of his son, the mycologist Merlin Sheldrake, I knew I had to get my hands on a copy.) In the movie, a woman falls apart when she overhears her husband admitting that he doesn\u2019t like her new book. I\u2019m an editor, not a writer, so I was able to laugh heartily at this premise. But I could imagine that for my writer colleagues, this one might hit a little too close to home. \n[Related: \nYou Hurt My Feelings\n is a hilarious anxiety spiral.\n]\nThe Week Ahead\nSeason 2 of \nThe Bear\n (all episodes streaming on Hulu on Thursday)\nI Am Homeless If This Is Not My Home\n, Lorrie Moore\u2019s strange new novel, full of death but also the \nauthor\u2019s trademark humor\n (on sale Tuesday)\nAsteroid City\n, Wes Anderson\u2019s new film that shows the \ndirector at his best\n, according to our critic (in theaters everywhere Friday)\nEssay\n \n(Illustration by Ben Kothe / The Atlantic.

    "subject": "Why it matters who caused inflation",
    "body": "Plus: The fake poor bride \nFriday, June 16, 2023 \n \n \nLora Kelley\n \nAssociate editor\nHi, everyone! I\u2019m Lora Kelley, and I am a new writer for the Daily. I\u2019m thrilled to be working with Tom Nichols and the team to bring you the newsletter. I joined \nThe Atlantic\n in an interesting week for the economy\u2014after two years of runaway inflation, which led the Federal Reserve to crank up interest rates, the government announced on Wednesday that it would be pressing pause on its hikes for now. Today I explore a question that\u2019s dividing economists: Whose fault is inflation, anyway\u2014and why does it matter?\nFirst, here are three new stories from \nThe Atlantic:\nThe fake poor bride\nCar-rental companies are ruining EVs.\nThe choice the Philippines didn\u2019t want to make \nWho\u2019s to Blame?\n \n(The Atlantic / Barbara Alper/Getty)\n \nView in browser\nAmerica can take a breath: Inflation is finally cooling off. It\u2019s now hovering at about 4 percent, according to Consumer Price Index (CPI) data released earlier this week, down from the \n9.1 percent peak\n in June of last year. But the Fed is saying that it would like inflation to be closer to 2 percent, and that it may raise interest rates again in the future to try to get the country there. Now that inflation has abated (for the moment), discussions have turned to how we got here.\nFed Chair Jerome Powell recently said that \nrising wages were not the principal driver of inflation\n. As economists, the media, and laypeople alike try to figure out whom to blame instead, fingers are pointing at the consumers who started spending large amounts of \nsaved dollars and stimulus checks in 2020\n; at the corporations that have seen juicy profit margins after raising their prices; and, in Sweden, even at \u2026 \nBeyonc\u00e9\n?\nTrying to understand the factors that fueled inflation is important, because whom we blame for inflation also shapes what we do about it. If inflation is caused primarily by overheated consumer demand, then it makes sense for the Fed to quell spending by hiking interest rates. But if corporations, rather than consumers, are driving inflation by raising their prices, then other tools may make more sense.\nOne conventional explanation is that widespread consumer spending \nstarted in 2020\n and persisted in the years that followed, causing demand to explode and prices to spike. Some economists have called the influx of post-lockdown spending on goods and travel \u201crevenge spending,\u201d and recent data show that it is \nreceding\n after two years.\nThe Fed has consistently raised interest rates in its past 10 meetings in part to get consumers to stop spending money\u2014and so far, the hikes seem to be working. \u201cThe Fed has done the thing you would expect the Fed to do,\u201d Chris Conlon, an economist at NYU, told me. \u201cRight now, it looks like raising rates is starting to cool demand and temper expectations.\u201d (Pulling this lever is imprecise, however, and can cause pain: High interest rates have triggered layoffs, especially in tech, and made it harder for a lot of people to afford big-ticket purchases such as houses and cars.)\nAlthough CPI data show clear patterns in consumer spending and demand, another explanation, that corporations are fueling inflation by raising prices in order to increase profits, has been gaining steam in recent months. \nSome economists are taking a closer look\n at the idea that corporations\u2019 profit margins could be playing a role in \nkeeping inflation high\n\u2014especially after recent \nearnings calls\n in which corporations reported that profits are up even as they are selling fewer goods.\nIsabella Weber, an economist at the University of Massachusetts at Amherst, argues that a host of geopolitical factors have \nprovided \u201ccover\u201d\n for firms to raise prices. Weber refers to the phenomenon as \u201c\nsellers\u2019 inflation\n,\u201d but others call this \u201cgreedflation,\u201d \u201cexcuseflation,\u201d and \u201cprofit-led inflation.\u201d Companies \nwrestled back pricing power\n earlier in the pandemic\u2014and consumers, seeing high prices at the gas station and everywhere else, came to expect higher prices. Now, some ask, are companies doing more than simply responding to costs, and instead just ramping up prices to pad their margins\u2014and in the process, feeding inflation like a pandemic baker feeding sourdough starter?\n\u201cIf you believe that big corporations are the ones who are pushing up prices,\u201d Rakeen Mabud, the chief economist at the progressive nonprofit Groundwork Collaborative, told me, \u201cthen there are a lot more tools in our toolbox\u201d to address the issue. \u201cWe can go way beyond the Fed,\u201d she added. Those tools, she told me, include tax policies that target excess profits or incentivize productive investment in firms. \u201cWe\u2019re really seeing a big rethink of some orthodox understandings of inflation and its causes,\u201d she said.\nConlon, however, is interested in possible factors beyond greed that may be pushing companies to raise prices. \u201cStrong demand will also generate rising prices, rising profits, higher output,\u201d he told me. He and his colleagues recently \npublished\n a \npaper\n that found that, from 2018 to 2022, there was no correlation between the companies whose markups have risen the most and the industries in which prices have risen the quickest.\nThe exact causes and dynamics of our current inflationary moment may take time to unravel\u2014Conlon predicted that in a few years, we may have more information about how companies behaved these past few years. These data will be worth a close look, especially if shocks to the economy continue apace in years to come. It\u2019s become a bit of a clich\u00e9 to say that we are living in unprecedented times. But a rash of recent, intersecting crises\u2014supply-chain snarls, the war in Ukraine, elevated gas prices, bird flu\u2014did scramble consumer spending, leading companies to raise prices over the past few years. Things may stay strange. Understanding what happened could inform how we respond to future shocks.\nI will leave you with some good news, after all this talk of disaster: Global inflation is not all Beyonc\u00e9\u2019s fault, though Swedish economists said this week that her Renaissance tour in Stockholm caused a surge in local prices\u2014\u201cIt\u2019s quite astonishing for a single event,\u201d one economist told \nthe \nFinancial Times\n. One person, even an amazing one, can\u2019t single-handedly cause inflation. But \nher music\n can probably alleviate some of the pain of thinking through all of this.\nToday\u2019s News\nAfter a multiyear investigation into George Floyd\u2019s murder, the Justice Department \nreleased a report\n finding frequent instances of excessive force by Minneapolis police officers, and unlawful discrimination against Black and Native American people.\nThe gunman who killed 11 people at Pittsburgh\u2019s Tree of Life synagogue in 2018 was \nconvicted\n by a federal jury.\nSeveral federal agencies, including the U.S. Department of Energy, were \naffected\n by a global hacking campaign, according to officials.\nDispatches\nThe Books Briefing\n: Gal Beckerman reflects on \nthe powerful weirdness of Cormac McCarthy\n.\nExplore all of our newsletters here.\nEvening Read\n \n(Carolyn Drake / Magnum)\n \nPay a Little Less Attention to Your Friends\n \nBy\n \nRichard A. Friedman\n \nAbout two years ago, one of my psychiatry patients was giving me particular trouble. He had depression, and despite his usual chattiness, I just couldn\u2019t find a way to engage him on our Zoom calls. He seemed to be avoiding eye contact and stayed quiet, giving only short answers to my questions. I worried he would drop out of treatment, so I suggested that we do something I rarely do with patients: go for a walk.\nWe met at a park on a brisk fall day and sat on a bench when we were done. Among the few people nearby was a group of workers, who were cleaning the grounds, chatting loudly, and obviously having fun. As I tried to ask my patient about his studies, he kept breaking eye contact with me to look at the workers. Just as we were finishing, he became tearful and said that he felt very lonely. It was the most he\u2019d opened up to me in many months, and I was relieved. Perhaps the sight of these convivial young men was a reminder of his painful isolation that he simply couldn\u2019t ignore. Or perhaps the act of walking together had finally made him comfortable enough to open up. Either way, it never would have happened on Zoom or in my office.\nRead the full article. \nMore From \nThe Atlantic\nWhat youth activists do that adults can\u2019t\nWhat does it mean to be Latino?\nWhy are so many women being told their hormones are out of whack?\nCulture Break\n \n(Netflix)\n \nWatch. \nThe final season of the sparkly teen comedy \nNever Have I Ever\n, on Netflix, cleverly solves TV\u2019s college problem.\nListen. \nNew albums\n by Janelle Mon\u00e1e, Jake Shears, and Jessie Ware usher in the age of pleasure.\nPlay our daily crossword.\nAdvertisement \n \n \nP.S.\nI know I cannot compete with \nTom Nichols\n when it comes to 1980s movie references.

The \u00c9ric Rohmer movie, whose title translates from French to \nBoyfriends and Girlfriends\n, is a New Wave romantic comedy about, yes, boyfriends and girlfriends. But to my pleasant surprise, it was also about jobs, and how a new class of suburban young people was fitting work into their lives. Against a backdrop of pools and excellent outfits, the characters discuss bureaucracy, commuting into Paris, and having or not having a boss. I think a lot about \u201cthe future of work,\u201d so it was fun to dip into the past of work too.\nDid someone forward you this email? \nSign up here.\nIsabel Fattal contributed to this newsletter.\nMost Popular on \nThe Atlantic\nA Star Reporter\u2019s Break With Reality\nThe Fake Poor Bride\nCar-Rental Companies Are Ruining EVs\nThe Choice the Philippines Didn\u2019t Want to Make\nThe Instant Pot Failed Because It Was a Good Product\nMeet us at The Atlantic Festival \n \nThe Atlantic Festival returns this September 28 and 29, bringing you thought-provoking conversations, book talks, premiere film screenings, and a community of fascinating people to meet.

    "body": "Plus: The Instant Pot failed because it was a good product. \nThursday, June 15, 2023 \n \n \nTom Nichols\n \nStaff writer\nWhen J. D. Vance first ran for office, he impressed some observers as a bridge between red and blue America. I was less impressed, but as a senator, he\u2019s worse than even I expected; he\u2019s become part of a caucus of panderers who are betraying the people they claim to represent.\nFirst, here are four new stories from \nThe Atlantic:\nThe Instant Pot failed because it was a good product\n.\nThe Toyota Corolla theory of college\nThe path to happiness is narrow but easy\n.\nTrump\u2019s bag man\nFrom Hillbilly to MAGA Senator\n \n(Drew Angerer / Getty)\n \nView in browser\nI \nwrote about\n J. D. Vance during his Senate run back in 2021. I was appalled at his campaign and his rhetoric, but he has turned out to be even worse as a legislator than he was as a candidate.\nVance initially tried to position himself as a reasonable man from humble origins, someone who understood the angst of rural, Forgotten-Man America. He wrote a book about it, and in 2016 he \nwarned\n the public\u2014in \nThe Atlantic\n, no less\u2014that Donald Trump was \u201ccultural heroin.\u201d When he \nmoved back to Ohio\n and stepped into the GOP Senate primary, Vance was running behind Josh Mandel, the hyper-ambitious former treasurer of Ohio, who was saying and tweeting unhinged things as a way of pulling out \nall the stops\n to capture a coalition of the most extreme primary voters. For a short second, Vance tried not to jump into the same septic tank.\nBut when you\u2019re getting millions of dollars in \nsupport from Peter Thiel\n, losing to someone as off the wall as Mandel isn\u2019t noble\u2014it\u2019s just \nlosing\n. And so Vance retooled both his approach and his personality. He pledged his sword to Donald Trump, who duly endorsed him and lifted him to a win in the primary. Vance then ran as the MAGA candidate, appearing onstage with Marjorie Taylor Greene and Matt Gaetz and accepting their endorsements. This combination of pusillanimity and shamelessness, along with Trump\u2019s support, helped Vance defeat the centrist Democrat Tim Ryan, and he headed back east to Washington.\nOnce in the Senate, Vance shed the MAGA clown costume and became a responsible center-right legislator, advancing the interests of the poor and forgotten in Ohio and \u2026 I\u2019m kidding, of course. Vance did no such thing. What he once wore as electoral camouflage is now tattooed all over him, in yet another fulfillment of the late Kurt Vonnegut\u2019s \nwarning\n that, eventually, \u201cwe are what we pretend to be.\u201d\nIn politics, you pay at least some of the debt you owe for a crucial endorsement, but Vance is paying it all\u2014including a brutal \nvig\n. It\u2019s one thing to hand-wave about supporting the nominee; it\u2019s another entirely to speak up when staying quiet would be just as effective, and perhaps more sensible. But when you\u2019re writing \narticles\n defending Donald Trump\u2019s \nforeign policy\n\u2014a radioactive subject many Republicans would rather ignore\u2014you\u2019re not just paying off what you owe the sharks; you\u2019re begging to be part of the crew.\nSome credit where it is due: After a major train derailment in Ohio, Vance teamed up with his senior colleague Democratic Senator Sherrod Brown to advance \na rail-safety bill\n. But that was an easy call; when I worked in the Senate many years ago, we called similar legislative proposals \u201capple pie,\u201d as in \u201cMom and apple pie and the American flag,\u201d a bill or resolution that any legislator could support without hesitation.\nBut Vance couldn\u2019t resist the intoxicating call of performative irresponsibility, and he has managed to latch on to almost every MAGA hot-button issue in his short time on the Hill. (He even fawned over Tucker Carlson after he was fired by Fox News; most other Republicans quietly treated Carlson\u2019s canceled show like a \nbarrel of industrial sludge\n that they allowed to sink in a dark lake without trace or comment.) Last week, Vance responded to Trump\u2019s \nindictment\n on 37 federal charges by \nvowing to put a hold\n on all Justice Department nominees.\u00a0\u00a0\nFor those of you unfamiliar with \nthis tactic\n, many senior posts in the U.S. government constitutionally require confirmation by the Senate. A smaller and less hierarchical body than the House, the Senate does much of its business, including scheduling votes on nominees, by \u201cunanimous consent.\u201d The current rules of the Senate allow any single senator to put a \u201chold\u201d on a nominee by withholding such consent, thus preventing the chamber from acting on the nomination. This is a fairly routine maneuver most of the time; sometimes a senator places a hold because of a particular concern or question\u2014or sometimes, because of \na political vendetta\n.\nBut Vance is just shilling for Trump by preventing the entire Senate from voting on any and all nominees to the Justice Department. This puts him in the exalted company of another Senate giant, Alabama\u2019s Tommy Tuberville, who is holding up the promotions of some 200 senior U.S. military officers because he\u2019s upset about expanded \nabortion provisions\n for service members. (He is also feuding with the Pentagon over various other \nculture-war grievances\n.) Vance and Tuberville are engaging in \u201cblanket\u201d holds not against any one person, but against an \nentire class \nof nominees.\nThis is not the Senate\u2019s \u201cadvice and consent\u201d; this is the howling of the Yahoo Caucus. As Jill Lawrence \nnoted today\n in \nThe Bulwark\n, the GOP is engaging in a \u201cfull-on trashing and undermining of the government,\u201d creating \u201ca civic and physical hazard to America\u201d merely to defend Trump from even mild criticism. (Meanwhile, over in the House, Representative Thomas Massie of Kentucky is a good choice to be parliamentarian of this Yahoo Caucus, \ntweeting today\n that \u201cno member of Congress can be prosecuted for reading aloud on the floor any of the documents Trump allegedly has copies of.\u201d Massie, apparently, thinks it would help Trump\u2019s case to read top-secret documents live on national television.)\nTuberville has repeatedly shown, much like Trump himself, that he does not understand how the American government actually works. Vance (a graduate of Ohio State and Yale) and Massie (who holds a degree in engineering from MIT) both know better, and that makes their actions even more odious. These legislators are showing contempt not only for their constitutional duty but for their constituents by treating them like credulous rubes in order to harvest their anger and their votes.\nTuberville, perhaps, never had a chance to be a better legislator. Massie might simply be an engineer who knows a lot about one thing and almost nothing about anything else. But Vance is different: He\u2019s an intelligent and educated man who has chosen a shameful path in Congress as if his lifetime of opportunities and second chances never happened.\nRelated:\nThe moral collapse of J.

You can even ask them to make you rich.\nJoshua Mayo, a YouTube personality who makes videos about work-from-home \u201cside hustles\u201d and methods for becoming a millionaire before age 30, told me recently that his audience of mostly young people doesn\u2019t want to work a standard 9-to-5 job for several decades and then retire off of their 401(k). \u201cA lot of them don\u2019t find that appealing,\u201d he said. \u201cSo they\u2019re kind of turning to side hustles.\u201d Younger generations \noften talk\n about the total \nfakeness of money\n and the \nsurreal position\n of always having to collect it.

While the content isn\u2019t outdated, the video style is not as engaging and interactive as it could be. \nAfter a 10 min video that is mostly text, it has you read the same presented information in long lists. Needs to be less text heavy and only reestablish high level points in text \u00a0\nIs there an opportunity to integrate scenarios to teach and quiz the trainee on the next correct action\nThe Talent Review video did a better job at using relatable scenarios to teach as opposed to just listing info on the screen \u2013 the talent team would personally still like to see actors portray them / speak to the trainee through the camera, as opposed to narration only. \nCondensing \u2013 rather than separating into modules and videos, would it be possible to create 2 modules total, one specific to talent acquisition and one for talent management and then split into multiples sections / lessons per module\n\u00a0\nLet me know your thoughts. \nBest\n\u00a0\nRashida\u00a0Peters\n \n(she/her)\nSenior\u00a0Manager,\u00a0Inclusion\u00a0&\u00a0Diversity\u00a0|\u00a0\nRichemont\u00a0Americas\nAt\u00a0Richemont,\u00a0We\u00a0Craft\u00a0The\u00a0Future\n645\u00a0Fifth\u00a0Avenue,\u00a0Olympic\u00a0Tower\u00a0|\u00a0New\u00a0York\u00a0NY\u00a010022\u00a0|\u00a0United\u00a0States\n(mobile)\u00a0+16465124329 | (email)\u00a0\nrashida.peters@richemont.com\n\u00a0\nPlease note that we practice work flexibility at Richemont with teams working across the globe in multiple time zones.

    "subject": "What the teen-smartphone panic says about adults",
    "body": "Plus: Jack Smith\u2019s backup option \nWednesday, June 14, 2023 \n \n \nKelli Mar\u00eda Korducki\n \nSenior editor\nA growing body of research complicates the question of social media\u2019s effects on teens. But that hasn\u2019t stopped many adults from perpetual worrying about its presumed perils.\nFirst, here are three new stories from \nThe Atlantic\n:\nJack Smith\u2019s backup option\nTrump can\u2019t bluster his way through court.\nThe gross spectacle of murder fandom\nGrown-People Lore\n \n(Nicolas Tucat / AFP via Getty)\n \nView in browser\nMore than half a decade has passed since the psychologist Jean Twenge asked, in a viral \nAtlantic \nfeature\n, whether smartphones had \u201cdestroyed\u201d the generation we\u2019ve since anointed as Gen Z. In the intervening years, asking that question has become a popular pastime, a way to fill the uncomfortable silences between other societal crises (of which there have been plenty). Yet despite the years of hand-wringing over the presumed perils of young people\u2019s use of smartphones\u2014and social media, in particular\u2014a growing body of research complicates the equation.\nSaid equation was never exactly straightforward in the first place. Even last month\u2019s high-profile \nadvisory\n on social media and youth mental health, from the U.S. surgeon general, acknowledged both negative \nand\n positive effects of young people\u2019s connectivity through digital platforms. As my colleague Kaitlyn Tiffany \nput it\n in a recent article, \u201cThe results have continually been mixed: Screens are ubiquitous, and they\u2019re personal.\u201d\nIf the science is so tough to pin down, why is the panic so widespread? Blame that common menace of seemingly unsolvable equations: too many variables.\nConsider the research on smartphone use by adults. In terms of mental-health correlates, studies have found a similarly mixed bag as they have for kids and teens. Such uneven findings point toward the need to ask more, and perhaps different, questions about the technological, sociocultural, and material factors behind people\u2019s reported states of mind, and perhaps hone in on areas of overlap. The takeaway might then evolve from \u201csocial media causes anxiety and depression\u201d to, for example, \u201csocial-media content featuring people having rewarding experiences such as fun and friendship \ncan worsen\n symptoms of anxiety.\u201d But though that logic is true across the board, when adults are the research subject group in question, such nuance is likelier to enter the picture than when observers are probing \nthe trouble with young people today\n\u2014a conversation rife with conflated correlations and causations.\nThen there\u2019s the X factor of what I\u2019ll diplomatically call \u201cgrown-people lore.\u201d Those of us old enough to remember navigating jobs and social lives before everyone carried around a tiny pocket computer are wont to \nidealize\n that now-improbable-seeming \nbefore\n time, often forgetting that it came with its own inconveniences and anxieties. We also forget the panics that pervaded adults\u2019 conversations during our coming-of-age, which may have differed in their content but otherwise echoed the tenor of current social-media debates. (In my late-1990s preadolescence, for instance, there was much angst over the potential impact of music lyrics on young people\u2019s mental health, and serious debate as to whether the work of artists \nsuch as Marilyn Manson\n increased teens\u2019 susceptibility to violent behavior.)\nNostalgia colors perspective, and all but certainly shapes widespread hypotheses of the clear and present dangers young people face. Because of this, adults across generations, and in every day and age, have demonstrated a knack for neglecting to apply the lessons of prior eras\u2019 panics to the present moment. Today\u2019s Gen X and Millennial parents fretting about their children\u2019s social-media use may or may not be comforted to learn that, according to some studies, the overconsumption of TV and video games that marked many of their late-20th-century childhoods likely had a comparable impact on their tender, developing brains\u2014for better and for worse.\nThis is not to diminish the real risks of excess social-media use on young people. A \npronounced spike\n in teen mental illness neatly aligns with the dawn of the smartphone age\u2014or, as the social psychologist and \nAtlantic \ncontributor Jonathan Haidt \ncalls it\n, \u201cthe transition to phone-based childhoods.\u201d Parents and teachers see the \nramifications\n firsthand: shortened attention spans, distractibility, strained interpersonal relationships, and, yes, elevated rates of depression and anxiety disorders, especially among girls.\nMany young people \nare wary\n of tech dependency too. Their concerns, however, show a wider scope of analysis than those addressed in today\u2019s social-media-dominated discussions, revealing a desire to find paths to a peaceful coexistence with digital tools, and also reflecting real introspection, wisdom, and resilience. This generation may indeed face hazards that their predecessors did not. But the evidence certainly seems to suggest that they\u2019re far from a cohort \u201cdestroyed.\u201d\nRelated:\nNo one knows exactly what social media is doing to teens.\nGet phones out of schools now.\nToday\u2019s News\nPolitico\n \nreported\n that former President Donald Trump raised more than $2 million at his first major campaign fundraiser of the season, hours after his arraignment in Florida, according to a source familiar with the campaign.\u00a0\u00a0\nThe Southern Baptist Convention \nvoted to uphold\n the expulsion of two churches for having women pastors.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\nA fishing boat carrying migrants \nsank off the coast\n of Greece.

I\u2019ve enjoyed the filmmaker\u2019s work for many years\u2014his methodical aesthetic, the subject of a \nthousand weak parodies\n, might be the most recognizable in moviemaking right now. But in the past decade or so, I struggled to excavate much deeper meaning beneath Anderson\u2019s fine-tuned flair, and began to worry that he was disappearing inside his own eccentricities. \nIsle of Dogs \nand \nThe French Dispatch\n, in particular, seemed like charming, flimsy confections. His new film, \nAsteroid City\n, is a vigorous rebuke to that very critique. It pairs his inimitable visual elegance with an impassioned argument about the power of storytelling. And it\u2019s a reminder that Anderson remains one of cinema\u2019s best.\nRead the full article. \nMore From \nThe Atlantic\nSaturn\u2019s frozen moon just got a lot more interesting.\nSummer vacation is moving indoors.\nThe owners who run teams for the money\nCulture Break\n \n(Illustration by Ben Kothe / The Atlantic.

I am circling back on the IDIs for Groupm\u2026\n\u00a0\nI am wondering if we can get a more comprehensive report. The one you prepared only has 4 individuals, but many more took the assessment over the course of the past year \u2013 here is a screen shot of your primary tracker sorted to show only the Groupm assessments (I filtered by column E using both spellings of Groupm). Even though a lot of those folks were taking the assessment in the context of a different project, I would like to include them in a new report, to get the most data possible.\u00a0 ALSO \u2013 we need to include Serena Anthony, who is the CPO for Groupm, she isn\u2019t on this list because she has a WPP email. \n\u00a0\nWould you be able to run a new group report with ALL the \u00a0folks on this tracker who have completed the assessment, plus Serena?\n\u00a0\nThe client is trying to get us a few more responses, so we may need to do this again next week, but for now, I\u2019d be really curious to see the fuller report.\n\u00a0\nThanks Kaitlin \u2013 let me know if that is do-able!\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\nFrom:\n Kaitlin Nonweiler <\nk.nonweiler@lcwmail.com\n> \nSent:\n Tuesday, April 25, 2023 5:34 PM\nTo:\n Sarah Nodarse <\ns.nodarse@lcwmail.com\n>\nSubject:\n Re: WPP & GroupM IDI Reports\n\u00a0\nI attached the group reports!\n\u00a0\nDarn.

    "body": "Plus: No one knows exactly what social media is doing to teens. \nTuesday, June 13, 2023 \n \n \nTom Nichols\n \nStaff writer\nDonald Trump was arrested and arraigned today\u2014without incident\u2014and he has now pleaded not guilty to 37 charges tied to the alleged mishandling of classified documents. But before we see more possible indictments (from Georgia or the January 6 investigation), Americans should not lose sight of the astonishing charges read to Trump today in Florida.\nFirst, here are three new stories from \nThe Atlantic\n:\nNo one knows exactly what social media is doing to teens.\nThe threat from Trump\u2019s supporters has evolved.\nThe plutocrat vs. the monopoly\nToast.\n \n(Stephanie Keith / Getty Images)\n \nView in browser\nPerhaps former Attorney General William Barr\u2014not a man I am given to quoting approvingly\u2014\nsaid it best\n:\nI was shocked by the degree of sensitivity of these documents and how many there were ... and I think the counts under the Espionage Act that he willfully retained those documents are solid counts \u2026 If even half of it is true, then he\u2019s toast.\nI\u2019m not so sure about the \u201ctoast\u201d part. Trump lucked out by drawing Judge Aileen Cannon, whom he appointed and whose last involvement with one of his cases produced a decision so biased in his favor and so \npoorly reasoned\n that a federal appeals court\u2014including two more Trump appointees\u2014\noverturned her ruling\n in a judicial body slam. And a Florida jury raises the odds that someone in one panel will simply refuse to convict no matter how strong the case. (MAGA emotions are running high: Trump\u2019s former aide Steve Bannon\u2014the beneficiary of a last-minute Trump pardon\u2014reacted to Barr\u2019s comments \nwith a warning\n: \u201cWe\u2019re gonna shove this up your ass, okay?\u201d)\nLet\u2019s just say that I will be pleasantly surprised if Trump one day faces anything worse than a few rounds of golf with an ankle monitor. But before the inevitable blizzard of motions and delays and general mayhem, I thought we should review the \nactual charges\n in the \nindictment\n itself.\nFirst, here\u2019s what the government claims Trump took to Florida:\nThe classified documents TRUMP stored in his boxes included information regarding defense and weapons capabilities of both the United States and foreign countries; United States nuclear programs; potential vulnerabilities of the United States and its allies to military attack; and plans for possible retaliation in response to a foreign attack. The unauthorized disclosure of these classified documents could put at risk the national security of the United States, foreign relations, the safety of the United States military, and human sources and the continued viability of sensitive intelligence collection methods.\nRemember, no one on the Trump team is really disputing this. \nSome Republicans\n, in a desperate struggle with reality, are suggesting that Trump did nothing wrong, but Trump\u2014who cannot stop talking\u2014says he had the right to take anything he wanted, especially after rendering the documents harmless using the \nKreskin\n Declassification Method.\nBut perhaps the materials were at least in a safe place:\nBetween January 2021 and August 2022, The Mar-a-Lago Club hosted more than 150 social events, including weddings, movie premieres, and fundraisers that together drew tens of thousands of guests.\nAh. But Trump has a Secret Service detail; could they help protect the documents?\n[The Secret Service] was not responsible for the protection of TRUMP's boxes or their contents. TRUMP did not inform the Secret Service that he was storing boxes containing classified documents at The Mar-a-Lago Club.\nOh.\nMeanwhile, Trump\u2019s aides\u2014including his alleged co-conspirator, Walt Nauta\u2014were moving this stuff around. (Nauta was indicted on six counts, including obstruction and making false statements, and he has not yet entered a plea; he requested an extension on his arraignment, now set for June 27.) When some of the boxes toppled over, Nauta apparently took a picture of classified material:\nOn December 7, 2021, NAUTA found several of TRUMP\u2019s boxes fallen and their contents spilled onto the floor of the Storage Room, including a document marked \u201cSECRET//REL TO USA, FVEY,\u201d which denoted that the information in the document was releasable only to the Five Eyes intelligence alliance consisting of Australia, Canada, New Zealand, the United Kingdom, and the United States. NAUTA texted Trump Employee 2, \u201cI opened the door and found this \u2026\u201d NAUTA also attached two photographs he took of the spill. Trump Employee 2 replied, \u201cOh no oh no,\u201d and \u201cI\u2019m sorry potus had my phone.\u201d One of the photographs NAUTA texted to Trump Employee 2 is depicted below with the visible classified information redacted.\nThe only thing missing here is \n\u201cYakety Sax\u201d\n as a soundtrack.\nBut perhaps Trump misunderstood or didn\u2019t realize what he had, and he wanted to cooperate with the government to get the papers back where they belong? Unfortunately, one of Trump\u2019s own lawyers made sure to memorialize Trump\u2019s comments on that issue\u2014because lawyers, despite the \nStringer Bell Rule\n, know when to protect themselves by \ntaking notes\n:\nWell what if we, what happens if we just don\u2019t respond at all or don\u2019t play ball with them?\nWouldn\u2019t it be better if we just told them we don\u2019t have anything here? Well look isn\u2019t it better if there are no documents?\nIn one of the more widely publicized \nmoments\n described in the indictment, Trump was apparently recorded, during a meeting with a writer working on a book (who was accompanied by his publisher) and two of Trump\u2019s staff, saying that he had a U.S. war plan against a foreign nation (read: \nIran\n) in his hand. He is recorded as admitting both that the document is classified and that he no longer has the power to declassify it. But for those of us who have worked with classified information, Smith adds an important detail:\nAt the time of this exchange, the writer, the publisher, and TRUMP\u2019s two staff members did not have security clearances or any need-to-know any classified information about a plan of attack on Country A.\nIf this happened, Trump released classified information to people who should not see classified information.\nThis incident is particularly galling because one of the president\u2019s former attorneys, Robert Ray, has been \narguing\n that although the charges in the indictment are serious, they don\u2019t show evidence of damage to U.S. national security. This is a risible claim: No one, at this point, can say with any confidence whether American national security has or has not been damaged. We do not live in a movie where intelligence leaks produce clear and instant disasters.\nBut more to the point, even Ray admitted that the government doesn\u2019t \nneed \nto prove such harm; that\u2019s not how any of this works. Trump faces 31 counts of \u201cwillful retention of national defense information,\u201d not some notional charge of \u201cactually damaging American security in some obvious way.\u201d As a former Defense Department employee, I can only imagine what would have happened had I spirited boxes of classified information to my home and then, after my arrest, said, \u201cWell, sure, I took it, but there\u2019s no evidence I\u2019ve hurt national security. At least not yet.\u201d\nDonald Trump is presumed innocent until proven guilty. Unfortunately, it will likely be a long time before we find out if our justice system is capable of holding a former president to account. But if these charges were leveled against any other American citizen, they would be, in Bill Barr\u2019s words, toast.\nRelated:\nWill Trump get a speedy trial?\nThis indictment is different.\nToday\u2019s News\nTwenty-two U.S. service members \nwere injured\n in a helicopter accident in northeast Syria.\nThe novelist \nCormac McCarthy\n \nhas died\n at the age of 89.\nNew York City Police Commissioner Keechant Sewell \nannounced her resignation\n after 18 months in the role.\nDispatches\nUp for Debate\n: \nYoung people, parents, and educators \nreflect on\n the potential hazards of smartphones for children.\nExplore all of our newsletters here.\nEvening Read\n \n(Rita Harper / eyevine / Redux)\n \nKiller Mike\u2019s Critique of Wokeness\n \nBy\n \nSpencer Kornhaber\n \nKiller Mike is a man of contradictions. He has campaigned for Bernie Sanders and rapped about celebrating Ronald Reagan\u2019s death; he also supports gun ownership and speaks warmly about Georgia\u2019s Republican governor, Brian Kemp. Years ago, he renounced the Christian faith he was raised with, but his first solo album in a decade, \nMichael\u2014\nwhose cover is a childhood photo of Mike, adorned with devil horns and a halo\u2014is laden with gospel choirs and biblical references. \u201cYou don\u2019t have to pick a side with me,\u201d the 48-year-old said over Zoom, amid tokes from a joint. \u201cYou gonna go to church with me. You gonna go to \nthe Blue Flame\n with me.\u201d\nThat flexibility has, at times, invited controversy. Last year, a \nHuffPost\n column\n referred to the rapper as \u201cmore politically dangerous than Kanye West\u201d because he\u2019d praised Kemp\u2019s outreach to Black constituents while the incumbent governor supported policies that Democrats say \nmake it harder\n for those constituents to vote. Though many of his songs envision \nviolent revolution\n, he went viral for asking protesters not to burn buildings during the George Floyd protests, leading some commentators to accuse him of \nplaying to too many sides\n.\nRead the full article. \nMore From \nThe Atlantic\nBeatlemania through Paul McCartney\u2019s camera\nYou don\u2019t have to cremate your cat.\nCulture Break\n \n(Al Levine / NBC Universal / Getty)\n \nRead. \n\u201c\nFieldnotes\n,\u201d a new poem by Zoe Hitzig.\n\u201cYou could tell by the gait, the way the body moved, and / when, and how, they approached.\u201d\nListen. \nThe \nHans and Franz\n episodes\n of the \nConan O\u2019Brien Needs a Friend\n podcast remind us that a \nvery stupid premise\n can make for the most hilarious movie.\nPlay our daily crossword.\nAdvertisement \n \n \nP.S.\nSummer is here (pretty much), and I have begun to dive into books.

    "body": "Plus: A star reporter\u2019s break with reality \nMonday, June 12, 2023 \n \n \nTom Nichols\n \nStaff writer\nAfter the second indictment of Donald Trump, some extremists in the Republican Party have made barely veiled threats of violence against their fellow citizens. People who believe in the American idea should respond with faith in the American constitutional order and open disdain for people in public life who are both dangerous and ridiculous.\nFirst, here are four new stories from \nThe Atlantic\n:\nA star reporter\u2019s break with reality\nThe Vision Pro is the perfect gadget for the apocalypse.\nNow political polarization comes for marriage prospects.\nThe corrosive legacy of Silvio Berlusconi\nVigilance and Scorn\n \nPistols celebrating the presidency of Donald Trump are readied for display at the Kahr Firearms Group booth before the opening of the National Rifle Association convention in April 2023. \n(Scott Olson / Getty)\n \nView in browser\nI made a joke on Twitter the other day that I thought deserved a better reception than it got. I was reading about Kari Lake bleating about how other Americans, if they wanted to \u201cget\u201d to Donald Trump, would have to \u201cgo through me\u201d as well as \u201cthrough 75 million Americans just like me \u2026 most of us are card-carrying members of the NRA.\u201d I said that Lake\u2019s political career was like the origin story of Jonathan Matthias.\nI made that joke because I\u2019m a nerd and I\u2019m old. Matthias is the bad guy from the classic 1971 Charlton Heston movie \nThe Omega Man\n,\n \na postapocalyptic thriller in which almost everyone in the world is wiped out by a germ-warfare disaster. Heston has an antidote; the other survivors end up as light-sensitive ghouls that can go out only at night. Matthias (played by the legendary character actor \nAnthony Zerbe\n) was, before the plague, a blustery celebrity television newscaster, and he later uses his charisma to organize his fellow sorta-vampires into a cult built around hating Heston and all modern technology.\nIt\u2019s less funny if you have to explain it, but the idea of Kari Lake going from television anchor to cult leader after a pandemic seemed pretty on the nose, and her whole Grand Guignol act is so close to Zerbe\u2019s melodramatic thundering that I couldn\u2019t resist.\nBut maybe the joke isn\u2019t that funny. Lake may be inane, but insofar as any of her followers believe that she\u2019s issuing a call to action, she is also dangerous. She\u2019s not alone; after news of Trump\u2019s indictment broke, two of the most disgraceful members of Congress, Andy Biggs and Clay Higgins, essentially called for open conflict with their fellow citizens. \u201cWe have now reached a war phase,\u201d Biggs \ntweeted\n on Friday. \u201cEye for an eye,\u201d he added, going full Hammurabi.\nHiggins, meanwhile, issued a tweet of paramilitary \nbabble\n:\nPresident Trump said he has \u201cbeen summoned to appear at the Federal Courthouse in Miami on Tuesday, at 3 PM.\u201d\nThis is a perimeter probe from the oppressors. Hold. rPOTUS has this.\nBuckle up. 1/50K know your bridges. Rock steady calm. That is all.\nAs Jeff Sharlet \nwrote\n in \nThe Atlantic\n this weekend, Higgins is trying to sound like a militia commander, issuing orders to his troops on behalf of \u201crPOTUS,\u201d or the \u201creal president of the United States.\u201d\nMy first reaction to both of those tweets was basically: \nWhatever, \nSgt. Rock\n.\n \nBut perhaps that\u2019s not enough. Trump and his cult followers, especially those in public life, have made threats of violence a routine part of the American political environment. (I have received many such threats over the years that I\u2019ve been writing about Trump.) Notice, for example, how Trump has gone out of his way to name Special Counsel Jack Smith\u2019s wife: Trump knows that Smith is a tough prosecutor who has dealt with some hard characters and is unlikely to fear a \nweak man\n like Donald Trump, so he put Smith\u2019s wife in the public eye\u2014and in the crosshairs of his supporters. It\u2019s become commonplace to say this is \nMafia-like behavior\n, but that\u2019s something of an insult to the old-school Mafiosi who generally left family members alone when settling their beefs.\nAs Sharlet noted, Trump\u2019s most violent supporters are not nearly the majority they think they are, so there\u2019s no point in fear-driven hysteria. Nevertheless, such people can be dangerous not only to their fellow citizens but to the constitutional order itself, by inducing anxiety about democracy among ordinary citizens and potential office seekers, as well as a reluctance to speak out and participate in our system of government. (Also, it takes \nstartlingly few\n individuals who are willing to commit acts of violence to do real damage.)\nSo maybe what we need is a solid balance of vigilance and scorn. National politicians gibbering their own down-home versions of \u201cHail Hydra\u201d should be an ongoing scandal: Such behavior is un-American, and every supporter of American democracy should respond with the self-assured contempt that free people must bestow on the aspiring authoritarians among us.\nI know that some readers will object, saying that spotlighting such behavior in the media spreads its reach, but I disagree: The nature of a hyperconnected, internet-driven society means that the kind of people who admire someone like Clay Higgins already know where to find him. Higgins knows this too, which is why he sent his message on Twitter\u2014or \u201cin the clear,\u201d as intelligence folks would say. He wasn\u2019t sending instructions to putative comrades waiting for a sign; rather, he was apparently hoping that ordinary Americans would see all this spy-speak applesauce and become fearful that hidden armies are waiting to avenge the arrest of Donald Trump.\nIn the media, every elected Republican should be asked \nevery day \nabout these threats, especially those from members of Congress, not because such questions will induce a sudden fit of conscience in Kevin McCarthy or Mitch McConnell but because after the violence of January 6, 2021, the voters have a right to know if a national political party is going to stand behind members talking about \u201cwar\u201d and pretending to issue marching orders to seditionists. (CNN\u2019s Dana Bash \ntried\n to get an answer from Representative Jim Jordan on Sunday. It went as you\u2019d expect, but at least she asked.)\nFinally, there\u2019s nothing wrong with some dismissive scorn among sensible voters. These people are not 10 feet tall. They are, in fact, small and ridiculous. (This is why I couldn\u2019t help but laugh when Lake hissed about the NRA; the hooded face of Matthias just popped into my head unbidden.) As \nI wrote\n more than a year ago, naming lunatics and shaming poltroons is essential to a healthy democracy. But the prodemocracy movement must fight with the confidence and maturity of adults:\nDitch all the coy, immature, and too-precious language about former President Donald Trump and the Republicans. No more \nGQP, \nno more \nQevin McCarthy\n, no more \nRethuglicans \nand \nRepuglicans\n. No more \nDrumpf\n. No more \nOrange Menace \n\u2026 Be the adult alternative to the bedlam around you.\nJuvenile nicknames too easily blur the distinction between prodemocracy voters and the people they\u2019re trying to defeat. If you\u2019ve ever had to endure friends or family who parrot Fox-popular terms like \nDemonrats \nand \nKillary\n and other such nonsense, think for a moment how they instantly communicated to you that you never had to take them seriously again.\nI know it\u2019s hard to find the right balance between vigilance and alarm, between scorn and flippancy; I\u2019m not always sure how to do it myself. It\u2019s a line all of us find difficult to walk, because we\u2019ve never had an American political scene so thoroughly infested with kooks, conspiracists, and would-be traitors. But remember: They are a minority, and they know it, and many of their leaders are likely more fearful\u2014of irrelevance, of change, of failure\u2014than anyone else. Take their threats seriously, but with the faith that American democracy was here before them and will be here after them.\nRelated\n:\nThe congressman telling Trump supporters to \u201cbuckle up\u201d\nThe new anarchy\nToday\u2019s News\nThe former Italian prime minister and media mogul Silvio Berlusconi, known for his polarizing politics and his role in multiple scandals, \nhas died\n at the age of 86.\nPennsylvania Governor Josh Shapiro \nhas signed\n a disaster-emergency declaration following the collapse, yesterday, of a section of I-95 in Philadelphia, which will potentially disrupt traffic in the area for months.\nUkraine says that its military \nhas reclaimed\n seven villages in the Zaporizhzhia province and the eastern Donetsk region in its first gains since it began its counteroffensive.\nDispatches\nFamous People\n:\n Lizzie and Kaitlyn manifest a \nsuccessful growing season\n for Brooklyn\u2019s crops with a garden party.\nExplore all of our newsletters here.\nEvening Read\n \n(Photo illustration by Joanne Imperio / The Atlantic)\n \nWhat Reparations Actually Bought\n \nBy\n \nMorgan Ome\n \nIn 1990, the U.S. government began mailing out envelopes, each containing a presidential letter of apology and a $20,000 check from the Treasury, to more than 82,000 Japanese Americans who, during World War II, were robbed of their homes, jobs, and rights, and incarcerated in camps. This effort, which took a decade to complete, remains a rare attempt to make reparations to a group of Americans harmed by force of law. We know how some recipients used their payment: The actor George Takei \ndonated\n his redress check to the Japanese American National Museum in Los Angeles. A former incarceree named Mae Kanazawa Hara told an interviewer in 2004 that she \nbought\n an organ for her church in Madison, Wisconsin. Nikki Nojima Louis, a playwright, told me earlier this year that she used the money to pay for living expenses while pursuing her doctorate in creative writing at Florida State University. She was 65 when she decided to go back to school, and the money enabled her to move across the country from her Seattle home.\nBut many stories could be lost to history. My family received reparations. My grandfather, Melvin, was 6 when he was imprisoned in Tule Lake, California. As long as I\u2019ve known about the redress effort, I\u2019ve wondered how he felt about getting a check in the mail decades after the war.\nRead the full article. \nMore From \nThe Atlantic\nThe three biggest obstacles to convicting Trump\nHow to fix the government\nPhilosophy could have been a lot more fun.\nCulture Break\n \n(Illustration by The Atlantic.

It\u2019s \u2026 not \ngreat\n, but it was a fun addition to Heston\u2019s run of sci-fi pictures that included \nPlanet of the Apes \nand its sequel, \nBeneath the Planet of the Apes\n (a movie that doesn\u2019t get enough love as a great sequel, in my view), as well as \nSoylent Green\n.\n \nFilmed in 1970, \nThe Omega Man \nis a strange time capsule from its era. It was set in the near future of 1977, two years after a Sino-Soviet war (which nearly \nhappened\n a few years before the movie was released) sparked the use of biological weapons and wiped out most of the planet. Heston\u2019s romance with a Black female lead\u2014\nRosalind Cash\n, in her first major movie role\u2014was pretty daring for its time. \nThe Omega Man \nwas actually the second movie based on Richard Matheson\u2019s classic 1954 novel, \nI Am Legend\n;\n \nthe first was \nThe Last Man on Earth\n in 1964, starring Vincent Price. (Frankly, both of those are better than the messy Will Smith \nremake\n released in 2007.)\nCritics did not love \nThe Omega Man\n, but then, critics didn\u2019t love much about cheesy early-1970s science fiction. It\u2019s a movie best seen at a drive-in, but because those are now mostly gone, you could do worse on a rainy afternoon than stream this one and watch Heston passing his days in a deserted Los Angeles watching the documentary \nWoodstock\n over and over (no, really) before doing battle with a bunch of technology-hating ghouls.\n\u2014 Tom\nDid someone forward you this email? \nSign up here.\nKatherine Hu contributed to this newsletter.\nMost Popular on \nThe Atlantic\nA Star Reporter\u2019s Break With Reality\nThe Vision Pro Is the Perfect Gadget for the Apocalypse\nThe Congressman Telling Trump Supporters to \u2018Buckle Up\u2019\nThe Happiest Way to Change Jobs\nLong Live the Delightfully Dumb Comedy\nThe Atlantic celebrates science, tech, and curiosity \n \nEvery great leap forward in technology\u2014be it the steam engine, the solar panel, or the AI chatbot\u2014has come from the marriage of far-flung ideas.

    "body": "Entertainment musts from Kelli Mar\u00eda Korducki \nSunday, June 11, 2023 \n \n \nIsabel Fattal\n \nSenior editor\nThis is an edition of \nThe Atlantic\n Daily, a newsletter that guides you through the biggest stories of the day, helps you discover new ideas, and recommends the best in culture. \nSign up for it here.\nGood morning, and welcome back to The Daily\u2019s Sunday culture edition, in which one \nAtlantic\n writer reveals what\u2019s keeping them entertained.\nToday\u2019s special guest is \nKelli Mar\u00eda Korducki\n, a senior editor on \nThe Atlantic\n\u2019s newsletters team (and a frequent editor of this Sunday culture newsletter). Kelli has written about the \nGoopification of AI\n, \nAmerica\u2019s adult-ADHD problem\n, and what happened when \ntax season came for the crypto bros\n. Kelli is awaiting the release of a \u201cvery Salvadoran American\u201d comedy from the director Julio Torres\u2014her self-proclaimed \u201cdiasporic ambassador\u201d\u2014and rediscovering the pure joys of social media (but not TikTok).\nFirst, here are three Sunday reads from \nThe Atlantic\n:\nWhy is everyone watching TV with the subtitles on?\nMoneyball broke baseball.\nThe immortal Mel Brooks\nThe Culture Survey: Kelli Mar\u00eda Korducki\n \nThe 1990s \"queen of the indies\" Parker Posey in a promotional image for \nParty Girl\n \n(First Look Pictures / Everett Collection)\n \nView in browser\nThe upcoming event I\u2019m most looking forward to: \nI can\u2019t wait to see \nProblemista\n, Julio Torres\u2019s forthcoming (and very Salvadoran American) comedy from the premier cool-kid production studio A24, co-starring Tilda Swinton and Greta Lee. I can hardly believe I just used \u201cSalvadoran American\u201d and \u201cforthcoming comedy\u201d in the same sentence.\nI share Torres\u2019s Salvadoran heritage\u2014my mom and her immediate family immigrated to the U.S. in the 1980s and \u201990s\u2014and the only Salvadoran character I can remember from any semi-recent pop-culture product is Cher\u2019s maid, Lucy, in \nClueless \n(1995), whose brief appearance ends with her \ndeclaration\n \u201cI\u2019m not a Mexican!\u201d; I remember first seeing that scene and thinking, \nRight on!\n In true minority-group-within-a-minority-group fashion, I\u2019ve made peace with the reality that even if an average, non-Salvadoran American has heard of my familial homeland and can place it on a map, there\u2019s still a nonzero chance that their associations with the country will be limited to gangs, civil war, Bitcoin, and \npupusas\n. Which is darkly hilarious in and of itself, I suppose. Anyway, I\u2019m so proud to claim Torres as my diasporic ambassador. I think he\u2019s a genius.\nThe best novel I\u2019ve recently read, and the best work of nonfiction: \nI\u2019ve been using the word \nfun\n to describe Catherine Lacey\u2019s \nBiography of X\n, which might be a puzzling word choice to others who have read it. It\u2019s a fictional biography, an alternate history, and a mishmash of decontextualized (or rather, recontextualized) cultural ephemera that piece together the story of a deceased artist\u2019s secret life. Reading it, though, I cared less about the characters and their motivations than about how the story would come together; Lacey\u2019s exhaustively footnoted meta-narrative appeals to my own journalistic urge to catalog and go down rabbit holes. It seems like it was a blast to write. \n[Related: \nThis novelist is pushing all the buttons at the same time.\n]\nAs for nonfiction, I\u2019m currently enjoying Darryl Pinckney\u2019s \nCome Back in September\n;\n \nI just pilfered a review copy from \nThe Atlantic\n\u2019s New York office (I\u2019ll return it, I swear). It ticks off a lot of my personal, maybe-pretentious boxes: an autobiography of creative life, intellectual mentorship, the coming-together of the right people at the right moment, 1970s New York. I love reading about bygone cultural scenes, kismet frozen in amber. I\u2019m a sucker for nostalgia.\n [Related: \nThe writer\u2019s most sacred relationship\n]\nSomething I recently revisited: \nNot too long ago, I rewatched \nGhost World\n, the 2001 film adapted from the Daniel Clowes \ngraphic novel\n. I loved the movie in high school and strongly identified with Enid, its nonconformist teen protagonist\u2014for a time, I even wore my hair in Enid\u2019s bottle-black bob and had similar vintage cat\u2019s-eye glasses frames fitted with my prescription. I remembered the movie for its humor and world-building. Twenty-odd years later, I noticed, for the first time, its poignancy. What younger me saw as an offbeat coming-of-age story was now a parable about misfits aching for connection in a world they can\u2019t help but chafe against. The teenage rule-bucker within me still relates, but the 30-something understands the stakes. \n[Related: \nGhost World \nendures for its cynicism\u2014and pathos.\n \n(From 2017)\n]\nMy favorite way of wasting time on my phone:\n I\u2019ve always had a love-hate relationship with social media (very unique, I know). I was a relatively early adopter of Twitter, a \nvery \nearly adopter of Facebook, and a somewhat late Instagram joiner. From the get-go, I\u2019ve vacillated between anxious overuse and total neglect of these three platforms. But lately, I\u2019ve found a groove\u2014I\u2019m remembering that Instagram isn\u2019t just a place for stalking acquaintances and feeling terrible about my comparably boring life; it\u2019s also a legitimately useful tool for sharing what I\u2019m up to and keeping in touch with my geographically scattered friends and family in a reciprocal way. Being an older Millennial does have its perks; we still have a genuinely social web. The youths are \nmissing out\n!\nAs for Twitter: The product bugginess that followed \nElon Musk\u2019s takeover\n of the company (and which continues, despite his recent passing of the CEO torch) has, in my opinion, rekindled some of the chaos that made early Twitter so fun. Although I wouldn\u2019t go so far as to suggest that Musk\u2019s Twitter era has been great for society\u2014you can read more about that bigger picture \nhere\n\u2014my feed has somehow become more pleasant, albeit in a slightly unhinged way. I see fewer posts that are clearly written for the purpose of maximizing engagement (\nso \nlame) and more stream-of-consciousness riffing. There\u2019s more interaction for its own sake, versus pure performance. I\u2019ve been enjoying the platform more lately than I had been for years.\nAnd TikTok? No offense to theater-kid energy, but that\u2019ll be a nope for me. I prefer to keep enjoying the occasional video in the sensible old-person way\u2014through other people\u2019s curation on the platforms I actually use.\nThe last thing that made me snort with laughter: \nLast month, I attended a brunch screening of the new 4K restoration of \nParty Girl\n, the 1995 cult comedy starring the \u201990s\u2019 \u201cqueen of the indies\u201d Parker Posey as an aimless lower-Manhattan scenester who gets a job as a library clerk, drinks the proverbial Dewey Decimal Kool-Aid, falls for a Lebanese schoolteacher turned falafel-cart peddler, and decides to turn her life around and become a librarian. I love everything about this movie\u2014the fashion is divine, and its glimpses of New York\u2019s then-gentrifying downtown capture a moment lost in time. Apparently, the film \nis beloved\n, \nby those in the know\n, for its \nincredibly accurate portrayal of the library-science\n field. But ultimately, this is Parker Posey\u2019s star vehicle. Her \nface\n has perfect comedic timing. I dare you to watch \nthis scene\n (or \nthis one\n) without letting out a snort or two.\nRead past editions of the Culture Survey with \nEmma Sarappo\n, \nAdam Harris\n, \nSaahil Desai\n, \nYasmin Tayag\n, \nDamon Beres\n, \nJulie Beck\n, and \nFaith Hill\n.\nThe Week Ahead\nReproduction\n, a new novel by Louisa Hall, examines the surreality and hazard of childbirth through the perspective of a novelist-protagonist attempting to write a book about Mary Shelley (on sale Tuesday).\nThe Flash\n,\n \na DC superhero film that\u2014despite the \u201cmountain of disturbing allegations against its star\u201d\u2014manages to be \u201cbreezy and charming,\u201d our critic \nwrites\n (in theaters Friday)\nSwiping America\n, an eight-episode \u201cromantic documentary\u201d dating series that follows four New York City singles on blind dates across eight American cities (first two episodes begin streaming Thursday on Max)\nEssay\n \n(Illustration by Lucas Burtin)\n \nInside Frank Bascombe\u2019s Head, Again\n \nBy\n \nAdam Begley\n \nHalf a century ago, at the 1974 Adelaide Festival of Arts, in South Australia, John Updike delivered a muscular manifesto: \u201cWe must write where we stand,\u201d he said. \u201cAn imitation of the life we know, however narrow, is our only ground.\u201d His call for accurate and specific witness, for a realism dedicated to the here and now, was surely in part an apology for the repeat appearances of Harry \u201cRabbit\u201d Angstrom, the former high-school-basketball star Updike called his \u201cticket to the America all around me.\u201d Already the hero of \nRabbit, Run\n (1960) and \nRabbit Redux\n (1971), Harry was destined to star in two more alliterative Rabbit novels, \nRabbit Is Rich\n (1981) and \nRabbit at Rest\n (1990), as well as the postmortem novella \nRabbit Remembered\n (2000).

    "subject": "Trump\u2019s indictment reveals a national-security nightmare",
    "body": "Plus: The immortal Mel Brooks \nFriday, June 9, 2023 \n \n \nTom Nichols\n \nStaff writer\nFormer President Donald Trump, along with one of his aides, has been indicted for federal crimes involving highly sensitive national-security documents. Trump and his enablers are already trying to brush the charges away as the result of a witch hunt over a minor issue, but this indictment shows why Trump was, and remains, a threat to national security.\nFirst, here are four new stories from \nThe Atlantic\n:\nThe immortal Mel Brooks\nWomen aren\u2019t just small men.\nNew York failed the smoke test.\nHow lifeguards lost their luster\nDefiant Recklessness\n \nIn a handout photo provided by the U.S. Department of Justice, stacks of boxes are seen in a bathroom and shower in the Mar-a-Lago Club\u2019s Lake Room at former President Donald Trump\u2019s estate in Palm Beach, Florida. \n(U.S. Department of Justice via Getty)\n \nView in browser\nSpecial Counsel Jack Smith has successfully petitioned to unseal the indictment of Donald Trump and his aide Walt Nauta on multiple charges revolving around Trump\u2019s removal of classified material from the White House and his belligerent refusal to return them. The charges \ninclude\n making false statements, conspiracy to obstruct justice, withholding and concealing records, and willful retention of national defense information in violation of the Espionage Act.\nWhen Trump learned of the indictment yesterday, he and his devoted coterie of Republican apologists, \nincluding\n House Speaker Kevin McCarthy, got right to work trying to minimize the charges as a politically motivated \u201cweaponization\u201d of the law. Even Florida Governor Ron DeSantis, who (at least in theory) is running \nagainst\n Trump, felt the need \nto side\n with the most notorious Florida Man now facing justice. As my colleague David Frum \nnotes\n, this is about as sincere as the grief at a Mafia funeral, but the fact that DeSantis and others feel the need to placate such paranoia is indicative of how unhinged the GOP base has become.\nSmith, however, isn\u2019t pussyfooting around: The charges\u201438 of them\u2014are a big deal. And before the GOP gaslighting reaches supernova levels, let\u2019s also bear in mind that what Trump actually \ndid \nis a big deal too. He claimed that he declassified, by fiat, boxes of classified information, and then appears to have left all of that material sitting in ballrooms, bedrooms, and bathrooms. To this day, he insists that he had every right to do whatever he wanted with America\u2019s secrets. Fortunately, the court has unsealed the indictment, because Americans need to know, and care, about the magnitude of Trump\u2019s alleged offenses.\nTo understand the severity of the charges against Trump, consider a thought experiment: Imagine that Vladimir Putin is one day driven from the Kremlin, perhaps in a coup or in the face of a popular revolt. He jumps into his limousine and heads for self-imposed exile in a remote dacha. His trunk is full of secret documents that he decided belong to him, including details of the Russian nuclear deterrent and Russia\u2019s \nmilitary weaknesses\n.\nNow imagine how valuable those boxes would be to any intelligence organization in the world. I spent the early years of my career analyzing Soviet and Russian documents as an academic Sovietologist, and I would have loved to see such materials. Small, seemingly trivial details\u2014something as innocuous as a desk calendar or a notepad\u2014might not mean much to a layperson, but to a professional, they could be pure gold. To get even a peek at such Russian materials would be an intelligence triumph.\nBut of course, I would never have been able to lay my hands on them, because a cache of such immense importance, if U.S. operatives spirited any of it out of Russia, would have been secured in a vault somewhere deep in the CIA. Trump, meanwhile, left highly sensitive American documents lying around at a golf resort like practice balls on the driving range. According to the indictment:\nThe Mar-a-Lago Club was an active social club, which, between January 2021 and August 2022, hosted events for tens of thousands of members and guests. After TRUMP\u2019s presidency, The Mar-a-Lago Club was not an authorized location for the storage, possession, review, display, or discussion of classified documents. Nevertheless, TRUMP stored his boxes containing classified documents in various locations at The Mar-a-Lago Club\u2014including in a ballroom, a bathroom and shower, an office space, his bedroom, and a storage room.\nActually, it might be harder to steal practice balls. \u201cThe Storage Room,\u201d the indictment notes, \u201cwas near the liquor supply closet, linen room, lock shop, and various other rooms.\u201d These are not exactly low-traffic areas. Worse yet, the indictment asserts that Trump had some of these documents at his club in New Jersey, where he showed files to people who had no business seeing them. (One of them, according to the indictment, was something Trump claimed was a plan of attack on a foreign country prepared for him by the Department of Defense and a senior military official.)\nNormally, when there is spillage of classified material\u2014and such events are common, including during presidential transitions\u2014it\u2019s treated much like the spillage of toxic waste: Even if it\u2019s an accident, everyone involved must cooperate to find the source of the spill, evaluate the amount of danger, and contain and clean the area. What Trump has already \nadmitted \nto doing\u2014taking classified documents and then defying the U.S. government\u2019s repeated demands to return them\u2014is like driving off with a truckload of toxic chemicals, splashing them around, and then, when the guys in the hazmat suits show up, telling them he had every right to dump out the barrels on his own property and that they can go take a hike.\nJudging from the indictment (and its damning photographs), Trump did all of this while leaving some of the most tempting intelligence targets in the Western world open to theft or reproduction. The indictment is both astounding and horrifying, with pictures of classified materials sitting in unsecured boxes around Mar-a-Lago, that could give hives to anyone who\u2019s ever held a security clearance (as I did for most of my adult life). At this point, we may never know who saw what, or which documents are now in the hands of our enemies. In any decent democracy, this intentional and defiant recklessness with classified material would be added to the list of acts that should prohibit Trump from ever holding any position of government responsibility ever again.\nTrump\u2019s enablers, however, will try to set the agenda, just as they did when Special Counsel Robert Mueller filed his report in 2019 on Trump\u2019s alleged collusion with the Russians. Back then, Attorney General William Barr performed a major act of civic sabotage by \nbowdlerizing Mueller\u2019s findings\n before anyone saw the actual report. I was in Switzerland at the time, and when a daily newspaper back in the United States asked me to write about the report, all I had to go on was Barr\u2019s version; although I suspected that the full truth \nwas worse\n, I could \nwrite\n only from what I had at the moment\u2014which is exactly what \nBarr intended\n.\nTrump-supporting Republicans are attempting to replicate Barr\u2019s dishonest play by convincing Americans that Joe Biden and Merrick Garland have personally indicted Trump over a nothingburger. Like many who have commented on the documents fiasco, McCarthy, \nElise Stefanik\n, \nJosh Hawley\n, and others must know that this is a flat lie, but it\u2019s a lie that will work on millions of people. Smith and the government of the United States have made clear that Donald Trump has yet again betrayed his country. The rest of us should say so to our fellow citizens\u2014and to those craven elected representatives who refuse to admit it\u2014loudly and clearly.\nRelated:\nAn exit from the GOP\u2019s labyrinth of Trump lies\nThis indictment is different.\nToday\u2019s News\nThe White House \nreleased\n intelligence indicating that Russia plans to build a drone-manufacturing plant east of Moscow using materials supplied by Iran.\nAir quality \nhas improved\n in the northeastern United States and Ontario as wildfires continue to burn in Quebec and elsewhere in Canada; firefighters from the U.S., France, and some Commonwealth nations have joined local fire crews in combating the ongoing blazes.\nRussian President Vladimir Putin said in a video interview on Friday that Russia can \n\u201cdefinitely state\u201d\n that the Ukrainian counteroffensive has begun.\nDispatches\nBooks Briefing\n: \nThe author Charles Portis was a \u201cuniquely Southern\u201d storyteller whose stories dripped with pathos and humor, Gal Beckerman \nwrites\n.\nExplore all of our newsletters here.\nEvening Read\n \n(Photo-illustration by The Atlantic.

The show, which had aired on ABC since 1963, had once been preoccupied with the titular hospital in the fictional city of Port Charles. Storylines in the \u201990s were dedicated to socially relevant topics like a teenage couple navigating the HIV/AIDS crisis, a doctor dealing with her own breast-cancer diagnosis, and an adoptee tracking down her birth mother in adulthood. But in the early aughts, the soap\u2019s gentle, humanistic notes gave way to machismo energy as it fixated on the dimpled mob don Sonny Corinthos (Maurice Benard) and those in his violence-ridden orbit. This about-face prompted the television critic Ed Martin to dub the show \u201c\nSopranos\n in the daytime.\u201d Here was the ultimate indictment: One of daytime television\u2019s crown jewels had become the Great Value knockoff of a prime-time masterwork.\nRead the full article. \nMore From \nThe Atlantic\nDon\u2019t censor racism out of the past\n.\nThe price of Title 42 is the battered bodies of my patients.\nInside Frank Bascombe\u2019s head, again\nCulture Break\n \n(Illustration by Ben Kothe / The Atlantic)\n \nRead. \nA Pale View of Hills\n, by Kazuo Ishiguro, is told by a narrator whose reliability \ncomes into question\n as the story unfolds\u2014and is eventually undone entirely by a single pronoun slip.\nWatch. \nPast Lives\n,\n \nin theaters, is a film in which distance and quiet are key to understanding a soaring intimacy.\nPlay our daily crossword.\nAdvertisement \n \n \nP.S.\nAs you can see, I am back from my vacation. Each year, I make a pilgrimage to Las Vegas; my wife and I are native New Englanders, but we have come to love the desert and the dry, clear air that gives us a break from humidity and allergies. (Every time I go to the Southwest, I think of the late Harry Anderson, playing the Boston trickster \u201cHarry the Hat\u201d on \nCheers\n \nand sneering at a competing con man from Phoenix: \u201cI was never impressed by Arizona hustlers, except they got good sinuses.\u201d) I like the noise and bustle of casinos: I play some blackjack and throw some dice, and, yes, I know the odds are against me. Shush. Let me enjoy my kitschy moment of thinking I\u2019m hanging with Frank Sinatra and Sammy Davis and Joey Bishop before their 3 a.m. show.\nSpeaking of the Rat Pack, I also love that at least a few Vegas steakhouses are trying to enforce a lost tradition: dress codes. I am a bear on this issue and always have been when it comes to fine dining. I caused a bit of consternation on Twitter when I said this the other day; there are people who think dress codes are outdated and uptight and even racist\u2014which they can be, if they are enforced selectively. Otherwise, sorry, but not sorry: No beachwear and no tank tops, thank you. No ball caps. No overly revealing clothes, please, and gentlemen must wear closed-toe shoes. And if you reek of perfectly legal cannabis, that is your right, but (at least at one famous locale) you might not be seated. The days of jackets and ties are over, but there\u2019s nothing wrong with dressing like an adult, and if you\u2019re going to hang with the memory of Dino and Sammy, and drink overpriced bourbon, the least you can do is take off your hat and show up wearing a clean shirt.\n\u2014 Tom\nDid someone forward you this email? \nSign up here.\nKelli Mar\u00eda Korducki \ncontributed to this newsletter.\nMost Popular on \nThe Atlantic\nThe Stupidest Crimes Imaginable\nWhy Is Everyone Watching TV With the Subtitles On?\nAn Exit from the GOP\u2019s Labyrinth of Trump Lies\nThe Indictment Is Stunning.

    "subject": "An interview with Tim Alberta on CNN\u2019s turmoil",
    "body": "Highlights from a \u201cRadio Atlantic\u201d conversation with the writer \nThursday, June 8, 2023 \n \n \nIsabel Fattal\n \nSenior editor\nLast Friday, \nThe Atlantic \npublished Tim Alberta\u2019s \nprofile of then\u2013CNN CEO Chris Licht.\n Yesterday, Licht was ousted from the network. Below, in selected excerpts from today\u2019s episode of our podcast \nRadio Atlantic\n, Alberta reflects on how Licht\u2019s attempts to save the network went so wrong.\nFirst, here are four new stories from \nThe Atlantic\n:\nThe true purpose of Ukraine\u2019s counteroffensive\nThe golf merger may be dead on arrival\nIs Gen Z coming for the GOP?\nThe happiest way to change jobs\nA Plan Gone Awry\n \n(Kevin Mazur / Getty Images for Warner Bros. Discovery)\n \nView in browser\nWhen Chris Licht was brought in to replace CNN\u2019s former president Jeff Zucker in 2022, he was on a mission: He wanted to rid the network of what he saw as the mistakes of the Trump era, and to welcome more Republican viewers. After spending long periods of time talking with Licht over the past year, my colleague Tim Alberta found that while Licht\u2019s theory of how to fix CNN may have made sense, the execution of that theory seemed to backfire at every turn.\nThe Atlantic \npublished \nAlberta\u2019s major profile\n of Licht last Friday. Yesterday, CNN staff learned that Licht is leaving the network. On today\u2019s \nepisode\n of our podcast \nRadio Atlantic\n, in his first (and, so far, only) interview on his reporting about Licht and CNN, Alberta joined host Hanna Rosin to discuss this week\u2019s news. Below are some highlights from their conversation.\nLicht came in with an \u201cincredibly ambitious objective.\u201d\nAfter Alberta told Rosin how hard he\u2019d worked to pitch Licht\u2019s team on this story, she wondered: Why did Alberta want to write this profile so badly? \u201cCNN had really been the poster child for Republican attacks on the media during the Trump years,\u201d he replied. \u201cI\u2019d spent as much time covering Republican voters and Republican campaigns as anybody over the past five or six years. And I\u2019d seen firsthand, time and time and time again, how, at rallies or smaller candidate events, CNN had sort of become the face of the hysterical liberal media that was out to get Trump and leading a witch hunt on his impeachment and on January 6 and on everything else.\u201d\n\u201cLicht came in and quite overtly made it known, from the beginning, that his mission was to change that perception of CNN\u2014was not to coddle the extreme right wing, so to speak, but to win back the sort of respectable rank-and-file Republican voter who had become so distrustful of CNN during those previous five or six years. And that struck me as an incredibly ambitious objective for somebody taking over one of the world\u2019s biggest news organizations \u2026 at a really sensitive time.\u201d\nLicht was an awkward fit from the start.\nLicht\u2019s network predecessor, Jeff Zucker, was a beloved, \u201clarger-than-life figure who had real personal rapport with just about everybody\u2014not only the on-air talent but the producers behind the scenes, the camera crews,\u201d Alberta explained. Licht, on the other hand, \u201cwent out of his way from the outset to be everything that Zucker wasn\u2019t. So if Zucker was warm and affectionate and intimate with everyone, Licht was sort of cold and detached, almost aloof, purposely inaccessible.\u201d\nOne of Licht\u2019s first decisions as CEO was to turn Zucker\u2019s former office\u2014on the 17th floor of the CNN building, in the heart of the network\u2019s newsroom\u2014into a conference room. He then moved himself up to an office on the 22nd floor, a spot that most employees didn\u2019t even know how to find. \u201cAnd that one move, although it seems small, I think really in many ways came to define Licht\u2019s relationship with his journalists,\u201d Alberta said.\nLicht\u2019s mission was about more than just CNN.\n\u201cThis was about the journalism industry itself,\u201d Alberta said. Licht was \u201cmaking it known that he felt that all of media had gotten played by President Trump. And he believed that if something was not done to fix that, that if there weren\u2019t dramatic measures taken to restore and rehabilitate the media\u2019s image in the eyes of much of the country, that it posed a real threat to democracy itself.\u201d\nSo what happened to that mission?\nAlberta quotes \u201cthe great philosopher Mike Tyson\u201d: \u201cEverybody has a plan until they get punched in the mouth \u2026 Chris Licht had a plan, and then he came in and he got punched in the mouth a bunch of times.\n\u201cThe recurring theme that I heard from a lot of the top talent at CNN was that, in a lot of ways, they actually agreed in theory with the mission that Chris Licht had laid out, as far as toning down some of the outrage, trying to be more selective with when they really wanted it dialed up to 11, as he would say, and go strong on certain stories,\u201d Alberta said. \u201cBut the execution of that mission was really what started to become shaky.\u201d\nOne particularly troubling question was \u201cwhat [to] do with Republicans who systematically attempted to deconstruct our democratic institutions a couple of years ago and prevent a peaceful transition of power. I mean, what do you do with those folks? Do you treat them as rational actors who need to be given a platform to reach the viewing masses?\u201d\nLicht\u2019s programming decisions sometimes seemed to answer that question in ways that conflicted with his stated vision, Alberta explained, culminating in the network\u2019s much-criticized town hall with Donald Trump last month.\nLicht seemed defeated during Alberta\u2019s final interview.\nWhen Alberta met with Licht in mid-May, a week after the Trump town hall, \u201cI could sense, having \u2026 gotten to know him fairly well over some period of time, that there was something a little bit different in his body language, that there was some self-doubt. There was maybe even a bit of sadness that things had gone so wrong.\u201d\nLooking back, did Licht\u2019s mission fail?\nAlberta pointed out that Licht set a lofty goal for himself: to reimagine the mainstream media\u2019s relationship with a Republican base that had been \u201csystematically manipulated\u201d into not trusting them for decades. \u201cIt\u2019s hard to draw any other conclusion\u201d than failure \u201cjust based on the ratings,\u201d Alberta said. \u201cOne year in the grand scheme of things is not a ton of time, but in that one year, there was just no measurable improvement. And in fact, all of the measurables actually showed that things were getting worse.\u201d\nRosin posed an important final question: \u201cMy immediate thought after hearing that he was out at CNN was, \nIn our political climate, is it even possible to do a reset like he was trying to do?\n\u201d\n\u201cI think that\u2019s the $64,000 question here, to be honest,\u201d Alberta replied. He noted that he sees some of the internet\u2019s \u201cpile on\u201d of Licht as unfair. Licht is a \u201ctalented guy\u201d who has been successful in his past roles, Alberta said, and \u201cI do think that he was dealt an exceptionally difficult hand, but I also think he made it even harder on himself than it had to be.\u201d\n\u201cI don\u2019t know if anybody at this point is capable of doing what Chris set out to do.\u201d\nListen to the full podcast episode here.\nToday\u2019s News\nIn a surprise decision, the United States Supreme Court \nruled 5\u20134\n that Alabama\u2019s current congressional map dilutes the electoral power of its Black voters, a likely violation of the Voting Rights Act.\nFederal prosecutors handling the investigation into former President Donald Trump\u2019s possession of classified documents\n were spotted\n at a Miami courthouse where a grand jury has been hearing witness testimony, further evidence of a potential indictment.\nThe Baptist minister Pat Robertson, founder of the Christian Broadcasting Network and an influential coalition of conservative Christians, \nhas died\n at the age of 93.

    "body": "Plus: Read our profile of former CNN CEO Chris Licht. \nWednesday, June 7, 2023 \n \nThis First\nThis morning, five days after \nThe\n \nAtlantic\n published a profile of then\u2013CNN CEO Chris Licht by staff writer Tim Alberta, the CEO of Warner Bros. Discovery announced that Licht would be leaving CNN immediately. \nRead the profile here.\n \nIsabel Fattal\n \nSenior editor\nAbout 75 million people across the country \nare\n under air-quality alerts. Below is a brief guide to what comes next, and what this moment explains about our warming planet.\nFirst, here are three more recent stories from \nThe Atlantic\n:\nChris Licht\u2019s fundamental mistake\nThe next crisis will start with empty office buildings.\nFrench people are fighting over giant pools of water.\nSurreal Skies\n \nThe Ed Koch Queensboro Bridge in New York City on June 7 \n(Eduardo Munoz Alvarez / Getty)\n \nView in browser\nIn much of the northern United States and parts of Canada, a look outside the window right now might paint a more vivid picture of the current reality than any news article can. Wildfire smoke from Canada is spreading south over many regions of the Midwest, Ohio Valley, the Northeast, and the mid-Atlantic. Midtown Manhattan has been \norange\n. About 75 million people across the country \nare\n under air-quality alerts. Here\u2019s what to know about how to protect yourself, what comes next, and what this moment explains about our warming planet.\nAir-quality levels pose health threats ranging from small to serious.\nLet\u2019s start with some context: Good air quality lands from 0 to 50 on the \nAir Quality Index\n (AQI), which measures the density of air pollutants such as carbon monoxide and particulates. Any air-quality level higher than 100 \ncan cause\n health issues for people at risk, such as children, the elderly, and those with asthma or lung diseases; air-quality levels higher than 150 can cause problems for even healthy people. As of 4 p.m. EST today, the New York City metro area had reached \nan AQI\n of 413, falling within the \u201chazardous\u201d category.\nThe research on health effects from wildfire-smoke exposure in particular is not expansive, but evidence \nsuggests\n links between exposure and various health effects, both cardiovascular and respiratory. Wildfire smoke contains small particulate-matter pollutants; when these are inhaled, they can get into the lungs and \nmay\n enter the bloodstream. For healthy people without underlying medical conditions, brief exposure will likely not cause more than temporary irritation, but such levels of exposure are concerning for vulnerable people and those with certain health issues\u2014and prolonged exposure is concerning for all people.\nSo what can you do while waiting this out? Experts suggest that you stay inside as much as possible, and keep windows and doors closed. If you have a window air conditioner, check that the unit is recirculating air from indoors instead of pulling air from outside. And as my colleague Katherine J. Wu \nreported today\n, wearing an N95 mask that fits flush against your face can help minimize the particles inhaled when you\u2019re outside, but your cloth mask probably won\u2019t do very much (although it\u2019s better than not covering up at all).\nA new wind pattern is expected to improve air quality in some areas this weekend.\nHow long this level of air quality will last in the northeastern U.S. depends on wind direction. Today into tomorrow, an even worse round of wildfire smoke could move south out of Canada and hit Pennsylvania, New York State, and the mid-Atlantic. But starting on Friday, the winds are \nexpected to\n change direction, which experts \npredict\n should keep new smoke from moving south from Canada.\nThe time and location of Canada\u2019s wildfires are highly unusual.\nMatthew Cappucci, a meteorologist for Capital Weather Gang, and Jason Samenow, \nThe Washington Post\n\u2019s weather editor, \nexplained\n yesterday that though wildfires are somewhat normal across Canada and the western United States in the summer, \u201coutbreaks as widespread and numerous as these are virtually unheard of in late May into June. The amount of smoke pouring into the Northeast is thus also exceptional.\u201d\nAnd these wildfires are a clear effect of climate change.\nCappucci and Samenow explain:\nWhile wildfires can be sparked in many different ways, the rapidity with which they spread is proportional to how hot and dry the ambient environment is. There exists a strong link between the frequency and intensity of heat domes and human-caused climate change. A number of high-end heat domes have already fostered wildfire outbreaks across Canada this year, and more appear to be in the offing.\nWildfire hot spots may soon pop up in unexpected places.\nA wet winter and cool spring curbed wildfire potential in parts of the West, but experts \nanticipate\n that warmer, drier conditions in America\u2019s northern tier will drive new fire risks this summer, particularly in the Great Lakes states.\nAnd eventually, parts of the East Coast may catch up. As the climate reporter Kendra Pierre-Louis \nwrote\n in \nThe Atlantic\n last year, \u201cthe Northeast is now primed for more frequent droughts that will harm agriculture, intermittently reduce drinking-water supplies, and increase wildfire risk. The East will not emerge unscathed from the infernos that are quickly becoming a hallmark of western summers.\u201d\nRelated: \nPhotos: Smoke from Canada\u2019s wildfires drifts south\nThe not-COVID reason to mask is here.\nWant to get our latest climate-change coverage in your inbox? \nSign up\n for The Weekly Planet.\nToday\u2019s News\nFormer Vice President Mike Pence \nofficially launched\n his campaign for the Republican presidential nomination, in which he denounced former President Donald Trump for his role in the January 6 attacks.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\nUkrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky\n told the German newspaper \nBild\n that Russian forces are shooting at Ukrainian rescuers in parts of occupied Kherson, where flooding from the collapsed Nova Kakhovka dam has trapped residents.\nThe Argentine soccer star Lionel Messi \nsaid\n that he plans to sign with the Major League Soccer club Inter Miami.\nDispatches\nWork in Progress\n: \nThe next crisis will start with empty office buildings, \nDror Poleg writes\n.\nExplore all of our newsletters here.\nEvening Read\n \n(Carolina Moscoso)\n \nIt\u2019s 5 a.m. Somewhere\n \nBy\n \nRachel Sugar\n \nJFK Terminal 8\u2014It is 9:22 a.m., and I am learning about consumer protections from a food-safety inspector who is on her second Bloody Mary. There is nothing quite like alcohol to facilitate an expansive conversation: I should encourage young people, she tells me, to consider careers in food safety. She\u2019s on her way back from a work trip, and I learn that she always drinks Bloody Marys when she travels, which is often, but never drinks them at home. We move on to other topics: reincarnation, ExxonMobil, karma, the state of labor unions. The only thing that seemed to be off limits was her full name (her job, she said, prevents her from speaking with the media).\nWe\u2019re sitting in the New York Sports Bar across from Gate 10, which is next to Solstice Sunglasses and a vending machine selling ready-to-eat salads in plastic mason jars. In the corner, two blond women drink white wine. A passing traveler pops her head in: Does the bar serve French fries? The bartender says no, they don\u2019t start serving French fries until 10:30. It is too early for French fries.

    "body": "Two possible post-smartphone futures \nTuesday, June 6, 2023 \n \n \nDamon Beres\n \nSenior editor\nApple\u2019s recently unveiled Vision Pro presents an all-screen future, but generative AI\u2019s growth in recent months has also hinted at ways we might move toward the opposite experience. What will our tech look like in 50 years?\nFirst, here are three new stories from \nThe Atlantic\n:\nInside baseball\u2019s desperate effort to save itself from irrelevance\nWhy is everyone watching TV with the subtitles on?\nPhones at schools are a disaster.\nBeyond Four Corners\n \n(Apple)\n \nView in browser\nIf I am lucky, I will still be alive some 40 or 50 years from now\u2014a senior citizen in an easy chair reliving my son\u2019s birthdays, graduations, and wedding through a 3-D video playback on a thin piece of glass hovering just in front of my eyes. Another possibility, depending on how technology develops, is that I\u2019ll speak aloud to a robotic simulacrum that\u2019s loaded with the latest generative-AI software and trained on decades of his audio and text messages. It seems certain, in any case, that I won\u2019t be looking at a smartphone.\nWe may one day remember 2023 as the moment when the world started to bend toward one of these two futures, each of them a divergence from the era of glass-and-metal bricks that the original iPhone ushered in nearly 16 years ago. Yesterday, Apple unveiled a $3,499 headset called the Vision Pro that will engulf your field of view in pure screen. The company pitched the device in part with a marketing video that shows a man wearing the thing alone on a couch, flipping through photos and videos of his children that float a few feet away in his dark living room. (It would be a shattering evocation of divorce if you didn\u2019t briefly see his wedding band.)\nAlthough the Vision Pro has a lot in common with virtual-reality products that have existed for years, it features a uniquely Apple twist\u2014one that may prove crucial in normalizing the gadget for the very many people who, until now, have shown zero interest in grafting a personal computer to their brow. If you want to engage with the outside world while you wear the headset, it will display footage of your eyes on an \nexternal\n screen, an effect that makes the Vision Pro look almost like a transparent pair of goggles. As I wrote \nyesterday\n, the idea is to minimize the barrier that the technology might present:\nThe look is disquietingly cyborg, but the selling point is clear. We live our lives in digital space but also outside of it. Picture the thin pane of glass between you and this article simply vanishing. This is, it seems, an attempt for Apple to have its cake and eat it too. You\u2019ll wear a computer on your face, sure, but you can still exist in real life, talk to your family, kick a soccer ball.\nThis is the all-screen future: Apple\u2019s \npromotional video\n shows the Vision Pro being used in tandem with the Apple Watch and a MacBook, but not the iPhone, suggesting that \nthis \nis the future of mobile technology. You don\u2019t need the small rectangle: You need your entire universe to be a screen.\nBut recent months have also hinted at ways we might move toward the opposite experience. AI, you might have heard, is getting pretty good: The path forward might involve digital assistants that listen and speak, replacing the old paradigm of punching queries into an on-screen search engine or text-message box.\nIt might also involve stranger outcomes. Last November, OpenAI released ChatGPT, a program that responds to queries with startling coherence. Trained on an \nunimaginable volume of text\n, the application clarified unlike anything else how generative AI might disrupt digital life as we\u2019ve known it. These large-language models might \naugment\n or replace \nhuman work\n, flood the internet with \ngray-goo content\n, or revolutionize the creation and distribution of \ndisinformation\n. As my colleague Adrienne LaFrance \ndescribed\n:\nWe may see whole categories of labor, and in some cases entire industries, wiped away with startling speed. The utopians among us will view this revolution as an opportunity to outsource busywork to machines for the higher purpose of human self-actualization. This new magic could indeed create more time to be spent on matters more deserving of our attention\u2014deeper quests for knowledge, faster routes to scientific discovery, extra time for leisure and with loved ones. It may also lead to \nwidespread unemployment\n and the loss of professional confidence as a more competent AI looks over our shoulder.\nWith all of this in mind, I\u2019ve wondered if the supposed \nAI apocalypse\n wouldn\u2019t mean the destruction of humanity but instead a crisis of trust. Generative AI is known to \u201c\nhallucinate\n,\u201d or confidently present false information as true. Combined with the gray goo, the supercharged fake news, and the potential for our personal data to be turned against us in \nalarming new ways\n, AI might turn us away from screens\u2014even ones that rest on our face\u2014simply because we cannot fully believe anything they show us. Human-to-human interactions, unmediated by technology, may become the norm once again.\nReality is unlikely to map perfectly onto these scenarios. But there\u2019s clearly an urge\u2014from Big Tech and its many subjects\u2014to imagine a world beyond the four corners of a handheld screen. History is long; the smartphone era could, and even likely will, seem to be a blip in retrospect. So much can change. Perhaps it\u2019s starting to now.\nRelated:\nThe age of goggles has arrived.\nOne more screen for your face\nToday\u2019s News\nA dam in southern Ukraine has collapsed, \nflooding villages\n in both Russian- and Ukrainian-controlled areas.

Playing a prerelease version of \nDiablo IV\n, the latest installment in a 26-year-old adventure series about battling the forces of hell, I faced swarms of demons that yowled and belched. My character, a sorcerer, shot them with lightning bolts, producing a jet-engine roar. I jabbed buttons arrhythmically\u2014\nclick\n \u2026 \nclick\n \u2026 \nclickclickclick\n\u2014while trying to stifle curses and whimpers. But the strangest sounds came from the two \nDiablo IV\n designers who sat alongside me.

Below, I explore the fraught nature of \u201cdressing for the job you want\u201d on the campaign trail.\nFirst, here are three new stories from \nThe Atlantic\n:\nThe murder rate is suddenly falling.\nGet rid of the debt ceiling once and for all.\nHow parking ruined everything\nAmericana Cosplay\n \nFormer Vice President Mike Pence rolls into Des Moines, Iowa on a Harley-Davidson, June 3, 2023. \n(Scott Olson / Getty)\n \nView in browser\nOne of the most memorable scenes from HBO\u2019s political satire \nVeep\n is an unsettlingly realistic \ncampaign spot\n. Jonah Ryan, a WASPy, weaselly Capitol Hill aide, attempts to rebrand himself as an everyman when he runs for Congress. In lieu of his navy blazer and khakis, Jonah dons a flannel shirt and a puffy vest, and chops wood (poorly). He looks uncomfortable merely holding the axe, let alone swinging it.\nI thought of Jonah this past weekend as former Vice President Mike Pence rolled into Des Moines, Iowa, straddling a Harley-Davidson. Pence mugged for the cameras in a black leather vest, jeans, and cowboy boots. To be fair, Pence was the only presidential candidate who actually rode a motorcycle to Senator Joni Ernst\u2019s annual \u201cRoast and Ride\u201d charity glad-handing event, so he deserves a little bit of credit. But the photos were, well, \nquite funny\n. Pence has spent years cultivating a distinct personal image\u2014that of a stoic, soft-spoken churchgoer who never has a hair out of place. Picture Dennis Hopper in \nEasy Rider\n, then imagine his exact opposite: \nThat\u2019s\n Pence.\nStill \u2026 at least he didn\u2019t autograph a Bible! Governor Ron DeSantis of Florida was also in Iowa this past weekend, and he graciously signed someone\u2019s copy of the good book. (His wife, Casey, was photographed in her own motorcycle leather, adorned with an image of Florida, a gator, and the phrase \u201cWhere Woke Goes to Die.\u201d She and her husband took an SUV, not a hog, to the event.)\nAs his campaign gets under way, DeSantis is also undergoing a Jonah-like evolution. He holds degrees from Harvard and Yale, yet he\u2019s still learning basic retail-politics skills. My colleague Mark Leibovich recently observed DeSantis up close on the trail in New Hampshire. While working the rope line at an American Legion hall, DeSantis \u201csmiled for the camera like the dentist had just asked him to bite down on a blob of putty; like he was trying to make a mold, or to fit one,\u201d \nLeibovich wrote\n.\nTo be sure, the performative \u201cI\u2019m just like you\u201d campaign pitch is by no means a purely Republican phenomenon. Remember in 2015, when Hillary Clinton informed us that she was \n\u201cjust chillin\u2019 in Cedar Rapids\u201d\n? Or way back in 2003, when John Kerry tried to court Philadelphia voters by visiting the divey cheesesteak mecca Pat\u2019s and doomed his campaign by asking for \nSwiss cheese instead of Whiz\n?\nIn the last presidential election cycle, after being dogged by accusations of hiding from the coronavirus pandemic in his basement, Joe Biden released his own how-do-you-like-me-now campaign ad. As an electric guitar strummed in the background, Biden revved the engine of his convertible Corvette Stingray, then tore off down what looked like a very safe private road, ostensibly in support of an electric-vehicle future. The spot unintentionally called to mind the 2009 \nOnion\n headline \u201c\nShirtless Biden Washes Trans Am in White House Driveway\n.\u201d\nI asked my colleague Amanda Mull, who spent 10 years in the fashion industry and writes about consumerism, why presidential candidates lean into the same form of \u00fcber-Americana year after year. \u201cPolitics is a strange industry full of fundamentally strange people who mostly don\u2019t quite realize how odd they are,\u201d she said.\nShe went on, \u201cThis working-man Americana cosplay is, on some level, an acknowledgement that politicians exist separately from regular people, and it\u2019s an attempt to bridge a gap on an aesthetic level that they are incapable of bridging interpersonally. But they\u2019re weird guys, so the end result is the exact opposite\u2014they look so uncomfortable, so uncanny in their little jeans and boots, that they might as well have just landed from outer space.\u201d\nThe current Republican front-runner, Donald Trump, skipped Iowa altogether this past weekend, but rest assured, he\u2019s been busy doing his own pandering. Last week, Trump proposed a yearlong \n\u201cSalute to America 250\u201d\n party to be held at the Iowa state fairgrounds in celebration of the country\u2019s coming semiquincentennial in 2026. \u201cTogether we will build it, and they will come,\u201d Trump proclaimed. You could virtually smell the rising corn.\nRelated:\nRon DeSantis\u2019s joyless ride\nWhy won\u2019t Trump\u2019s rivals just say it?\nToday\u2019s News\nA sonic boom was heard in the D.C. area after \nmilitary jets scrambled\n to respond to a private flight crossing into restricted airspace. The plane was determined not to be a threat.\nThe California attorney general \nis investigating\n whether a group of migrants that, on Friday, was flown to California on a private plane was sent by the state of Florida, calling it \u201cstate-sanctioned kidnapping.\u201d\nThe U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission \nhas sued\n Binance, the world\u2019s largest crypto exchange, on allegations that the company is mishandling customer funds and lying to regulators and investors.\nEvening Read\n \n(Illustration by Jo Imperio)\n \nIn Defense of Humanity\n \nBy\n \nAdrienne LaFrance\n \nOn July 13, 1833, during a visit to the Cabinet of Natural History at the Jardin des Plantes, in Paris, Ralph Waldo Emerson had an epiphany. Peering at the museum\u2019s specimens\u2014butterflies, hunks of amber and marble, carved seashells\u2014he felt overwhelmed by the interconnectedness of nature, and humankind\u2019s place within it.\nThe experience inspired him to write \u201c\nThe Uses of Natural History\n,\u201d and to articulate a philosophy that put naturalism at the center of intellectual life in a technologically chaotic age\u2014guiding him, along with the collective of writers and radical thinkers known as transcendentalists, to a new spiritual belief system. Through empirical observation of the natural world, Emerson believed, anyone could become \u201c\na definer and map-maker\n of the latitudes and longitudes of our condition\u201d\u2014finding agency, individuality, and wonder in a mechanized age.\nRead the full article. \nMore From \nThe Atlantic\nSix books that feel like puzzles\nNo one knows what \u201crace neutral\u201d admissions looks like.\nSuper-rare angel sharks are thriving in a fake beach full of tourists.\nCulture Break\n \n(Inge Morath / Magnum)\n \nRead.\n A \nnew collection\n of Charles Portis\u2019s work \nmakes the case\n for his place in the American canon.\nListen.\n The \nnewest episode\n of the \nHow to Talk to People\n podcast discusses what we owe our friends in a culture that prioritizes romance.\nPlay our daily crossword.\nAdvertisement \n \n \nP.S.\nThe NBA Finals are tied at one game apiece, and if you\u2019re not already watching, you still have time to tune in. The Denver Nuggets are vying for their first title in franchise history. Hardly anybody expected their opponents, the No. 8 seed Miami Heat, to make it this far, but their star, Jimmy Butler, is one of the greatest competitors in all of basketball. He\u2019s going up against the mesmerizing Jamal Murray and the \ntwo-time MVP Nikola Joki\u0107\n, who, despite his 6-foot-11-inch stature, can dribble and pass like a guard.

I want to give a bit of context on this process , even if you both might be familiar with it, for clarity/visibility and to prepare you for the next step. \n\u00a0\nTypically, there\u2019s a deadline with RFPs for when questions are due to gain clarity on what we can provide for the scope and pricing in our proposal. MCF is a bit more flexible where we can meet with Susie Brown to ask questions directly before the RFP deadline (Friday, June 9\nth\n). I\u2019ve started putting some questions together listed below. Feel free to add to these questions based on a close read-through of the RFP. It\u2019s unlikely I\u2019ll be on the call so do what you can to find the answers to the questions below as well as any other questions you may have. \n\u00a0\nUltimately, what information can we get from Susie that will help us know which products to offer in a way that would provide the most value to MCF? And within a $15,000 budget!\n\u00a0\nQuestions:\n\u00a0\nThe RFP references the role development of the DEI Director and states that the role is currently open. We couldn\u2019t find a public job posting. Is the role listed on job sites now? Could we see the job description for the DEI Director role? Or how can we best learn about the objectives and goals for the DEI Director role?\nCould you further define the terms \u201cstaffing strategies\u201d and your needs for \u201cexperience analyzing and/or developing staffing models and strategies\u201d as listed under Qualifications and Services Requested?\nListed under the Background Information, it\u2019s stated that MCF\u2019s focus on DEI has included, \u201cexamining organizational culture by using the Transforming Organizational Culture Assessment; developing and offering to members the Transforming Philanthropy curriculum (adapted from the Transforming White Privilege curriculum)\u201d. How was that process of using the TOCA for the org and what were the outcomes?\n\u00a0\nRelevant article on MCF: \nhttps://www.lapiana.org/an-interview-with-camille-cyprian-director-of-program-strategy-and-dei-minnesota-council-on-foundations/\n\u00a0\nLet me know if this context is helpful or overkill! I\u2019ve also shared an article above that gives a bit of information on Camille Cyprian who was the DEI Director of MCF before 2019 \u2013 it might be helpful to know about this part in MCF\u2019s journey! \n\u00a0\nLet me know if you have any questions or feel free to add your questions from the RFP to this email (preferably before the call with Susie on Monday afternoon). \n\u00a0\nBest,\nHannah\n\u00a0\n------------------------------------------------------\nHannah Strack \u2013 she/her\nBusiness Development Associate \nEmail: \nh.strack@lcwmail.com\nPhone: +1 773-828-1202 [EST]\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\nwww\n\u00a0\n|\n\u00a0\nTwitter\n \n|\n\u00a0\nFacebook\n\u00a0\n|\n\u00a0\nLinkedIn\nTo inspire kindness, deepen\u00a0understanding, and foster equity in\u00a0the communities\u00a0where people live\u00a0and at the organizations where they\u00a0work.",

    "body": "Entertainment musts from Emma Sarappo \nSunday, June 4, 2023 \n \n \nKelli Mar\u00eda Korducki\n \nSenior editor\nGood morning, and welcome back to The Daily\u2019s Sunday culture edition, in which one \nAtlantic\n writer reveals what\u2019s keeping them entertained.\nToday\u2019s special guest is\n \nEmma Sarappo\n, an associate editor on \nThe Atlantic\n\u2019s Books team. Emma is also a frequent contributor to our Books Briefing newsletter, having recently written about \nbooks for a changing planet\n and making sense of the divide between \ntechnology and humanity\n. Right now Emma is looking forward to a once-in-a-lifetime cross-country concert trip, scratching her brain with the Two Dots smartphone puzzle game, and gearing up for the 60th-anniversary special of \nDoctor Who\n.\nFirst, here are three Sunday reads from \nThe Atlantic\n:\nThe \nSuccession\n plot point that explained the whole series\nFans\u2019 expectations of Taylor Swift are chafing against reality.\nThe blue-strawberry problem\nThe Culture Survey: Emma Sarappo\n \n\"['Doctor Who' is] still perfect sci-fi escapism,\" says the associate editor Emma Sarappo. Pictured: a still from the series. \n(Sophie Mutevelian / BBC)\n \nView in browser\nThe upcoming event I\u2019m most looking forward to: \nI\u2019m going to see Joni Mitchell, plus Brandi Carlile, play in Washington State next weekend. It\u2019s a bit of a wild trip\u2014I\u2019m heading all the way to the West Coast from Washington, D.C., and only staying for three days\u2014but my best friend and I figured this might be a once-in-our-lifetime opportunity, so we agreed we had to do it. \n[Related: \nThe unknowable Joni Mitchell\n \n(\nfrom 2017\n)\n]\nSomething delightful introduced to me by a kid in my life: \nLast year, my teenage cousin got me to watch \nHeartstopper\n,\n \nNetflix\u2019s adaptation of the webcomic and graphic-novel series by Alice Oseman, which is so delightful and fun. My cousin is Norwegian but apparently adores the books so much that she buys and reads them in English in order to get them sooner.\n [Related: \nHeartstopper\n and the era of feel-good, queer-teen romances\n]\nSomething I loved as a teenager and still love: \nSometimes I feel like I carry my teenage self around in my front pocket; her tastes are still so influential to me today. She loved \nDoctor Who\n, and she was right\u2014it\u2019s still perfect sci-fi escapism\u2014and \nwe \nare so excited for the forthcoming \nDoctor Who \nspecial\n that\u2019ll bring back the actors David Tennant and Catherine Tate, plus Yasmin Finney (whom I loved in \nHeartstopper\n)! Then we\u2019re due for a series with Ncuti Gatwa (whom I loved in \nSex Education\n). \n[Related: \nHow \nDoctor Who \nsurvived 50 years\n (\nfrom 2013)\n]\nThe last museum or gallery show that I loved: \nI was at the Philadelphia Museum of Art the other week and made a point of spending time in the room that holds Cy Twombly\u2019s \nFifty Days at Iliam\n, a series of 10 paintings that evoke the \nIliad \nand the Trojan War through gesture, color, and writing. They inspire really strong responses, because they\u2019re so large and so surprising\u2014at first glance, they appear scribbled or imprecise. If you stay long enough, you\u2019ll hear some gasps, or laughs. I loved that experience.\nA painting, sculpture, or other piece of visual art that I cherish: \nSo many, but one of the first that genuinely changed my life as a young adult is F\u00e9lix Gonz\u00e1lez-Torres\u2019s \n\u201cUntitled\u201d (Portrait of Ross in L.A.)\n, on view at the Art Institute of Chicago. I hear that teenagers are talking a lot about it on TikTok, which is sweet. When I was younger, we were all reblogging Gonz\u00e1lez-Torres\u2019s work \n\u201cUntitled\u201d (Perfect Lovers)\n on Tumblr.\nSomething I recently rewatched, reread, or otherwise revisited: \nI started listening to the Smiths again after their bassist, Andy Rourke, died last month. They\u2019re another formative teenage band for me\u2014two generations deep, because I got the CDs from my dad, who also found them formative in his youth. Today, lead singer \nMorrissey\u2019s racist rhetoric\n casts a pall over the band for me, but listening to the music, I understand entirely why I was so obsessed with it long before I\u2019d ever read anything about the band. Rourke was a huge part of that. \nThis video\n of the guitarist Johnny Marr inviting a kid onstage, basically daring him to play \u201cThis Charming Man,\u201d a crucial Rourke song\u2014and the kid suddenly, improbably, nailing the riff\u2014is one of my favorite things on the internet.\nA piece of journalism that recently changed my perspective on a topic: \nKatie Engelhart\u2019s \u201cThe Mother Who Changed: A Story of Dementia\u201d\n from \nThe New York Times Magazine\n last month. There are no easy answers here, so it didn\u2019t have me reverse any of my positions, but it opened my eyes to questions about autonomy and aging that I\u2019d never considered.\nA favorite story I\u2019ve read in \nThe Atlantic\n: \nPainful to pick just a few. \nPatricia Lockwood on \nTo the Lighthouse \nwas tailor-made for me.\n I just sent someone \nDara Mathis\u2019s story on the Black-liberation movement she grew up in.\n I read \nWilliam Langewiesche\u2019s story on Flight MH370\n exactly once and haven\u2019t stopped thinking about it, but I will never read it again (too frightening).\nMy favorite way of wasting time on my phone: \nTwo Dots.\n It frees me from the social web and scratches my brain perfectly.\nAn online creator that I\u2019m a fan of: \nMy TikTok is basically all cooking and jokes, which is ideal.

Her class had read this poem about some old statue, she said, and the abrupt turn at the end knocked them all out\u2014they laughed, and they made memes, because the suddenness of the speaker\u2019s realization felt so dramatic.

    "subject": "What people misunderstand about NIMBYs",
    "body": "Plus: Inside the meltdown at CNN \nFriday, June 2, 2023 \n \n \nKelli Mar\u00eda Korducki\n \nSenior editor\nHousing-policy experts largely agree that the solution to a housing-affordability crisis is to build more housing. Many residents support this notion in theory, until they\u2019re faced with the possibility of new housing developments in their own backyard\u2014in other words, NIMBYs. But \nAtlantic\n staff writer Jerusalem Demsas \nargues\n in a recent article that maybe these presumed villains of progress aren\u2019t the problem. Instead, they\u2019re a symptom of an approach to housing development that\u2019s doomed to fail.\nFirst, here are three new stories from \nThe Atlantic\n:\nInside the meltdown at CNN\nAmerica is headed toward collapse.\nWhy Putin\u2019s secret weapon failed\nLocal Control\n \n(Joe Raedle / Getty)\n \nView in browser\nKelli Mar\u00eda Korducki: \nYou\u2019ve written extensively about the national housing shortage and how it\u2019s making housing unaffordable for many people across the country. Why do new building projects often get held up or shut down, over and over again, by residents who say they want more affordable housing in their communities?\nJerusalem Demsas: \nPeople are very unhappy with the lack of housing affordability. They\u2019ll say in polls that they want there to be more types of housing available, that they want there to be more affordable types of housing available. They want their kids to be able to live near them. They want there to be senior housing. They want teachers to be able to afford to live in their communities; there\u2019s concern about police officers policing communities that they\u2019re not actually able to live in too. And yet, time and again, projects fail, because no individual development can check every single box for everyone.\nIn the story that I write, I\u2019m zeroing in on Denver and Colorado. But a lot of the point that I\u2019m trying to make is that you could replace those geographical names with basically anywhere and see the same story playing out. The promise of localism, of local control, is that you are responding to the particular needs and concerns of the people who live in that specific area. But if municipalities across the country keep reaching the same roadblocks\u2014which ultimately lead to anti-development, anti-growth outcomes\u2014is that actually a response to particular concerns? Or is that a structural problem?\nKelli: \nYou make a bold assertion in your article: \u201cSometimes NIMBYs have a point.\u201d What do you mean by that?\nJerusalem: \nA single development can\u2019t balance all of the concerns people have about housing. If the question is \u201cShould we allow this block to turn into duplexes?\u201d community members who support the idea of building more housing in general might respond, \u201cWhy here?\u201d And that response could be informed by reasonable concerns about housing that are broader than what that single development project entails. They may have concerns about gentrification, or about open space, or about the types of housing that are currently available.\nIf I\u2019m representing a city, and I\u2019m trying to convert one hotel into homeless housing, it\u2019s not going to respond to green-space concerns. It\u2019s not going to be able to speak to that, or to senior housing, or to teacher housing, or anything like that. Similarly, if you\u2019re trying to build a new condo development in an area where increasing numbers of rich young people are moving for jobs, that\u2019s not going to respond to the needs of people who have different kinds of concerns. And because no individual developments can check every single box, many projects end up falling through.\nKelli: \nSo what you\u2019re saying is that when hyperlocal political players are given too much power in these development plans, the bigger picture of a municipality or state\u2019s housing needs can get lost. And this can end up sabotaging progress in actually building the new housing that people want and need.\nJerusalem: \nExactly. We live in a pretty segregated society, both by class and by race, and on a variety of other different measures. When you restrict a development discussion to a very hyperlocal level, then you can\u2019t have necessary conversations to balance the wants of various interest groups. If you\u2019re dealing with a very rich, white area whose residents are wedded to their exclusionary zoning, they\u2019re always going to resist giving up their space for, for example, homeless housing. And even if these people want homeless housing to exist in general, they have no power to make that occur somewhere else. The only power they have is to exclude it from happening in their own place.\nWhen you expand the development process beyond a very hyperlocal level, then you can actually have broad conversations about what the state needs, and not just what this one locality says they want because they happen to live there right now.\nRelated:\nColorado\u2019s ingenious idea for solving the housing crisis\nHousing breaks people\u2019s brains.\nToday\u2019s News\nPresident Joe Biden is expected to \nsign\n the debt-ceiling bill before Monday and will deliver a rare Oval Office address on the topic this evening.\nAt least 50 people \nwere killed\n after trains collided in India\u2019s eastern state of Odisha.\nThe Department of Justice is \nending its investigation\n into classified documents at the home of former Vice President Mike Pence and has decided not to file charges.\nDispatches\nThe Books Briefing\n: \nThe author Annie Ernaux won the Nobel Prize last fall for her highly personal books, \nGal Beckerman writes\n.

Hundreds of AI executives, researchers, and other tech and business figures, including OpenAI CEO Sam Altman and Bill Gates, signed a one-sentence \nstatement\n written by the Center for AI Safety declaring that \u201cmitigating the risk of extinction from AI should be a global priority alongside other societal-scale risks such as pandemics and nuclear war.\u201d\nThose 22 words were released following a multi-week tour in which executives from \nOpenAI\n, \nMicrosoft\n, \nGoogle\n, and \nother tech companies\n called for limited regulation of AI. They spoke before Congress, in the European Union, and elsewhere about the need for industry and governments to collaborate to curb their product\u2019s harms\u2014even as their companies continue to invest billions in the technology.

    "body": "Hello Doug and Amelia, \n\u00a0\nGreat to meet you both this past Wednesday! As promised, please see attached for a brief project overview. We also discussed a bi-weekly meeting cadence from now until the in-person facilitation in September. I\u2019ve outlined the weeks these would fall in on slide three of the attached overview. Please let me know the best way to schedule these touchpoints\u2014happy to set up a recurring meeting or schedule a few at a time.\n\u00a0\nAs for the next steps,\n \n@amelia.azmi@richemont.com\n, could you send me the names of the 3-4 people you all would like to pilot this program? We\u2019d like to get them launched \nearly next week\n and give them an opportunity to take the assessment and meet with an IDI Qualified Admin about their results prior to launching everyone else.
