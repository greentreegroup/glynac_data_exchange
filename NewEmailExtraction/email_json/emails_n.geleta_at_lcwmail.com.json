    "subject": "Why live music costs so much",
    "body": "Plus: Our writers on the Supreme Court's affirmative-action decision \nThursday, June 29, 2023 \n \nThe Latest\nToday, the Supreme Court ruled that the race-conscious admissions programs as practiced at the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill and Harvard are unconstitutional, upending more than four decades of precedent on the use of race in college admissions.\nSpend time with our writers\u2019 analysis of the decision:\n\u201cRace neutral\u201d is the new \u201cseparate but equal,\u201d Uma Mazyck Jayakumar and Ibram X. Kendi argue.\nThe decision takes a tool meant to prevent discrimination against Black Americans and turns it on its head, Adam Harris explains.\nCurtailing affirmative action is a blow against a rising generation, Ronald Brownstein argues.\n \nLora Kelley\n \nAssociate editor\nThe price of attending blockbuster concerts is astronomical, but Americans are still buying tickets. Why, in our weird economic moment, is live music a priority?\nFirst, here are three more new stories from \nThe Atlantic\n:\nRussia has reached a dead end.\nThe end of optimism in China\n\u201cMy dad had dementia. He also had Facebook.\u201d\nFleeting and Scarce\n \nTaylor Swift performs at Ford Field on June 9 in Detroit. \n(Scott Legato / TAS23 / Getty Images for TAS Rights Management)\n \nView in browser\nFor the past few months, my Instagram feed has been peppered with posts of people going to see the Taylor Swift \nEras tour\n in various cities around the country. Friends and their friends, bedecked in cowboy boots, glitter, and beaded bracelets, are sharing giddy stories from stadium parking lots and nosebleed seats. I\u2019m happy for them\u2014it looks like fun!\u2014and, frankly, I\u2019m also wondering how they all scored tickets.\nTickets to the show were difficult to get on Ticketmaster, to put it mildly. So chaotic was the presale in November that Swift herself likened the process to \u201cbear attacks.\u201d It prompted a Senate Judiciary subcommittee to initiate a \nhearing\n on lack of competition in the concert-ticket industry. Resold tickets went for many hundreds, or even thousands, of dollars.\nI have become curious in recent months about why, in a period of high inflation and financial strain for many Americans, some people are so willing to shell out for concert tickets. It\u2019s not just Taylor\u2014\nBeyonc\u00e9\n and \nBruce Springsteen\n are also among the superstars who are selling out stadiums while \ncharging\n hundreds or thousands of dollars for passes to their blockbuster shows.\nThe obvious reason is that these artists are great, and many fans who can (\neven loosely\n) afford to see them want to. Unemployment is low, and some fans have discretionary income they are open to spending. People have deepened their relationship with musicians during the coronavirus pandemic, my colleague Spencer Kornhaber told me. He said that the huge appetite for concerts we are seeing now may be a \u201clagging indicator of that demand for experience.\u201d\nConcert tickets are not the stalwart inflation indicator that gas fluctuations or egg prices are, but how people approach them tells us a lot about the ways Americans are spending their money. Rapidly \nrising prices for services\n\u2014including items such as concert tickets\u2014are now responsible for a bigger portion of overall inflation than they have been in years past. As grocery inflation moderates and gas prices go down, the prices of services remain stubbornly high. (That \ncategory\n includes a range of nonphysical items that rely on labor, including hospital care and school tuition as well as event tickets.) Even as the Fed cranks up interest rates to try to curb consumer spending, these categories seem to be resistant. \u201cWe\u2019re not seeing that slowdown in [the cost of] services we expected,\u201d Jason Mercer, a live-entertainment analyst at Moody\u2019s Investors Service, told me. One possible reason that prices are high, he added, is that concert organizers and artists are \u201ctaking advantage\u201d of pent-up demand from consumers after years without live events.\nHow people are spending their money is a good indicator of how they are feeling. If someone is signing a long-term lease or buying a house, that suggests they feel optimistic about the future (at least optimistic enough that they are willing to enter a long-term financial engagement, which they expect they will have enough money to continue). But if someone is buying a concert ticket, that tells us more about how they are feeling right then, in that moment, as the \nNew York Times\n reporter Jeanna Smialek explained on a recent \nepisode\n of the \nTimes\n podcast \nThe Daily\n. Tickets are a onetime purchase\u2014though they can be a major one, and are becoming pricier.\nThe average resale price for concert tickets went from $116 over a three-month period in mid-2019 to $240 over the same period this year, according to data SeatGeek shared with me. And the inflation rate for \u201clive performing admission events\u201d is currently 2.6 percent higher than overall inflation in the U.S., \nReuters\n reported. (In a paper on \u201crockonomics,\u201d Princeton \nresearchers\n found that from the late 1980s through early 2000s, concert-ticket prices outpaced inflation.)\nA number of factors are causing ticket prices to spike. Even before the pandemic, the costs of running a large show\u2014factoring in artists, vendors, venues, promoters, and others\u2014were high. Now \nnew variables\n,\n such as supply-chain disruptions\n and \nCOVID-related delay\ns, have made it even pricier. Mercer, the Moody\u2019s analyst, told me that artists, who help set the initial price for concert tickets, may also be influenced by seeing others raise prices: \u201cIt's almost as though one artist sets a new bar and then the next artist can take it from there.\u201d\nMany people are also blaming Ticketmaster, whose parent company, Live Nation, controls a significant share of the live-music-ticketing market, for exorbitant prices and fees. In January, the Senate Judiciary Committee \nheld a hearing\n about the effects of the company\u2019s dominance. (The musician Clyde Lawrence began his testimony, \u201cGood morning, senators, and thank you for inviting us today to the most unique gig we\u2019ve had in years.\u201d) Some artists have tried to resist Ticketmaster. Robert Smith of The Cure successfully pressured the company to refund some fees this spring, and Maggie Rogers announced that she would sell some tickets for her Summer of \u201923 Tour in person. (Asked for comment about ticket prices and their fee calculation, Ticketmaster passed along links to \nblog\n \nposts\n and other publicly available information. Their testimony in the January Senate hearing can be read \nhere\n.)\nAlthough major concerts are now massively expensive, \nsmaller artists\n are finding touring so unsustainable that they are canceling their shows. That the economics of live music are not panning out for them suggests something surprising: Live music \u201cmight be undervalued, really,\u201d Spencer told me.\nConcerts are not the main driver of inflation, of course, but economists are still paying attention to the events\u2019 impact on the wider economy. As I wrote in this \nnewsletter\n a couple of weeks ago, economists in Sweden worried that Beyonc\u00e9\u2019s Renaissance \ntour\n had led to a surge in local prices. Last week, the chief economist of UBS Global Wealth Management published a \nnote\n titled \u201cA Beyonc\u00e9 Price Bounce?\u201d exploring whether her tour had led to a similar phenomenon in the United Kingdom. \u201cFor UK inflation, the pressures may persist,\u201d he concluded.\nIn this odd economic moment, many people are finding that concerts and other experiences are how they want to spend their money. Seeing Taylor sing for more than three hours, or reaching transcendence in Beyonc\u00e9\u2019s mosh pit, may just be worth it to some. \u201cHaving one special night with one particular, highly coveted artist in one space\u2014you can never have it again,\u201d Spencer told me. \u201cLive music is one of the most fleeting and scarce commodities that you can imagine.\u201d\nRelated:\nHow Taylor Swift broke Ticketmaster\nWhy it matters who caused inflation\nToday\u2019s News\nViolent protests over the \nfatal police shooting\n of a 17-year-old in France continued for a second night. Almost 200 people were arrested yesterday evening.\nThe U.S. economy \ngrew 2 percent\n in the first quarter of the year, which was higher than previous estimates.\n\u201cPresumed human remains\u201d \nwere recovered\n from the wreckage of the Titan submersible.\nEvening Read\n \n(Bill Ingalls / NASA / Getty)\n \nScientists Found Ripples in Space and Time.

    "body": "Plus: Stop firing your friends. \nWednesday, June 28, 2023 \n \n \nElaine Godfrey\n \nStaff writer\nThe Supreme Court released a somewhat surprising\u2014and pretty important\u2014decision yesterday. Should it change the way we think about the Court? Before we get into it, here are three new stories from \nThe Atlantic\n:\n \nThe comic strip that explains the evolution of American parenting\nThe new Republican litmus test is very dangerous.\nStop firing your friends.\nConservative, Not MAGA\n \n(Mandel Ngan / AFP via Getty)\n \nView in browser\nIt\u2019s good to be back at The Daily! I spent a lot of time last year writing \nabout\n \ncandidates\n trafficking in election denial. Looming above all of my coverage was a case at the Supreme Court that would determine the future of election law and, by extension, American democracy. That case, \nMoore v. Harper\n, was decided yesterday. I talked with my colleague Russell Berman, a staff writer on our Politics team, about what the decision means, and whether it shifts the dominant narrative about the Roberts Court.\nElaine Godfrey: \nRussell! I\u2019m so glad we get to talk about this. Yesterday was a big SCOTUS day. In a 6\u20133 vote, the Court rejected the independent state legislature theory in a case called \nMoore v. Harper\n. What is that theory\u2014and why were people so anxious about it?\nRussell Berman:\n The theory basically interprets the Constitution as giving near-total authority over elections to state legislatures, over and above state courts, election administrators, secretaries of state, and even governors. What this means in practice is that because Republicans have overwhelming majorities in many of the closest presidential swing states, including Wisconsin, Georgia, and North Carolina, the adoption of this theory by the Supreme Court would have allowed GOP lawmakers in those states to overrule or simply ignore election decisions they didn\u2019t agree with.\nDemocrats believed that Republicans would then have used that power to overturn close elections in 2024, just like former President Donald Trump tried to get his allies to do in 2020.\nElaine: \nThanks to Trump, there were all kinds of Republicans denying the outcome of the 2020 election, as well as sowing doubt ahead of the midterms. A lot of those candidates lost in the midterms, though, including \nKari Lake in Arizona\n. Is this SCOTUS decision the final coda on the election-denial fight? Are we finally done with that stuff now?\nRussell: \nNot so fast, Elaine. As Rick Hasen points out at \nSlate\n, the Supreme Court\u2019s decision doesn\u2019t totally quash the opportunity for election-related shenanigans in the courts. Although the Court declined to give state legislatures unfettered power over elections, it simultaneously warned state courts that \nfederal\n courts\u2014including the Supreme Court\u2014could still overrule them on cases involving federal elections. That\u2019s what happened in \nBush v. Gore\n, when a conservative majority on the Supreme Court essentially decided the 2000 election in favor of George W. Bush. And let\u2019s say that in 2024, the Democratic-controlled state supreme court in Pennsylvania issues a ruling on a big election case in favor of Joe Biden. The Court\u2019s decision today served as a reminder that its members could still have the final say.\nElaine: \nTwo Trump-appointed justices, Brett Kavanaugh and Amy Coney Barrett, joined three liberal justices in the majority decision in this case. That felt surprising to me. Was it to you?\nRussell: \nNot entirely. Although both Kavanaugh and Barrett joined the majority overruling \nRoe v. Wade\n in the \nDobbs\n abortion decision last year, they have not always joined what is now the Court\u2019s far-right wing in election cases: Justices Samuel Alito, Clarence Thomas, and Neil Gorsuch, who all dissented from yesterday\u2019s decision. Kavanaugh voted with the majority earlier this month \nin upholding a key part of the Voting Rights Act\n, while Barrett joined the dissent.\nElaine: \nSo what does this mean for our understanding of the Court at this moment? Is it more liberal-leaning than \nDobbs\n might have suggested?\nRussell: \nIt\u2019s a stretch to call it more liberal. But these decisions suggest that there is a limit to the Court\u2019s rightward shift of the past several years. Chief Justice Roberts in particular continues to resist efforts to upend decades of judicial precedent, and he has had some success in persuading newer justices like Kavanaugh and Barrett to join him. If anything, the Court\u2019s decisions over the past few years suggest it\u2019s conservative but not MAGA. Its ruling in \nDobbs\n was a victory for conservatives, but Trump\u2019s own commitment to the anti-abortion cause \nhas wavered\n. And in addition to this state-legislature ruling, the Court ruled against Trump several times toward the end of his presidency\u2014and, of course, rejected him in his Hail Mary bid to overturn his defeat in 2020.\nElaine: \nSo you\u2019re saying that Democrats shouldn\u2019t start buying \nthose celebrity prayer candles\n with Roberts\u2019s face on them?\nRussell: \nOnly if they also start buying candles with Mitch McConnell\u2019s face on them. Roberts is playing a role similar to the one McConnell has played in the Senate over the past few years. Roberts either wrote or joined several opinions that have been devastating to liberal causes. He\u2019s helped to eviscerate Section 4 of the Voting Rights Act, dramatically expand the scope of the Second Amendment, and limit Congress\u2019s ability to enact campaign-finance regulations. But he\u2019s obviously attuned to public attitudes toward the Court and to that end has tried, with limited success, to restrain the most aggressive impulses of his more ideological colleagues.\nElaine: \nThere are a few other really important cases coming down the pike, including one about college affirmative-action programs and another related to President Joe Biden canceling student debt. If there\u2019s a limit to the Court\u2019s rightward shift, does that tell us anything about how these cases will go? Should progressives plan to be happy?\nRussell:\n Probably not. If the pattern of recent years holds, the relief that progressives are experiencing following their victories in this case and in the voting-rights decision will give way to more anger and disappointment when the Court releases its final opinions of the term. Most legal observers expect the Court to deal a fatal blow to affirmative action after a series of decisions that limited its use in college admissions. And they also believe the Court will rule against President Joe Biden\u2019s effort to unilaterally forgive up to $20,000 in student debt for millions of borrowers.\nRelated:\nThe Roberts Court draws a line.\nThe Court eviscerates the independent state legislature theory.\nToday\u2019s News\nWildfire smoke from Canada has blanketed large portions of the United States, leading more than a dozen states to \nissue air-quality alerts\n.\nFormer President Trump \ncountersued E.

Together, the news stories formed a classic example of the macroeconomic principle of too much, too little, too late.\nIn rapid response to the Netflix needling came word that the couple was working on a possible prequel to \nGreat Expectations\n, centered on the life of a young \nMiss Havisham\n.

    "body": "Plus: The tape of Trump discussing classified documents \nTuesday, June 27, 2023 \n \n \nLora Kelley\n \nAssociate editor\nLast week, Elon Musk and Mark Zuckerberg announced their plans to duke it out in a cage fight. But this potential feud is less important than what it tells us about how Musk is influencing the rules of engagement in Silicon Valley.\nFirst, here are four new stories from \nThe Atlantic\n:\nThe tape of Trump discussing classified documents\nAmerica\u2019s most popular drug has a puzzling side effect. We finally know why.\nGoodbye, Ozempic.\nThe Roberts Court draws a line.\nA Race to the Bottom\n \n(Chesnot / Getty)\n \nView in browser\nSomething strange is happening on Mark Zuckerberg\u2019s Instagram.\nFor years, he posted periodic, classic dad-and-CEO fare: anniversary shots with his wife. Photos of his kids and dog being cute. Meta product announcements.\nIn recent months, though, Zuckerberg has been posting more about fighting. Not the kind that involves firing back at critics on behalf of his oft-embattled social-media empire, but actual mixed-martial-arts training. Earlier this month, he posted a video of himself tussling with a jiujitsu champion. On Memorial Day, he posted himself in a camouflage flak vest, flushed after an intense \narmy workout\n. And last week, Zuckerberg and Elon Musk said they were going to have \na cage fight\n. The men apparently have \nongoing \npersonal tensions, and Meta is working on building a \nTwitter competitor\n. But \nannouncing\n in public their intent to fight takes things to another level.\nIf you rolled your eyes at the cage-fight news: fair enough. The idea of two middle-aged executives, each facing an onslaught of business and public-image problems, literally duking it out is a bit on the nose. But the fight itself\u2014and whether or not it happens\u2014is less important than what it tells us about how Musk is reshaping Silicon Valley. Musk is mainstreaming new standards of behavior, and some of his peers are joining him in misguided acts of masculine aggression and populist appeals.\nLeaders such as Musk and Zuckerberg (and, to some extent, even their less-bombastic but quite buff peer Jeff Bezos) have lately been striving to embody and project a specific flavor of masculine\u2014and political\u2014strength. As my colleague Ian Bogost \nwrote\n last week, \u201cthe nerd-CEO\u2019s mighty body has become an apparatus for securing and extending his power.\u201d\nThe two executives\u2019 cage-fight announcement is \u201ca reflection of a really tight monoculture of Silicon Valley\u2019s most powerful people, most of whom are men,\u201d Margaret O\u2019Mara, a historian at the University of Washington who researches the tech industry, told me. In other words, the would-be participants embody the industry\u2019s bro culture.\nZuckerberg\u2019s recent interest in waging physical battles marks a departure for the CEO, who a few years ago seemed more interested in emulating someone like Bill Gates, an executive who parlayed his entrepreneurial success into philanthropy, O\u2019Mara added. Zuckerberg has been very famous since he was quite young. His early years at the helm of his social-media empire\u2014\u201cI\u2019m CEO, Bitch\u201d \nbusiness cards\n and all\u2014were lightly, and sometimes ungenerously, fictionalized in \nThe Social Network\n by the time he was in his mid-20s. He has consciously curated \nhis image\n in the years since.\nFor a long time, Zuckerberg led Facebook as a \u201cproduct guy,\u201d focusing on the tech while letting Sheryl Sandberg lead the ads business and communications. But overlapping crises\u2014disinformation, Cambridge Analytica, antitrust\u2014after the 2016 election seemingly changed his approach: First, he struck a contrite tone and embarked on a \nlistening tour in 2017\n.The response was not resoundingly positive. By the following summer, he had hardened his image at the company, announcing that he was gearing up to be a \u201c\nwartime\u201d leader\n. He has struck various stances in public over the years, but coming to blows with business rivals has not been among them\u2014yet.\nMusk, meanwhile, has a history of such stunts. At the onset of the war in Ukraine, he \ntweeted\n that he would like to battle Vladimir Putin in single combat, and he apparently has ongoing back pain linked to a past \nfight with a sumo wrestler\n. That Zuckerberg is playing along shows that the rules of engagement have changed.\nMusk has incited a race to the bottom for Silicon Valley leaders. As he becomes more powerful, some\u00a0 \nother executives\n are quietly\u2014and not so quietly\u2014following his lead, cracking down on dissent, slashing jobs, and attempting to wrestle back power from employees. Even as Musk has destabilized Twitter and sparked near-constant controversy in his leadership of the platform, some peers have applauded him. He widened the scope of what CEOs could do, giving observers tacit permission to push boundaries. \u201cHe\u2019s someone who\u2019s willing to do things in public that are transgressing the rules of the game,\u201d O\u2019Mara said.\nDuring the first few months of Musk\u2019s Twitter reign, few executives were willing to praise him on the record\u2014though Reed Hastings, then a co-CEO of Netflix, did \ncall\n Musk \u201cthe bravest, most creative person on the planet\u201d in November. A few months later, Marc Benioff, the CEO of Salesforce, \ntold \nInsider\n that executives around Silicon Valley have been asking, \u201cDo they need to unleash their own Elon within them?\u201d \nThe Washington Post\n reported this past Saturday that Zuckerberg was undergoing an \u201c\nElonization\n\u201d as he attempts to appeal to Musk\u2019s base, the proposed cage fight being the latest event in his rebrand. (Facebook declined to comment. A request for comment to Twitter\u2019s press email was returned with a poop emoji auto-responder.)\nWhether or when the cage match will actually happen is unclear. Musk\u2019s mother, for her part, has \nlobbied against it\n.

    "subject": "Putin is caught in his own trap",
    "body": "Plus: The first MAGA Democrat \nMonday, June 26, 2023 \n \n \nIsabel Fattal\n \nSenior editor\n\u201cA short recap of the past 24 hours in Russia reads like the backstory for a fanciful episode of \nMadam Secretary \nor \nThe West Wing\n,\u201d my colleague Tom Nichols wrote yesterday.\n \nToday\u2019s newsletter will walk you through our writers\u2019 most urgent and clarifying analysis on the whirlwind events of the past weekend.\nFirst, here are three new stories from \nThe Atlantic\n:\nThe first MAGA Democrat\nDear Therapist: I\u2019ve been dumped by my friends.\nThe battle for I-95\nA Permanent Scar\n \n(Getty)\n \nView in browser\nThis past Saturday morning, Yevgeny Prigozhin, a convicted criminal who leads the Wagner mercenary group, declared war on the Russian Ministry of Defense. After advancing hundreds of miles toward the capital, Prigozhin announced that a deal had been struck and that his forces were turning back around.\nAs \nAtlantic\n writers reminded us throughout the weekend, Prigozhin\u2019s brief coup was and remains a fast-moving story, and following it requires disentangling complex webs of disinformation. Below is some of our writers\u2019 most useful analysis to help you put Russia\u2019s crisis in context.\nThe coup is over, but Putin is in trouble.\n\u201cWe can at this point only speculate about why Prigozhin undertook this putsch, and why it all failed so quickly,\u201d Tom \nwrote\n on Saturday, but \u201cthis bizarre episode is not a win for Putin.\u201d Tom explains:\nThe Russian dictator has been visibly wounded, and he will now bear the permanent scar of political vulnerability. Instead of looking like a decisive autocrat (or even just a mob boss in command of his crew), Putin left Moscow after issuing a short video in which he was visibly angry and off his usual self-assured game.\nAs for Prigozhin, the Wagner Group leader \u201cdrew blood and then walked away from a man who never, ever lets such a personal offense go unavenged. But Putin may have had no choice, which is yet another sign of his precarious situation,\u201d Tom writes.\nThe Russian president is caught in his own trap.\nOur staff writer Anne Applebaum \nsuggests\n paying attention to the reactions of the Russian people. When the Wagner Group mercenaries arrived in the city of Rostov-on-Don on Saturday morning and declared themselves the new rulers, \u201cthey met no resistance,\u201d Anne reported. \u201cOne \nphotograph\n, published by \nThe New York Times\n, shows them walking at a leisurely pace across a street, one of their tanks in the background, holding yellow coffee cups.\u201d She goes on:\nThis was the most remarkable aspect of the whole day: Nobody seemed to mind, particularly, that a brutal new warlord had arrived to replace the existing regime\u2014not the security services, not the army, and not the general public. On the contrary, many seemed sorry to see him go.\nTo understand this response, Anne explains, observers must reckon with the power of apathy. \u201cA certain kind of autocrat, of whom Putin is the outstanding example, seeks to convince people of the opposite: not to participate, not to care, and not to follow politics at all.\u201d Through a constant barrage of propaganda, Putin convinces Russian citizens that there is no truth to be found. And if nothing is true, then why protest or engage in politics?\nBut apathy works both ways: \u201cIf no one cares about anything, that means they don\u2019t care about their supreme leader, his ideology, or his war,\u201d Anne explains. \u201cRussians haven\u2019t flocked to sign up to fight in Ukraine. They haven\u2019t rallied around the troops in Ukraine or held emotive ceremonies marking either their successes or their deaths. Of course they haven\u2019t organized to oppose the war, but they haven\u2019t organized to support it either.\u201d\nWhy did Prigozhin\u2019s coup fail?\nBrian Klaas, who has studied coups around the world, \noffered\n some lessons from the history of such uprisings. The most successful coups are those run by a unified military, Klaas writes. \u201cIn Thailand, for example, coups are usually executed by the military brass, who announce that they are toppling civilian politicians. With nobody with guns to oppose them, Thai coups almost always succeed \u2026 After all, what\u2019s the president or prime minister going to do\u2014shoot back at the army?\u201d\nIn Russia, however, the coup was carried out by a faction connected to the country\u2019s military sector. In those cases, \u201cthe plot will likely succeed less on strength than on perception.

    "body": "Entertainment musts from Franklin Foer \nSunday, June 25, 2023 \n \nGood morning. Before we turn to the Sunday culture edition of this newsletter, here are some of our writers\u2019 most recent stories to help you make sense of the situation in Russia.\nWhy didn\u2019t the Wagner coup succeed?\nPrigozhin planned this.\nThe coup is over, but Putin is in trouble.\n \nIsabel Fattal\n \nSenior editor\nWelcome back to The Daily\u2019s Sunday culture edition, in which one \nAtlantic\n writer reveals what\u2019s keeping them entertained.\nToday\u2019s special guest is \nAtlantic\n staff writer Franklin Foer. Frank is currently at work on a \nbook\n about the first two years of the Biden presidency; he has recently written for \nThe Atlantic \nabout \ncontroversies in the book world\n and \nthe act of psychoanalyzing American presidents\n. He\u2019s currently reliving a transcendent music experience he shared with his daughter, wishing he could find a TV show as good as \nSuccession\n\u2014especially in the art of \u201csibling razzing\u201d\u2014and watching Bill Nighy any time he graces the screen.\nFirst, here are three Sunday reads from \nThe Atlantic\n:\nGo ahead, try to explain milk.\nThe ghost of a once era-defining show\nHow the vape shops won\nThe Culture Survey: Frank Foer\n \nView in browser\nSomething delightful introduced to me by a kid in my life:\n When my oldest daughter was 3, I made a determined effort to teach her how to eat with a fork and knife, culturally speaking. I bought used VHS copies of one of the most improbable shows in the history of network television, \nYoung Person\u2019s Guide to the Orchestra\n, in which a dashing Leonard Bernstein sweeps the hair from his face as he attempts to explain classical music to a CBS audience in the 1960s. For nearly two whole minutes, I managed to coerce her to sit on the couch with me in front of the black-and-white broadcast. Then she broke free and changed the channel to \nThe\n \nBackyardigans\n.\nI thought about this doomed experiment in parental pedantry recently because my daughter is now 18. A few weeks back, she graduated from high school, and she\u2019s off to college in the fall. Just before the beginning of her second semester of senior year, we vowed (or was I coercing her again?) to watch every movie on the newly released \nSight and Sound\n \nlist\n of all-time greatest films. We were going to start with Chantal Akerman\u2019s \nJeanne Dielman\n, the surprise at the top of the rankings. A family member dismissed the project as hopelessly pretentious, and sure enough, this plan didn\u2019t fare any better with my daughter than my attempt to foist Bernstein on her.\nBut one of the joys of her teenage years has been our cultural convergence. Because she\u2019s an enthusiast for gardening, a couple of months back, we jointly curated a Spotify playlist of songs about plants, which happens to be a ubiquitous musical metaphor.\nDuring her senior year, we started going to concerts together for acts we both liked\u2014to Big Thief and Phoebe Bridgers, to see a group from New Zealand called The Beths. (\nExpert in a Dying Field\n is the impeccable title of The Beths\u2019 most recent album.) For Chanukah, she bought us tickets for a brassy Brooklyn group called Rubblebucket. I had barely heard of it. But attending the concert was one of the great musical experiences of my life. The band was exuberant\u2014horns blaring, lead singer pushing her anaerobic capacity with manic dancing\u2014and so were we.\nIn their book, \nAll Things Shining\n, the philosophers Hubert Dreyfus and Sean Dorrance Kelly argue that the transformative reading of Western classics\u2014and moments of passionate engagement with culture\u2014can help us rediscover purpose in a secular society, because it can supply a similar sensation of transcendence. (It\u2019s a lovely short read.) They would call the experience of culturally induced sublimation \u201cwhooshing up.\u201d At the 9:30 Club, with a band I barely knew, my daughter and I were, in fact, whooshing up. Because I knew that moment of fatherhood was so fleeting, it felt genuinely ecstatic.\nThe culture or entertainment product my friends are talking about most right now:\n I find it annoying how many conversations return to the inadequacy of television after \nSuccession\n. They are annoying because they are true. Every suggestion for a replacement is impoverished by comparison.\nLike many couples, my wife and I will frequently watch shows on our devices at our own pace. (Yes, it\u2019s a mark of my selfishness\u2014and my inability to pass the marshmallow test\u2014that I annoyingly race ahead.) She\u2019s still making her way through Season 4. I\u2019m rewatching episodes with her just so I can study the poetry of familial teasing. It takes characters uninhibited by superegos and morality to realize the literary heights of the sibling-razzing genre.\n [\nRelated: The \nSuccession\n plot point that explained the whole series\n]\nAn actor I would watch in anything:\n Bill Nighy. I would even watch him as a catatonic English civil servant confronting his own mortality. That\u2019s the conceit of \nLiving\n, which just began streaming on Netflix. Kazuo Ishiguro wrote the screenplay, which is an adaptation of a Kurosawa film, which is an adaptation of a Tolstoy novella. The movie is borderline sappy but saved by its Englishness. In moments of catharsis, it pulls back just enough to stay classy, unable to fully express its emotions.\nIt\u2019s disturbing to see Nighy play a character so old and inhibited, because he\u2019s a balletic actor, usually bursting with charm. I love to watch him walk across the screen. He packs a Russian novel\u2019s worth of character into his gait.\nI\u2019m an evangelist for his turn in the \nWorricker Trilogy\n, a series of BBC thrillers written by David Hare. The series is about the War on Terror. Nighy is a rogue MI5 agent who seeks to undermine the power-mad Tony Blair\u2013like prime minister, played by Ralph Fiennes. For whatever reason, nobody seems to have ever heard about this miniseries, but it\u2019s sitting there on Apple TV.\n [\nRelated: The movie that helped Kazuo Ishiguro make sense of the world\n]\nSomething I recently rewatched, reread, or otherwise revisited:\n After Martin Amis\u2019s death, I picked up a copy of his \u201c\nnovelized autobiography\n,\u201d \nInside Story\n, that was lying in the middle of a pile in the bedroom. It\u2019s a book very much about mortality\u2014that of his friends (Christopher Hitchens and Saul Bellow) and his own. Reviewing the book in \nThe Atlantic\n, my colleague \nJames Parker wrote\n, \u201cHe wants to lance the moment with language, and he wants his language to live forever.\u201d Reading Amis\u2019s own farewell, at the book\u2019s end, it\u2019s impossible to believe that it won\u2019t. \n[\nRelated: Jennifer Egan: I learned how to be funny from Martin Amis.\n]\nMy favorite way of wasting time on my phone:\n Searching for rumors about which players Arsenal Football Club might buy this summer.\nThe arts/culture/entertainment event I\u2019m most looking forward to:\n I can\u2019t wait to see the postponed Philip Guston exhibit at the National Gallery.

    "body": "Plus: The nerds are bullies now. \nFriday, June 23, 2023 \n \n \nIsabel Fattal\n \nSenior Editor\nToday, the hosts of our podcast \nHow to Talk to People\n offer advice on making small talk, finding connection, and prioritizing friendships in a world that doesn\u2019t always put non-romantic relationships first.\nFirst, here are four new stories from \nThe Atlantic\n:\nHas COVID\u2019s patient zero finally been named?\nThe elegant, utterly original comedy of Alex Edelman\nThe nerds are bullies now.\nIndia is not Modi, we once said. I wish I still believed it.\nAdvice, Not Homework\n \n(The Atlantic)\n \nView in browser\nThe title of the most recent season of\n The Atlantic\n\u2019s \nHow To\n podcast, \nHow to Talk to People\n,\n \nwas sort of a joke\u2014but not entirely, the podcast\u2019s host, Julie Beck, and its producer, Rebecca Rashid, told me recently. Talking to people is not as easy as it might sound. For instance: How does a person make small talk without fainting from awkwardness? And how can we expand our social connections in a society that\u2019s not exactly built for meeting new people? I chatted with Julie and Becca about this season of the podcast, which wraps up next week, and about the value of focusing on the human relationships that tend to get ignored.\nIsabel Fattal: \nHave either of you taken any advice from the podcast back to your own life? Have you met an acquaintance on a train and said, \n\u201cIt\u2019s been so great talking to you. I\u2019m going to go read my book now\u201d\n?\nJulie Beck:\n \nI have not been brave enough to use that line yet, but I also don\u2019t know if the situation has arisen. I definitely feel out of my body when I\u2019m doing small talk sometimes now. I have the meta commentary of, \nAm I doing a good job?\nBecca Rashid:\n I\u2019ve learned from the show more about boundaries for people who \ndon\u2019t\n always want to be spoken to. I\u2019m the person striking up a conversation with everyone\u2014at caf\u00e9s I work at, the bus driver, anyone I see consistently enough.\nJulie:\n You took us to your favorite boba shop, and as we walked in, they were like, \u201cBecca!\u201d\nWhen I think about what I\u2019ve learned, it\u2019s less about me changing my habits than just thinking about community a little bit differently. I'm always beating myself up for not reaching out enough or not doing X, Y, or Z. I tend to think, \nIf I was just more diligent and better and did all of these things, then we would have a beautiful, interconnected, happy community utopia\n. I\u2019ve learned about balancing the reality of life and people\u2019s different needs and competing priorities. Not everyone is going to have the same priorities as you, and that\u2019s fine. I\u2019ve learned to notice what you have and be grateful for that, and not always try to optimize every facet of how you approach your relationships.\nIsabel:\n I love that, because I think, in our self-help-focused era, you can listen to a podcast like this and think, \nOh, this podcast is going to help me optimize every moment of my life\n. It\u2019s good to remind ourselves that\u2019s not the point.\nJulie:\n Right. We want to give you advice, but we don\u2019t want to give you homework.\nIsabel:\n Julie, after conducting 100 interviews with groups of friends for your \u201c\nFriendship Files\n\u201d series, you landed on \nthe six forces that fuel friendship\n. Has this podcast changed your view of those six forces at all?\nJulie:\n \nI do think all six forces came across in a lot of these conversations\u2014particularly \nintention\n, being deliberate and putting effort in, and also \ngrace\n, which I think is what we were just talking about in terms of \u201c\ns\ntop optimizing.\u201d One question I had for myself is whether \nobligation\n should be added. I think that word has a really negative connotation: It\u2019s something that you don\u2019t \nwant\n to do, something you are burdened by. But that was a big thread of conversation throughout this podcast, about how so much of friendship culture in America is designed around \nnot\n putting obligations on one another.\nI don\u2019t think we ever used this, because I felt\u2014and continue to feel, even in this moment\u2014like a cheeseball, pretentious person.\n \nBut there is a C. S. Lewis quote I really love\u2014he wrote a letter to his friend after his wife died, and reflected on having a lot of free time he wished he didn\u2019t have. He wrote, \u201cOne doesn\u2019t realise in early life that the price of freedom is loneliness. To be happy one must be tied.\u201d\nI don\u2019t actually think of all obligations as a bad thing. In some ways, the commitments that we make to our friends and our neighbors fuel our happiness.\nIsabel:\n Is there anything else you were hoping to discuss that we didn\u2019t get to?\nJulie:\n Just that Becca and I really became friends while we made the podcast.\nBecca: \nI\u2019m a big \u201cfood is my love language\u201d person. Julie has brought me food at work, but she\u2019s also brought food to my house. I think that was the moment I realized we were true friends, Julie. For me, it was the reception of the food.\nRelated:\nHow to make small talk \nThe six forces that fuel friendship\nListen to the full \nHow to Talk to People\n series here.\nToday\u2019s News\nThe Supreme Court \nruled in favor\n of the Biden administration\u2019s immigration-enforcement guidelines, which prioritize the arrest of undocumented people who have serious criminal records, are deemed threats to national security, or recently crossed the border.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\nStarbucks workers in Seattle \nlaunched a strike\n, alleging that Pride-month decorations are being banned in some stores, which Starbucks has denied.

    "body": "Plus: How the vape shops won \nThursday, June 22, 2023 \n \n \nLora Kelley\n \nAssociate editor\nAn expedition to see the remains of the Titanic turned into a tragedy. How did it go so wrong?\nFirst, here are four new stories from \nThe Atlantic\n:\nWhy not Whitmer?\nThe ghost of a once era-defining show\nHow the vape shops won\nGo ahead, try to explain milk.\nLost Contact\n \nRescue teams on a search for the tourist submersible with five people on board, in Boston, Massachusetts, on June 21 \n(Fatih Aktas / Anadolu Agency via Getty)\n \nView in browser\nThe Titan, a submersible vessel carrying passengers to see the ruins of the Titanic, lost contact with its support ship during a dive on Sunday. The ensuing search-and-rescue mission in the Atlantic Ocean covered some 10,000 square miles. This afternoon, OceanGate Expeditions, the tourism and research company running the voyage, \nannounced\n that it believed that all of the passengers \u201chave sadly been lost.\u201d The U.S. Coast Guard said soon after that debris from the vessel had been found on the ocean floor, about \n1,600 feet\n from the bow of the Titanic.\nThe search-and-rescue effort had become a race against the clock, as the vessel \nwas believed to have\n had about four days\u2019 worth of oxygen on board. Five people were on the expedition: Stockton Rush, OceanGate\u2019s chief executive; Hamish Harding, a British businessman and explorer; Paul-Henri Nargeolet, who had traveled to the Titanic site more than 35 times; Shahzada Dawood, a British-Pakistani businessman; and Suleman Dawood, Shahzada\u2019s 19-year-old son. Suleman was a business student in Glasgow.\nOver the past week, alarming reports about the vessel have emerged. As my colleague Marina Koren wrote in a story today about the tragic ending to Sunday\u2019s expedition:\nMost concerning of all, it is not clear whether the Titan was inspected for safety by outside experts. In 2018, dozens of industry experts \nwarned\n OceanGate that if the company didn\u2019t put the Titan through an independent safety assessment, its Titanic expeditions could face potentially \u201ccatastrophic\u201d problems. Even OceanGate\u2019s own director of marine operations was at the time worried about \u201cthe potential dangers to passengers of the Titan as the submersible reached extreme depths,\u201d \nThe New York Times\n \nreported\n this week. At least one previous dive had problems too: According to \nPogue\n, a Titan expedition last year got lost on the seafloor for about five hours.\nAlthough officials don\u2019t know what caused the disaster or what regulations might have prevented it, OceanGate\u2019s \nleaders\n have argued in the past that innovation can be at odds with safety regulations. In a 2019 blog post, the company wrote, \u201cBringing an outside entity up to speed on every innovation before it is put into real-world testing is anathema to rapid innovation.\u201d (OceanGate did not respond to a request for comment about safety concerns regarding the Titan.)\nAs Marina noted today, the space-tourism industry often draws attention to the safety measures of its craft\u2014at least in public. (What the companies do in private is another story, she reminds us.) But by comparison, \u201cOceanGate\u2019s public approach to safety seems almost cavalier, less like modern-day space tourism and more reminiscent of the rushed and occasionally ramshackle efforts of the space race,\u201d she writes. In the 2018 open letter from industry experts, more than three dozen people, including oceanographers and industry experts, warned that the company\u2019s \u201cexperimental\u201d approach \u201cwould have serious consequences for everyone in the industry.\u201d\nWhat those consequences might be remains to be seen. At the news conference earlier today, John Mauger, a rear admiral of the U.S. Coast Guard, acknowledged that many questions linger about how, when, and why this happened. \u201cThat\u2019s going to be, I\u2019m sure, the focus of future review,\u201d he said. \u201cRight now, we\u2019re focused on documenting the scene.\u201d\nRelated\n:\nThe Titanic sub and the draw of extreme tourism\nHow could this have happened?\nToday\u2019s News\nIndian Prime Minister Narendra Modi is meeting with President Joe Biden for a state visit to \ndiscuss new partnerships\n between the two countries.\nThe \nWall Street Journal\n reporter Evan Gershkovich, who has been detained by Russian officials on espionage charges that he denies, \nlost his appeal\n against pretrial detention.\nTropical Storm Bret is \nnearing the eastern Caribbean\n, moving at just below the speeds of a Category 1 hurricane.\nDispatches\nUp for Debate\n: Conor Friedersdorf reflects on \nJoe Rogan, RFK Jr., and the public debates worth having\n.\nExplore all of our newsletters here.\nEvening Read\n \n(Courtesy of MGM)\n \nThe Valley Girl, Like, Totally Deserved Better\n \nBy\n \nSoraya Roberts\n \n\u201cShe got a whole bunch of nothing in there,\u201d Frank Zappa sings in \u201cValley Girl,\u201d his 1982 novelty tune and the original source for a certain Southern Californian, well-to-do, teen-bimbo stereotype. Zappa, known for his satirical, experimental compositions, had been inspired to record the song with his kid, who imitated her private-school classmates on the recording. Referring to the region most associated with this vacuous figure, Zappa told David Letterman, \u201cIt\u2019s perhaps one of the most disgusting places on the face of the Earth, and I wrote this song about the values of the people in the San Fernando Valley.\u201d Such scorn remains a common reaction to the Valley-girl archetype. She no longer has to live in California or even be an adolescent, but she still represents a particular kind of frivolous suburbanite encouraged by a consumer society to do little more than shop, party, and tan. Other examples include Cher from \nClueless\n, Elle from \nLegally Blonde\n, the Kardashians, and any number of Real Housewives. Yet the Valley girl has always been an overly easy target\u2014and one film, released shortly after the Zappa single, understood that.\nRead the full article. \nMore From \nThe Atlantic\nSan Antonio, the Spurs, and me\nGenerative AI should not replace thinking at my university.\nCulture Break\n \n(FX)\n \nListen.\n Are we just too impatient for baseball?

    "subject": "What the Reddit protests are really about",
    "body": "Plus: Trump seems to be afraid, very afraid. \nWednesday, June 21, 2023 \n \n \nLora Kelley\n \nAssociate Editor\nFor more than a week now, Reddit moderators have been using the site\u2019s tools to protest proposed business changes. The stalemate reveals how much power the site\u2019s users have accumulated over the years\u2014and just how much the site depends on its moderators\u2019 free labor.\nFirst, here are three new stories from \nThe Atlantic:\nTrump seems to be afraid, very afraid.\nPixar\u2019s talking blobs are becoming more and more unsatisfying.\nThe Titanic sub and the draw of extreme tourism\nNot a Worker, Not a Customer\n \n(Rafael Henrique / LightRocket / Getty)\n \nView in browser\nIf you\u2019re looking for pictures of John Oliver, for some reason, I have a recommendation for you: The Reddit group r/pics. For the past several days, the r/pics forum, normally populated with food pictures and nature shots, has featured a steady drumbeat of photos of the comedian: John Oliver with his wife. John Oliver\u2019s face Photoshopped onto Spider-Man\u2019s body. John Oliver at a desk. John Oliver on his show. Indeed, the group\u2019s moderators have forbidden users from posting anything besides John Oliver photos.\nThis is more than just a fun stunt (though it is pretty fun for observers). It is one of the various creative ways that Reddit moderators have used their authority in recent days to register discontent with proposed changes to Reddit\u2019s business.\nFor the past 10 days, moderators of thousands of Reddit forums have been protesting the company\u2019s plans to charge third parties to run apps on the site. Last week, nearly 9,000 forums went dark for 48 hours. Some forums \nremain shut down\n this week, and others are continuing to disrupt the normal flow of posts through the pipelines of the platform.\nThe trouble began after, earlier this spring, Reddit said it would start charging some other companies for Application Programming Interface (or API) access. In April, the company \nframed upcoming changes\n as an effort to ensure that it would be compensated when AI companies scraped the site\u2019s reams of user-generated content. \nMore recently\n, changes have meant that some \nbeloved apps\n that make the site easier to use will be forced to shut down because of prohibitive expenses.\nReddit moderators can be forgiven for resenting changes that might make their lives harder. After all, they do a significant amount of work for free. Reddit\u2019s users, especially power users such as moderators, contribute in a big way to the quality and growth of the platform. They lead and nurture (and police) communities that gather around various interests, such as \nrelationships\n, parenting, plumbing, or weighing in on whether, in a given situation, a poster is \nthe asshole\n. The relationship between Reddit and its users is unique. The company places outsize responsibility on its volunteer moderators, but as a result, they also have outsize power\u2014which means that their coordinated actions can cause much disruption on the platform.\nModerators are not paid employees of the site. But they are not always customers, either\u2014though Reddit has a \npremium tier\n, many users don\u2019t pay to use the platform. Reddit, like many tech companies that provide free products, runs ads (cue the adage \u201cIf you\u2019re not paying for the product, you are the product\u201d). Now, with its new rules, the company is attempting to monetize the content that users\u2014and particularly moderators\u2014have been generating for free.\nBy protesting the changes, moderators are reminding Reddit just how much the site needs them\u2014and how much the moderators need third-party tools. \u201cMany Reddit moderators rely on third-party apps in order to do their jobs,\u201d my colleague Kaitlyn Tiffany, who reports on internet culture for \nThe Atlantic\n and recently wrote a great book about online communities and fandom, reminded me this morning. \u201cWithout them, they\u2019re rightfully concerned that their forums will be flooded with garbage.\u201d\nThe API debate has exposed broader fault lines on the site, Fraser Raeburn, a historian and Reddit moderator, told me. He said that Reddit should better acknowledge \u201cthe role volunteers play within it, in terms of curating content and keeping Reddit a relatively safe and functional part of the internet.\u201d The moderators of his forum, r/AskHistorians, have restricted posts on their forum as part of the protest. Raeburn said he hopes to see Reddit\u2019s leaders engage constructively with questions and clarify how they will handle the disruptions that come from losing some add-ons.\nSo far, things have been fractious. Reddit CEO Steve Huffman \ntold NBC\n last week that moderators were like \u201clanded gentry,\u201d and suggested that he might make changes that would allow users to vote moderators out. (When I asked Reddit for comment on the recent protests, I was directed to a \nblog post\n from last week on the API updates.) For now, moderators remain powerful.\nModerated communities are what have made Reddit distinctive as a platform, and as a result, helped it last. As Kaitlyn pointed out, \u201cReddit\u2019s model of empowering moderators has given the site a much longer shelf life than I think many would have thought possible 10 years ago.\u201d\nIt\u2019s not easy for a tech company to make a lot of money and make all of its users happy\u2014especially on a platform that has an open-source ethos. For all the talk among VCs and techies about the power of community, Reddit is demonstrating how fraught the community-based model can be. Especially as Reddit eyes a \npotential IPO\n, its corporate interests and user needs may clash.\nRaeburn told me he wants this resolved so that he can get back to the reason he\u2019s on the site: talking about history. But for now, he marvels at the way that the site\u2019s structure and culture made this type of action possible. \u201cReddit had to give us a degree of control over the site because they wanted us to do that work for them,\u201d Raeburn said. \u201cReddit, probably inadvertently, has created the structure for protest to succeed.\u201d\nRelated:\nReddit is finally facing its legacy of racism.\nInside r/relationships, the unbearably human corner of Reddit\nToday\u2019s News\nA \nProPublica report\n revealed that Supreme Court Justice Samuel Alito had \nfailed to disclose\n a 2008 luxury fishing trip with a wealthy conservative donor. Alito wrote \nan op-ed\n defending himself in \nThe Wall Street Journal\n.\nPresident Joe Biden \nreferred to Xi Jinping\n as a dictator at a campaign event in California.\nThe Federal Reserve is \nlikely to raise\n interest rates in the coming months, despite holding them steady last week.\nDispatches\nUp for Debate\n:\n Readers reflect on how media portrayals can sometimes \nbe at odds\n with their own life experiences.\nThe Weekly Planet\n:\n Car-rental companies are ruining EVs, \nSaahil Desai writes\n.

Sources: Bureau of Indian Affairs; Jamestown S\u2019Klallam Tribe / Tribal Museum.)\n \nBlood-Quantum Laws Are Splintering My Tribe\n \nBy\n \nLeah Myers\n \nEven though I am a citizen of the Jamestown S\u2019Klallam Tribe, because of my blood I may also be the last tribal member in my family line.\nMy tribe requires that members be at least one-eighth Jamestown S'Klallam by blood. Because I am exactly one-eighth, unless I have kids with another citizen, my kids will be ineligible to join. Regulations like this, known as blood-quantum laws, are used by many tribal nations to determine citizenship. They do this in the name of preservation, fearing that diluting the bloodline could mean diluting the culture. However, by enforcing these laws, tribal governments not only exclude some active members of their communities, but also may be creating a future in which fewer and fewer people will be eligible for citizenship.

    "subject": "Putin talks tough while Ukraine makes gains",
    "body": "Plus: the woman who bought a mountain for God \nTuesday, June 20, 2023 \n \n \nTom Nichols\n \nStaff writer\nThe Ukrainians are making progress in their long-awaited counteroffensive. Meanwhile, the Russian president is talking like a gangster and rattling the nuclear saber\u2014again.\nFirst, here are three new stories from \nThe Atlantic\n:\nThe woman who bought a mountain for God\nJustice comes for Hunter Biden.\nThe failure of affirmative action\nA Slow, Bloody Business\n \nView in browser\nWhile we\u2019re all distracted\u2014understandably\u2014by the \nspectacle\n of a former U.S. president under multiple criminal indictments, the war in Europe grinds on, consuming lives, burning cities, and threatening global peace. The Ukrainian counteroffensive is \nnow clearly under way\n, and Kyiv\u2019s forces are making incremental but concrete gains along the front. The Ukrainians are, for the moment, calm and confident; the Russians less so.\nUkrainian officials have been \ncautious in their evaluations\n of this early stage of the counteroffensive because they know it\u2019s going to be a long summer. \u201cHot battles continue,\u201d according to a statement from Deputy Defense Minister Hanna Maliar, and the situation is \u201cdifficult.\u201d Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky has acknowledged Russian counterattacks but \nsaid yesterday\n that no positions have been lost, while other areas have been \u201cliberated.\u201d\nRussian President Vladimir Putin, however, is talking tough\u2014which itself is a tell, a sign of how he thinks this war is going.\nPutin is trying to turn up the global temperature with some swagger about nuclear weapons. This past March, \nPutin said\n that he would base Russian nuclear weapons \nin Belarus\n, close to Ukraine. Moscow and Minsk have since \nsigned a formal agreement\n, and Putin \nnow claims\n that the first weapons have arrived in Belarus. This may or may not be true; Putin has \npreviously said\n that storage facilities for Russian warheads wouldn\u2019t be ready until July, and the Russian military is not exactly known for getting things done ahead of time, so it\u2019s unclear how much of this is (at this point) mere bluster. U.S. Secretary of State Antony Blinken \nsaid\n a few days ago that the United States does not \u201csee any indications that Russia is preparing to use a nuclear weapon\u201d\u2014which isn\u2019t quite the same thing as saying that the weapons haven\u2019t moved\u2014but also that America has \u201cno reason to adjust our own nuclear posture.\u201d\nPutin, meanwhile, \nsaid\n at the St. Petersburg International Economic Forum last week that he had no interest in returning to any conversations with the West about arms control. \u201cWe have more of these weapons than NATO countries do,\u201d he said in answer to an interviewer\u2019s question. \u201cThey know that, and they keep telling us to start negotiations on reductions. Well, you know, fuck \u2019em. As our people would say.\u201d\nCNN \ntried\n to render this Russian expression\u2014\n\u0445\u0440\u0435\u043d \u0438\u043c\n\u2014more gently, as \u201cshove it,\u201d but that\u2019s not even close. Putin has often used this kind of gangsterish tone when he\u2019s trying to project strength, especially to his own people in Russia. (He \nused\n similarly rough language, much to the Russian public\u2019s delight, when speaking of what he would to do to Chechen terrorists, using a phrase that, in American Mob idiom, would basically translate as a vow \u201cto whack them in their shithouses.\u201d)\nThe leader of a nuclear-armed power sounding like Tony Soprano is alarming, but Putin is likely emphasizing Russia\u2019s nuclear deterrent because his conventional forces have been repeatedly humiliated in combat. More to the point, although Russia still has a large military, Moscow has lost its best units and most highly trained officers and soldiers after a year of ghastly losses on the ground.\nSo what should we expect, and how should we think about this new phase in the war?\nFirst, Americans especially should put aside what they know about recent U.S.-led wars such as the campaigns in Iraq: There will be no gathering on a \u201cline of departure\u201d followed by a massive air, armor, and infantry blitz. Nor is this like D-Day, with men storming the beaches and overwhelming enemy pillboxes. The counteroffensive had no real \u201cbeginning,\u201d in that sense; the initial phase probably began with some tentative engagements against the Russians on the edges of Bakhmut shortly after Putin\u2019s forces \nfinally took what\u2019s left\n of the town a few weeks ago.\nSadly, the Ukraine war is now more like World War I: Both sides have settled in along a large, static line. The Russian high command has been dreading this Ukrainian counteroffensive since last winter, and so \nthe Russians have dug in\n, taking up defense positions inside fortifications and huddling in trenches that will have to be cleared out one by one. (The Ukrainians have already released footage of their soldiers fighting in Russian trenches.) The Ukrainians must now probe, feint, and strike where they can, while trying to attack and disrupt Russian supply and reinforcements waiting in the rear, farther back from the battlefield.\nSecond, there will be no official \u201cend\u201d to the counteroffensive, either. (Well, unless Russia sues for peace, I suppose, but Putin has no apparent interest in any of that.) War is an uncertain and contingent thing; as we teach students at our senior military colleges, the enemy gets a vote on your strategy. Luck always gets a say as well. Americans are used to conflicts in which the United States deploys a large force, seizes the initiative, and keeps it for as long as we wish. The Ukrainians have no such luxury.\nAlthough we should keep an eye on those Russian nukes (and whether Putin is really moving them), the real news in the coming weeks will be whether the Ukrainians can break through points along those Russian lines. The Russians are already engaging in savage counterattacks in an effort to blunt Ukrainian operations, and although sudden collapses and dramatic wins and losses on either side are always possible, the more likely story is one of Ukrainian progress measured by the names of small villages and the coordinates of grid squares on a map\u2014a slower and far bloodier business.\nAs for Putin\u2019s threats, the Russian president seems to be venting and showing off, which is one way to know that we are not yet in a crisis. When national leaders \nstop\n appearing in public, and both Moscow and Washington go quiet, \nthat\u2019s \na time to worry. Putin is indulging his usual vulgar sense of humor, and though Americans, like Russians, also have some colorful local expressions, it is better for the Americans and NATO to be the resolute adults in the room, as they have been since the beginning of this criminal Russian onslaught.\nRelated:\nThe true purpose of Ukraine\u2019s counteroffensive\nWhat happens if Russia stashes nukes in Belarus\nToday\u2019s News\nRescue crews are \ncontinuing the search\n for a submersible with five people aboard that went missing while traveling to tour the Titanic\u2019s wreckage.

Truman is a brand in a setting that is stridently generic. Since his birth, he has navigated a world manufactured\u2014by Christof, the creator of his show\u2014for lucrative inoffensiveness. Everything around him exists to fulfill the primary mandate of a mass-market TV show: appealing to the widest possible audience.\nThe Truman Show\n hits a snag, though, and the problem is Truman. As he grows up, he proves himself to be less a bland everyman than someone who is quirky and restless and, in the best way, kind of a weirdo. Truman is also unusually inquisitive\u2014a great quality for anyone who is not a piece of IP. Christof, consequently, has spent much of the show\u2019s run trying to squelch Truman\u2019s curiosity. He wants to be an explorer, an excited Truman tells a teacher. \u201cYou\u2019re too late,\u201d she replies, on cue. \u201cThere\u2019s really nothing left to explore.\u201d\nRead the full article. \nMore From \nThe Atlantic\nWhat we learned from autism\u2019s first child\nApple is an AI company now.\nThe feminists insisting that women are built differently\nThe bitter truth about the Bud Light boycott\nCulture Break\n \n(Illustration by The Atlantic*)\n \nRead.\n Robert Gottlieb, who edited Toni Morrison, Robert Caro, and others, died last week at 92.

But I have long been fascinated by how nuclear arms and fears of nuclear war seeped so deeply into our popular culture during the Cold War. (In fact, I used to teach a course about it at Harvard Extension School.) So if you\u2019re looking for a little light music to accompany your reading about nuclear issues\u2014such as this \narticle\n by me last year and another \nhere\n by my colleague Ross Andersen\u2014I \nhave a playlist\n for you.\nThis list won\u2019t include all your sentimental favorites\u2014sorry, fans of \u201c99 Red Balloons\u201d; we\u2019ve heard that one enough\u2014but there\u2019s some odd stuff here: Did you know that Bill Haley\u2019s \u201cRock Around the Clock\u201d was actually the \nflip side\n of a single about a nuclear war that leaves only one man and 13 women alive? (Bill sounds pretty happy about it.) And there are songs that even I didn\u2019t realize were about nuclear war, such as \u201cI Melt With You,\u201d a favorite from my college days that I thought was about \u201cmelting\u201d emotionally but, as it turns out, was about, you know, \nactually melting\n.\n \nEnjoy!\nYou\u2019ll see a bit less of me in the next few weeks as I complete my last tour teaching in Harvard\u2019s Summer School\u2014a bittersweet milestone that rounds out 35 years of my previous career as an educator. I will be taking time this summer to work on an updated version of \nThe Death of Expertise\n, in which I\u2019ll talk about how the rejection of expertise is a problem that has gotten much worse in recent years, even before the coronavirus pandemic.

    "body": "This Juneteenth, spend time with beautiful pieces of writing that highlight the fortitude of Black Americans. \nMonday, June 19, 2023 \n \nThis Juneteenth, spend time with six beautiful pieces of writing that highlight the fortitude of Black Americans throughout the country\u2019s history.\nView in browser\nOn June 19, 1865, two years after the signing of the Emancipation Proclamation, word reached Texas notifying enslaved people of their freedom. Juneteenth is a holiday honoring this delayed freedom. But it\u2019s not solely a day of celebration: Juneteenth also inspires reflection on all the work left to do to ensure the fullness of Black Americans\u2019 liberty.\nDespite a host of regional and statewide celebrations over the past century and a half, Juneteenth became recognized as a federal holiday only in 2021, when President Joe Biden signed a bill to that effect\u2014likely as a response to George Floyd\u2019s murder and the ensuing wave of organizing in 2020.\nThis year, I invite you to read six beautiful pieces of writing that offer a window into the state of Black America. In each of these stories, I am reminded of the fortitude of my enslaved ancestors, and of Black Americans\u2019 resistance to oppression at every point in this country\u2019s history.\nToday we remember those who fought for their freedom, and we reflect on ensuring that dream is fully realized. \u201cMemory is the purpose of Juneteenth,\u201d my colleague Vann R. Newkirk II \nwrote\n in 2019. \u201cOn Juneteenth, it seizes the narrative, reminding the country of its original debt, and the debts it has since accrued.\u201d\n\u2014 \nAmina Kilpatrick, assistant editor\nYour Reading List\n \nKerry James Marshall, \"Our Town,\" 1995 (Crystal Bridges Museum of American Art, Bentonville, Arkansas. Photo: Vancouver Art Gallery. \u00a9 Kerry James Marshall. Courtesy of the artist and David Zwirner, London)\n \nThe Truth About Black Freedom\n \nBy\n \nDaina Ramey Berry\n \nJuneteenth is a celebration of just one way that Black people either created freedom or found it, often on their own terms. What we acknowledge this Juneteenth must be about more than what was given. It must be about what had already been claimed. Enslaved people were always the first givers of their own liberty. They did not wait idly for proclamations and decrees. They stole fragments of liberty and created spaces of freedom within the institution of slavery, even before they were ever legally \u2018free.\u2019 They put down their rakes and hoes and rested on beds of hay; they stole afternoon naps while hanging tobacco; they held nighttime parties to dance away their pain, and they held prayer meetings in the woods to nourish their spirits with hope.\nRead the full article. \n \nHistorically, Juneteenth has not been widely recognized outside of black communities. (Library of Congress)\n \nBlack Joy\u2014Not Corporate Acknowledgment\u2014Is the Heart of Juneteenth\n \nBy\n \nKellie Carter Jackson\n \nThough holidays, symbols, statues, and flags matter, it will take more than increased recognition of Juneteenth to combat racism. If not followed with substantive change, the relatively recent scramble to acknowledge Juneteenth will just feel like virtue signaling, acts of solidarity that ring hollow.\nRead the full article. \n \n(Photograph by Aaron Turner; archival image from Library of Congress)\n \nStories of Slavery, From Those Who Survived It\n \nBy\n \nClint Smith\n \nFrom 1936 to 1938, interviewers from the [Federal Writers\u2019 Project] gathered the firsthand accounts of more than 2,300 formerly enslaved people in at least 17 states. \u2026 While many of these narratives vividly portray the horror of slavery\u2014of families separated, of backs beaten, of bones crushed\u2014embedded within them are stories of enslaved people dancing together on Saturday evenings as respite from their work; of people falling in love, creating pockets of time to see each other when the threat of violence momentarily ceased; of children skipping rocks in a creek or playing hide-and-seek amid towering oak trees, finding moments when the movement of their bodies was not governed by anything other than their own sense of wonder. These small moments\u2014the sort that freedom allows us to take for granted\u2014have stayed with me.\nRead the full article. \n \n(Carlos Javier Ortiz)\n \nThe Case for Reparations\n \nBy\n \nTa-Nehisi Coates\n \nHaving been enslaved for 250 years, black people were not left to their own devices. They were terrorized. In the Deep South, a second slavery ruled. In the North, legislatures, mayors, civic associations, banks, and citizens all colluded to pin black people into ghettos, where they were overcrowded, overcharged, and undereducated. Businesses discriminated against them, awarding them the worst jobs and the worst wages. Police brutalized them in the streets. And the notion that black lives, black bodies, and black wealth were rightful targets remained deeply rooted in the broader society. Now we have half-stepped away from our long centuries of despoilment, promising, \u2018Never again.\u2019 But still we are haunted.\nRead the full article. \n \nA daytime protest on June 11, 1964, of the slave market in St. Augustine, Florida (Associated Press)\n \nBalancing the Ledger on Juneteenth\n \nBy\n \nVann R. Newkirk II\n \nThe idea of reparations is somehow both avant-garde and extraordinarily old. Its reemergence stems from a broad reassessment of the trajectory of black America\u2019s material conditions, and a realization that even with the extraordinary efforts of individual black people and some political and economic protections, true equality always appears just out of reach.\nRead the full article. \n \n(Colby Deal / Magnum)\n \nConsidering \nRoe v.

    "body": "Entertainment musts from Maya Chung \nSunday, June 18, 2023 \n \n \nKelli Mar\u00eda Korducki\n \nSenior editor\nGood morning, and welcome back to The Daily\u2019s Sunday culture edition, in which one \nAtlantic\n writer reveals what\u2019s keeping them entertained.\nToday\u2019s special guest is \nMaya Chung\n, an associate editor on the Books team and a frequent contributor to our \nBooks Briefing newsletter\n. Lately, Maya has been enjoying the style and ambience of the French novelist Maylis de Kerangal, is still thinking about a recent exhibition of work by the surrealist 20th-century artist Meret Oppenheim, and is enjoying post-hype-cycle prestige TV, which includes the fourth and final season of \nSuccession\n.\nFirst, here are three Sunday reads from \nThe Atlantic\n:\nA star reporter\u2019s break with reality\nThe instant pot failed because it was a good product.\nThe fake poor bride\nThe Culture Survey: Maya Chung\n \n(Courtesy of HBO)\n \nView in browser\nThe upcoming event I\u2019m most looking forward to: \nI really hope to see the Shakespeare in the Park \nproduction\n of \nHamlet\n in New York\u2019s Central Park this summer. The early pandemic made me realize how much I\u2019d taken for granted living in a city with such incredible theater, so I\u2019ve been cherishing the experience of seeing live theater this past year. And there\u2019s nothing like Shakespeare in the Park\u2014whatever the play, it\u2019s a totally enchanting experience. This year it\u2019s a contemporary \nHamlet\n directed by the celebrated Kenny Leon, who also did this season\u2019s Tony-winning revival of \nTopdog/Underdog\n on Broadway. Setting Shakespeare in the modern day can sometimes be gimmicky, but when it\u2019s done right, it captures the magic of his work, and how enduring it remains. \n[Related: \nAll of Shakespeare\u2019s plays are about race.\n]\nThe television show I\u2019m most enjoying right now: \nI don\u2019t love watching shows when they\u2019re at the height of their popularity, because when there\u2019s a ton of chatter, I have a hard time figuring out what my actual, original thoughts are (and if I have any!). So I just finally started watching the fourth season of \nSuccession\n. Avoiding spoilers while working on the Culture desk here has been nearly impossible, and some of the big bombshells did slip through. But I\u2019m still savoring all of the delicious drama and insult-hurling. \n[Related: \nThe \nSuccession\n plot that explained the whole series\n]\nI\u2019m even more behind on \nThe Handmaid\u2019s Tale\n, which I also just started watching a couple weekends ago. The show came out in 2017, which wasn\u2019t \nthat\n long ago, but it has been really fascinating to watch it with a little bit of distance, especially given the political climate in which it premiered. Also, the performances are spectacular, and it\u2019s visually gorgeous.\n [Related: \nThe visceral, woman-centric horror of \nThe Handmaid\u2019s Tale\n]\nBest novel I\u2019ve recently read, and the best work of nonfiction:\n I read Maylis de Kerangal\u2019s short novella \nEastbound\n earlier this year, which is about a young Russian conscript who, once aboard the Trans-Siberian rail, decides to desert and meets a French woman who helps him. I haven\u2019t stopped thinking about it. I then read de Kerangal\u2019s book \nThe Heart\n, a similarly tense novel about the events and characters involved in a heart transplant\u2014including the young man who dies in an accident, the woman who receives his heart, and the doctors and bureaucrats who make the transplant possible. In recent years I\u2019ve sought out books for style and ambience rather than plot, perhaps because of my fickle attention span or perhaps after reading one too many plodding books. But de Kerangal reminded me how transportive it is when an author successfully creates that itching desire to know what happens next\u2014without forgoing an ounce of style.\nAs for nonfiction, I\u2019ve loved Christina Sharpe\u2019s \nOrdinary Notes\n, a book of fragmentary \u201cnotes\u201d\u2014which include memoir, theory, photos, and poetic musings\u2014about Black life in America. I\u2019ve been reading the book in blips and spurts over the past couple of months, which in some ways has felt like the best way to read it, because it\u2019s meant I\u2019ve been carrying Sharpe\u2019s intelligent, lyrical voice around with me.\nAn author I will read anything by: \nFor a long time I didn\u2019t have an answer to this, but as a books editor, you get asked this, or a version of this question, a lot. Though my answer will likely change, right now, it\u2019s Rachel Cusk and Rachel Ingalls. Two very different writers, both completely enrapturing and honest and intricate. \n[Related: \nRachel Cusk won\u2019t stay still.\n]\nThe last museum or gallery show that I loved: \nI loved seeing Meret Oppenheim\u2019s work at the \nMuseum of Modern Art\n earlier this year. I was previously uninitiated in her work but came away from the show entranced by her bleakness and her whimsy. My favorite part came near the end, where, across opposite walls on large sheets of paper, Oppenheim had made a blueprint for a retrospective of her work in Bern. For this, she drew tiny reproductions of her works so that the curators could see what order they should be displayed in. It made me strangely sad to see the artist\u2019s career captured two-dimensionally, in such miniature. But that\u2019s probably the wrong way to look at it; it\u2019s likely that Oppenheim was proudly looking back at her life\u2019s work, taking control of how exactly it should be consumed.\nThe last thing that made me snort with laughter: \nEven the title of Nicole Holofcener\u2019s new movie, \nYou Hurt My Feelings\n, made me snort\u2014I love a literal title. (When I encountered the similarly prosaic book title \nDogs That Know When Their Owners Are Coming Home\n, by the biologist Rupert Sheldrake, in this lovely \nprofile\n of his son, the mycologist Merlin Sheldrake, I knew I had to get my hands on a copy.) In the movie, a woman falls apart when she overhears her husband admitting that he doesn\u2019t like her new book. I\u2019m an editor, not a writer, so I was able to laugh heartily at this premise. But I could imagine that for my writer colleagues, this one might hit a little too close to home. \n[Related: \nYou Hurt My Feelings\n is a hilarious anxiety spiral.\n]\nThe Week Ahead\nSeason 2 of \nThe Bear\n (all episodes streaming on Hulu on Thursday)\nI Am Homeless If This Is Not My Home\n, Lorrie Moore\u2019s strange new novel, full of death but also the \nauthor\u2019s trademark humor\n (on sale Tuesday)\nAsteroid City\n, Wes Anderson\u2019s new film that shows the \ndirector at his best\n, according to our critic (in theaters everywhere Friday)\nEssay\n \n(Illustration by Ben Kothe / The Atlantic.

By the time my friend Alexis sent our group chat a podcast digging into the book that the theory\u2014which purports to explain what people desire from their romantic partners\u2014is based on, I was fairly certain that I\u2019d already heard everything I needed to know. I\u2019d seen the memes and read \nthe articles\n. The day before, I\u2019d even taken \nthe \nAtlantic\n quiz\n inspired by the proliferation of similar personality tests. But despite being able to name all five languages\u2014words of affirmation, quality time, physical touch, gifts, and acts of service\u2014I couldn\u2019t recall having ever encountered its source material, \nThe 5 Love Languages: The Secret to Love That Lasts\n. The love-language lore had transcended its origin point, making it feel like \u201csomething that started appearing in framed posters in Airbnbs starting in, like, 2015,\u201d as Michael Hobbes, an \nIf Books Could Kill \nco-host, notes in a recent episode.\nRead the full article. \nMore in Culture\nLong live the delightfully dumb comedy.\nPaul McCartney: I saw you standing there.\nKiller Mike\u2019s critique of wokeness\nAsteroid City \nis Wes Anderson at his best.\nWhat to read when you\u2019re feeling ambitious\nWhat\u2019s so funny about dying?\nCatch up on \nThe Atlantic\nJack Smith\u2019s backup option\nWhy Trump might just roll to the presidential nomination\nThe pregnancy risk that doctor\u2019s won\u2019t mention\nPhoto Album\n \nStunning Cephalopod: Aquatic Life Finalist.
