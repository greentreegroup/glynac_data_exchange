For future reference, you can find the \nrecording to our conversation here\n. \n\u00a0\nUnderstand there still may be some confusion on Outreach\u2019s solutions, and how they would directly apply to LCW\u2019s workflows. As I mentioned, it\u2019s difficult to align our value without the knowledge of what you are trying to solve for in your evaluation process. \n\u00a0\nMy recommendation to Daniel was that we set aside some time for a demo. From there, we can go through what a day-in-the-life in Outreach would look like for your teams, get clarity on your internal set-up of Salesforce/HubSpot, and better determine our fit. You can find my calendar link below to get that call scheduled. \n\u00a0\nSee available times\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\nRegarding the security and compliance documentation - we have plenty of resources for this, but it\u2019d be best to see that we are aligned on our solution offering prior to kicking off this paper process. \n\u00a0\nLet me know if you have any questions or concerns. Looking forward to continuing conversations. \n\u00a0\nBest,\nJosh",

What would be helpful is to ask your technical people to have a bullet list of all that they consider novel and worth protecting by a patent. It is likely to be a series of methods. For each method, ask them to list required inputs, the steps of the method, and the expected outcome. Also, ask them to note which part of the method is novel and not known to be used by others, in their opinion. Finally, avoid broad use of AI or machine learning terminology. Explain specifically how the steps of the method are accomplished. Ask them to avoid methods that can be reasonably argued as capable of being performed in a person's mind, with only pen and paper, or by a conventional use of a computer. Ask them to list specific practical application for the method - these are all the things that the patent office usually pushes back on. Once we have that list with marked-up steps and further details, please send that to me and we will get together for another discussion. Let me know if you have questions. Here is an example of a published application, not an issued patent yet, which gives you a flavor of what we are looking for. (\nhttps://patents.google.com/patent/US20240144141A1/en\n) This one also may be useful to look at (\nhttps://patents.google.com/patent/US20200311630A1/en\n) \nReply\n \nAlternatively, you can also respond by replying to this email. \n\u00a0\nGet the Upwork app and never miss another message. \nDownload now\n \nUnsubscribe\n \u00a0 | \u00a0 \nPrivacy Policy\n \u00a0 | \u00a0 \nContact Support\n \n655 Montgomery Street, Suite 490, Dpt 17022, San Francisco, CA 94111 \n\u00a9 2025 Upwork Inc.",

As a former Primary Patent Examiner with the USPTO with more than a decade of experience examining, I can offer \"behind the scenes\" insights into how patent applications are handled and reviewed. My area of expertise lies in prior art searching, claim interpretation, and in communication/education in regards to the patent process.\nI see that you are interested in someone with a law background, of which I do not have. Though I am very familiar with the legal aspects involved in regards to reviewing patents, offering actual legal advice and filing of claims, for example, is outside of my area of expertise. I want to be upfront about this in order to manage expectations.\nWhat I can offer, as mentioned above, is the unique perspective of how an examiner would approach your concept/invention in order to assist in how best to discern filing for a patent, if additional research/development may be needed, advising on how your product may align with what is already available, etc.\nIf you believe that I may be able to support your efforts in any capacity I am open to an initial discussion. If you do need someone that is e.g. a licensed attorney, then it may be best to look elsewhere.\nThank you again for reaching out and looking forward to a conversation if you believe I may be able to assist you.\nRegards,\nPaul C. \nReply\n \nAlternatively, you can also respond by replying to this email. \n\u00a0\nGet the Upwork app and never miss another message. \nDownload now\n \nUnsubscribe\n \u00a0 | \u00a0 \nPrivacy Policy\n \u00a0 | \u00a0 \nContact Support\n \n655 Montgomery Street, Suite 490, Dpt 17022, San Francisco, CA 94111 \n\u00a9 2025 Upwork Inc.",
