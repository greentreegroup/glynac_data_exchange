A suggestion is to look at a pragmatic approach in global organizations \u2013 how do you make change and institutionalize change in big and small country context, talk about how you\u2019re dealing with complex biases that are cultural biases, share specific examples, etc. Please look at your session description and see if this can be woven into the session and your proposed questions or if the session objectives need to be changed at all. \u00a0\n\u00a0\nAttached is the agenda draft as it stands today with a changed session title.\u00a0 \n\u00a0\nPlease look at options on LCW\u2019s calendar so we can get the panel on a call to discuss the session in the coming weeks. \n\u00a0\nI am in Greece for personal reasons this week, but I will be checking emails.
