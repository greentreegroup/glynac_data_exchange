    "body": "Celebrating 10 Years With Us!\nHaitian Creole In Digital Age: From Spoken Word \nTo Global Platforms.\n\u00a0\nBonjou Maria!\n\u00a0\nWhat is possible?\n When it comes to Haitian Creole in the digital age, the answer is more exciting than ever.\n\u00a0\nFor generations, Creole thrived in conversations, music, and storytelling. But now, it\u2019s making waves in spaces once thought unreachable\u2014on social media, in digital platforms, and across global networks. The demand for Creole is growing and\u00a0 transforming the way people connect, communicate, and claim their linguistic identity.\n\u00a0\nIn 2022, Creole Solutions played a pivotal role in this movement, helping one of the world\u2019s biggest tech companies localize their platform entirely in Creole. The result? A moment of pure joy and validation for countless Creole speakers who finally saw their language fully represented in the digital world.\n \nWhat is possible?\n \nHaitian Creole In The Digital Age!\nThe rapid rise in demand for\n Haitian Creole\n was an indication of major shifts in language use. Soon after their arrival, Haitian immigrants in the U.S. no longer relied on the stilted French they had learned in school and instead turned to Creole as their main language of communication.\u00a0\n\u00a0\nWith Creole already spoken and used in print, for example for tax forms, it was hardly a surprise that\n social media came next.\n\u00a0\nThousands of people began to exchange messages in Creole on social platforms. In 2022, \nCreole Solutions\n was selected by one of the giants in the social media business to help translate the entire user interface of their platform.\n\u00a0\nCreole was entering the digital age, and \nMarleen and her team\n were right in the middle of the effort. Many people had the same response when they first saw the fully localized interface in their own language: Tears of joy.\n\u00a0\n \nLocWorld\n is the leading conference for global business, translation, and localization\u2014bringing together experts shaping the future of language access. At LocWorld, Marleen Julien shared how\n Haitian Creole\n is making its mark in the digital world, including the launch of a social media platform fully accessible in Creole.\nCelebrate with Us!\n\u00a0\nWhat\u2019s Next?\nHaitian Creole is making strides in digital spaces. From social media platforms to online learning and business tools, the language is reaching more people than ever before. Creole is no longer just spoken\u2014it\u2019s written, shared, and embedded in the digital world.\n\u00a0\nEach month, we will highlight a new way Haitian Creole is expanding.\u00a0Let\u2019s continue the conversation. Share your thoughts and experiences\u2014because every step forward for Creole is a step toward greater access and visibility.\nLearn more about us\n \nStay in the loop!\nFor more updates and exciting news, make sure to follow our page and stay connected with us on social media.\u00a0\n \n \n \n \nCreole Solutions, 4957 Oakton Street, Suite 203, Skokie, IL 60076, United States \nManage preferences",

Experts from architectural and engineering firms, along with construction managers, evaluated District 214\u2019s buildings and identified key infrastructure needs, including HVAC systems, roofing, plumbing, classroom modernization and athletic facility updates. The assessment outlined more than $850 million in potential improvements, underscoring the need for strategic prioritization and funding solutions. The District\u2019s facilities were built decades ago, and while ongoing maintenance has kept them functional, larger-scale improvements are needed to ensure they continue meeting students\u2019 educational needs. \nExploring funding strategies\n \nElk Grove High School's student services area was renovated over the summer.\nWith major improvements necessary, the Board explored various funding options, including potential bond measures, grants and other financial strategies. The discussion focused on balancing the urgency of repairs with fiscal responsibility, ensuring that any funding approach is sustainable and minimizes impact on taxpayers. The Board is committed to maintaining financial stability while addressing the infrastructure needs of the district.\nLong-term planning for schools of the future\n \nThe new state-of-the-art culinary lab at Elk Grove High School was unveiled in the fall.\nIn addition to addressing immediate facility needs, the board discussed long-term strategic planning to modernize school buildings and create learning environments that align with evolving educational needs. Plans include reviewing spaces to support innovative teaching methods, integrating new technology, and improving energy efficiency across all facilities. Future projects may focus on upgrading science labs, expanding career and technical education facilities, and enhancing common areas to foster collaboration and student engagement.\nCommitment to safe and effective learning environments\n \nStudents can gather, meet college representatives and attend events at Elk Grove High School's new multi-purpose postsecondary center.\nThe Board reaffirmed its dedication to providing students with safe, well-maintained and innovative learning spaces. Investments in facilities are directly tied to student success, as modern, well-equipped classrooms contribute to engagement and achievement. The Board will continue evaluating priorities to ensure all schools remain state-of-the-art for current and future students.\nNext steps and community engagement\n \nBuffalo Grove High School's athletic fields are being upgraded and improved.\nThe Board will continue reviewing infrastructure needs and potential funding strategies in upcoming meetings. Community engagement will play a key role in determining the path forward, with opportunities for stakeholders to provide input on priorities. The District has issued a Request for Proposals (RFP) to identify a consultant to assist with the community engagement process. Stay tuned for further updates on how District 214 is planning for the future.\nRoll Call Action Items\nClick \nHERE\n to see documents related to the following Roll Call Action and Discussion items from the February 28 meeting:\n6.1.

    "body": "WLSP: The rising tide of LLMS\n \n \n \nWLSP: The rising tide of LLMs\n \nJoin us for a welcoming and insightful discussion on the rapidly growing world of Large Language Model (LLM) technology. This new technology is set to transform machine translation, translation evaluation methods and metrics, as well as ethical standards. Whether you\u2019re eager to embrace LLMs or still unsure, this session will bring you up to speed on the latest developments that every localization professional should know. By the end of this session, you\u2019ll be ready to navigate the rapidly evolving LLM landscape, whether you\u2019re ready to implement these tools or just want to better understand their potential impact.\nHere\u2019s what we\u2019ll cover:\nMetrics evolution\n: Learn which traditional metrics are becoming outdated with the rise of LLMs. We\u2019ll dive into new evaluation methods that focus on context and nuanced language, offering a more comprehensive view of translation quality.\nMitigating hallucinations\n: LLMs are powerful, but they come with challenges. We\u2019ll explore how to detect and minimize \u201challucinations\u201d\u2014instances where models generate incorrect or misleading information\u2014and examine ways LLMs are improving at self-correcting errors. This helps ensure more reliable and trustworthy translations.\nEmbracing opportunities\n: With diversity, equity, and inclusion (DEI) at the forefront of conversations today, we\u2019ll discuss how LLMs handle things like gender biases and their strengths and weaknesses in promoting inclusive translations.\nS\ufeffpeakers\nAlex Yanishevsky\n:\u00a0Senior Director of AI and Machine Translation,\u00a0Smartling\nAlex is the senior director of AI and machine translation at Smartling and has been in the localization industry for over 20 years.

We've long been asked by customers big and small for the ability to: \nBook flights, hotels, rail, and car rentals from inside the app.\nLimit what inventory employees see to only what is in the authorized travel policy.\nPay for these bookings using a central virtual card.\nCapture the travel receipts into an automatic expense report.\nCut travel costs\nIn \nNew Expensify\n, press the green + button \n> Book travel\n (or in \nExpensify Classic\n, click the \nTravel\n button along the left side of the screen).

We even connect the traveler and travel manager in a dedicated chat room to discuss all bookings and changes the instant they happen, rather than whenever you get around to checking your inbox.\nRealtime expense management,\n where every booking receipt and change fee is recorded as an expense that's submitted up through Expensify's realtime approval and next-day reimbursement engine: book today, get paid tomorrow!\nRealtime collaboration\n, where shared trip chat rooms are automatically created in New Expensify so that everyone is on the same page. From employees to managers, everything you need to know about your trip, all in one place. \nThe instant, chat-first design of New Expensify is why we like to say that Expensify does:\nTravel and expense at the speed of chat.\nTo check it out, open your Expensify app and click \nTravel\n, or take a peek below!\nIt's one of the most exciting times to be at Expensify that I can ever remember.

    "body": "Celebrating 10 Years of Learning\nwith us!\nBonjou Maria!\n\u00a0\nAs we continue celebrating Creole Solutions\u2019 10-year journey, this month\u2019s spotlight is on \nLearning\n, \none of the most powerful ways we\u2019ve seen Haitian Creole break barriers and open doors.\n\u00a0\nFor too long, higher education and professional research in Haiti were associated almost exclusively with French, leaving Haitian Creole on the sidelines. But that\u2019s changing, and Creole Solutions has played an active role in this shift.\nIn 2022, The United Nations launched its new website for Haiti in Haitian Creole.\nWhat is possible? \nLearning!\nHistorically, higher learning in Haiti has been associated with French, as Haitian Creole was considered a spoken language. That perspective has undergone quite a few changes in the last decade, and \nCreole Solutions\n is proud to have played a role in this shift.\n \n\u00a0\nWhat learning is and how it is accessed have evolved\n, with Haitian Creole gaining greater recognition. When the New York Times published an article on Haitian history in both English and Haitian Creole on May 23, 2022, it caused a sensation.\nLater in the same year, the \nUnited Nations\n launched its brand-new website for Haiti \nin beautifully crafted Haitian Creole. Marleen and her team have always felt strongly that Haitian Creole can only be elevated by prioritizing proper grammar and spelling. \nThese days, it is not uncommon for research institutes and museums to request translations from us.\u00a0\n\u00a0\nWe were honored to collaborate with the Museum of Contemporary Art to include Haitian Creole translations in \nDidier William: Nou Kite Tout Sa D\u00e8y\u00e8\n.\n This powerful book, published alongside William\u2019s largest solo museum exhibition, delves into race, immigration, and memory through his monumental paintings, printmaking, and sculpture.\n \nThe title, which translates to \nWe\u2019ve Left That All Behind\n, reflects the Haitian immigrant experience\u2014the journey of displacement, adaptation, and resilience. By incorporating Haitian Creole, we ensure that these narratives reach those who connect most deeply with them, reinforcing the idea that language should never be a barrier to understanding.\nIn Haitian culture, we say\n \nKrey\u00f2l pale, krey\u00f2l konprann\n\u2014\nwhen Creole is spoken, it is understood. When people have the opportunity to learn and engage in their own language, knowledge becomes more accessible, voices are amplified, and communities thrive.\n \nCelebrate with Us!\n\u00a0\nFrom academic research to museum exhibitions, our language is breaking barriers and creating new opportunities. Every translation, publication, and collaboration brings us closer to a future where\n Creole is not just spoken but recognized, studied, and celebrated.\n\u00a0\nWhat\u2019s Next?\nEach month, we\u2019ll share another story of what\u2019s possible with Haitian Creole, celebrating the growth, creativity, and cultural pride that Creole Solutions has brought to life over the past decade.\n\u00a0\nJoin us in championing Haitian Creole as a language of learning, knowledge, and innovation. Share your thoughts, stories, and experiences with us\u2014because when \nKrey\u00f2l pale, krey\u00f2l konprann\n, anything is possible!\nLearn more about us\n \nStay in the loop!\nFor more updates and exciting news, make sure to follow our page and stay connected with us on social media.\u00a0\n \n \n \n \nCreole Solutions, 4957 Oakton Street, Suite 203, Skokie, IL 60076, United States \nManage preferences",

Prospect Snowball students lead the pledge\nCheck this out: \nStudents from Prospect High School\u2019s Operation Snowball program led the Pledge of Allegiance at the January 23 board meeting. This powerful peer-led retreat helps students build connections, encourage personal growth and create a strong sense of community. Several students spoke about their experiences, sharing how Snowball has been life-changing by fostering new friendships and providing a space to be their authentic selves.\n2. Opening doors in healthcare careers\nMaking a difference: \nThe Board of Education recognized Bright Light Medical Imaging for its outstanding support of District 214 students in the Healthcare Pathway. Through hands-on learning in radiology, ultrasound, MRIs and CT scans, Bright Light provides students with real-world experience and mentorship that inspires many to pursue careers in healthcare.\nBy opening their doors to interns and work-based learning opportunities, Bright Light Medical Imaging is making a lasting impact on our students\u2019 futures. Thank you!\n3. Vision 2030 shapes Illinois education\nThe big news: \nThe Board of Education has endorsed \nVision 2030\n, a statewide initiative focused on preparing students for success in an evolving world. This effort, led by the Illinois Association of School Boards (IASB) and the Illinois Association of School Administrators (IASA), prioritizes future-focused learning, student well-being and equitable funding while ensuring local control remains in the hands of districts.\nGo deeper:\n Developed with input from over 1,000 stakeholders, including educators, policymakers and business leaders, Vision 2030 aims to provide students with the skills, resources and opportunities they need to thrive. District 214 is proud to be part of this movement, helping to shape the future of K-12 education in Illinois.\n4. Strengthening support for students\nTransportation efficiency improvements:\nThe Board approved updates to the District\u2019s transportation contract, saving between $1 million and $1.5 million annually. Adjustments to late and early-out shuttles, route combinations and activity buses will reduce costs while maintaining service for students.\nSummer Experience \nThe Summer Experience Program for 2025 will be hosted at Rolling Meadows High School, with extended school year (ESY) classes taking place at Forest View Educational Center. The program will run in two sessions: the first from June 9 to June 26, and the second from July 7 to July 24, running Monday through Thursday (except 6/20). To account for rising costs, course fees, which have remained at $187.50 since 2020, will increase to $211 this year and will continue to adjust annually. Transportation fees, which have remained unchanged since 2013, will increase from $42 to $84, though the actual cost per student is $173.\nFoundation Memorandum of Understanding\nThe Board of Education approved the Memorandum of Understanding (MOU) between District 214 and the District 214 Education Foundation, which outlines their ongoing collaboration to support education, innovation and student success through financial and community resources.\nThe Foundation, an independent 501(c)(3) nonprofit, operates separately from the District but aligns with its strategic goals by funding creative teaching programs, student development initiatives and fostering partnerships. The District provides operational support, including office space, equipment and administrative services at no cost to the Foundation.\n5.

I am developing a blended learning program for new-to-instructional design professionals who may be SMEs, trainers, or experts in a related field. While there are some excellent academic and professional programs available in instructional design, my experience is that there are people doing the work who need practical help while developing the skills needed for the future.\nAt this point, I estimate the ID for Newcomers program participants (8\u201310) will meet on Zoom weekly to share their work, provide critique, discuss the articles, tools, and resources provided, and plan next steps. Each person will be asked to bring a current project and apply the skills they learn to the course or program they are designing. They would have 2-3 one-on-one meetings with an instructional design expert to provide them guidance.\n......\nThank you in advance for your thoughts. I appreciate any practical resources you might recommend. I hope to have the program, or series of discreet courses, ready to pilot starting in Spring 2025. If you know of someone you\u2019d want to send to a pilot, please let me know.\nBest regards,\nSusan Guest.\nUPCOMING EVENTS & LIVE DISCUSSIONS\nThese sessions feature experts sharing the latest research and insights on navigating leadership challenges, leveraging AI, and boosting retention\n. \nRegister now\n \nto secure your spot!\n \n \nExplore Upcoming Events | Fresh Ideas & Discussions\n \nAccess Our On-Demand Talent Solutions\nOur \nELE Insights\n lets you learn on-demand from your peers either on your computer or mobile devices.

I am developing a blended learning program for new-to-instructional design professionals who may be SMEs, trainers, or experts in a related field. While there are some excellent academic and professional programs available in instructional design, my experience is that there are people doing the work who need practical help while developing the skills needed for the future.\nAt this point, I estimate the ID for Newcomers program participants (8\u201310) will meet on Zoom weekly to share their work, provide critique, discuss the articles, tools, and resources provided, and plan next steps. Each person will be asked to bring a current project and apply the skills they learn to the course or program they are designing. They would have 2-3 one-on-one meetings with an instructional design expert to provide them guidance.\n......\nThank you in advance for your thoughts. I appreciate any practical resources you might recommend. I hope to have the program, or series of discreet courses, ready to pilot starting in Spring 2025. If you know of someone you\u2019d want to send to a pilot, please let me know.\nBest regards,\nSusan Guest.\nUPCOMING EVENTS & LIVE DISCUSSIONS\nThese sessions feature experts sharing the latest research and insights on navigating leadership challenges, leveraging AI, and boosting retention\n. \nRegister now\n \nto secure your spot!\n \n \nExplore Upcoming Events | Fresh Ideas & Discussions\n \nAccess Our On-Demand Talent Solutions\nOur \nELE Insights\n lets you learn on-demand from your peers either on your computer or mobile devices.

    "body": "Celebrating 10 Years of Creole Solutions:\nJanuary Spotlight: How Translators Found Careers and Community\nBonjou Maria!\n\u00a0\nWhen we checked, it was hard to believe: \nCreole Solutions is turning 10 this year\n, and there are so many reasons to celebrate!\n\u00a0\nWhen Marleen realized in 2015 that it was time to step up her freelance work and expand the scope of what she could do, she asked herself: \nWhat is possible with Haitian Creole?\n\u00a0\nAs it turned out, there were quite a few possibilities!\n\u00a0\nAs part of our \nyearlong anniversary celebration\n, we\u2019re launching the \n\u201cWhat\u2019s Possible with Haitian Creole\u201d series.\n Each month, we\u2019ll explore one of the incredible ways Creole Solutions has helped push the boundaries of what\u2019s possible with Haitian Creole.\nJanuary - What is possible?\u00a0\nJob growth.\n \nThe 2010 earthquake in Haiti and the political turmoil that followed led to a surge in demand for translations into Creole. As Haitians arrived in the US in large numbers, there were only a handful of qualified translators available to meet the enormous language needs of the group.\n\u00a0\nAlmost overnight, Marleen had to find ways to expand and qualify a team that met her rigorous standards.\n\u00a0\nAs project after project rolled in and the calls just wouldn\u2019t stop, Marleen took it upon herself to train a handful of promising Haitian translators. She showed them how to work efficiently with translation software, wrote grammar guides, and developed terminology lists. - She \nrevised\n,\n \nt\naught\n, and \nmentored tirelessly\n.\n\u00a0\nTen years later, she oversees a growing team of translators and interpreters who have become experts in their areas of expertise. From translating essential documents to interpreting during critical health and legal situations, this team has impacted countless lives while breaking barriers and building understanding.\nOver the past decade, the company has trained, supported, and empowered hundreds of translators and interpreters to thrive professionally while contributing to the rich tapestry of Haitian Creole language and culture.\n \nSmith, shown here, was one of the first team members to join Creole Solutions.\n \nMarleen conducting a remote meeting with the team.\nCelebrate with Us!\nAs part of our celebration, we\u2019ve captured stories from our team of translators and interpreters across the US, Haiti, and the Dominican Republic. Hear directly from them about what Creole Solutions has meant for their careers, their communities, and their connection to the Haitian language.\n \nWhat\u2019s Next?\nEach month, we\u2019ll share another story of what\u2019s possible with Haitian Creole, celebrating the growth, creativity, and cultural pride that Creole Solutions has brought to life over the past decade\nWant to learn more or join the celebration? Follow us on social media, visit our website.\n\u00a0\nStay tuned for more stories and events as we celebrate 10 amazing years of making Creole count.\u00a0\nLearn more about us\n \nStay in the loop!\nFor more updates and exciting news, make sure to follow our page and stay connected with us on social media.\u00a0\n \n \n \n \nCreole Solutions, 4957 Oakton Street, Suite 203, Skokie, IL 60076, United States \nManage preferences",
