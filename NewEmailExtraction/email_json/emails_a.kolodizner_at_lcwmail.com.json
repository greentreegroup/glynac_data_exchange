Payroll is running those corrections to ensure you pay the correct amount to each tax jurisdiction where you're liable for payroll taxes.\nWhen we do reconciliations, we look for variances between what we collected in taxes from your pay runs in the quarter and what the tax agencies expect you to pay. In some cases, we'll find variances between these two amounts. Variances are normal, and can be the result of a number of things.\nHere's a snapshot of where you stand, and what will happen next:\nFor your Full-Service jurisdictions, we will automatically create pay runs in your account and you'll see the following net amount \ncredited to \nyour bank account ending in ******6303 by April 07, 2025 for $0.05 for Unemployment Tax.\nFor additional details, please feel free to review your \nTax Payments report\n from your Payroll app.\nThanks, \nTriNet \nQuestions or concerns?

It commemorates the birth, enlightenment, and passing of Siddhartha Gautama, known as the Buddha.

    "body": "\u00ad \nApril 4, 2025 - Issue #6\n \n\u00ad \n \n\u00ad \n \n \nWEEKLY\u00a0\nGUIDANCE\nABOUT PROJECT FORWARD\nLed by BRIDGE, Project FORWARD is a cross-industry initiative, designed to chart our collective path forward and meet the current moment head-on. In partnership with top experts in academia, law and our board members, we are dedicated to equipping, educating, and empowering leaders in diversity, equity and inclusion (DEI), marketing, and business to continue to drive inclusive innovation and sustainable growth.\n\u00a0\nEvery Friday, Project FORWARD provides critical updates on executive orders (EO) and legislative developments, featuring legal interpretations from \nStacy Hawkins, Esq\n.\n, Diversity & Employment Practices Consultant and Rutgers Professor of Law, and \nJessica Golden Cortes\n, Partner, Labor + Employment Group, Davis+Gilbert LLP. We will also include the BRIDGE POV and tangible actions to consider.*\n\u00a0\nWe encourage our community to remain informed and proactive. If you have questions or insights you\u2019d like to share, please email \nprojectforward@wearebridge.com\n.\n\u00a0\nFOR PAST ISSUES OF PROJECT FORWARD WEEKLY GUIDANCE \nPLEASE VISIT HERE\n.\n\u00a0\n*These Project FORWARD updates should not be construed as legal advice or counsel. They are for educational and instructive purposes only, to aid our understanding about how best to actively continue our mission in response to this moment.\u00a0\nPROJECT FORWARD TOP 10\n\u00a0\nAs we have seen over the past weeks, things change day-by-day, minute-by-minute so it\u2019s important to stay pragmatic and focused versus chaotic and reactionary.\u00a0\n\u00a0\nHere\u2019s a Project FORWARD Top 10 to consider during this time:\n1 - \nNO STIGMA TO EVOLVING:\n In the same way that all business practices evolve, there should be no stigma attached to evolving DEI practices. Despite the collision with politics, the evolution of DEI practices should be subject to the same rigor as other business practices - figure out what\u2019s working and what isn\u2019t, strengthen its attachment to business impact and mitigate risk.\n\u00a0\n2 -\n CONNECT TO BUSINESS OUTCOMES:\n Beyond ensuring full compliance with existing laws, the most powerful way to mitigate risk is to broaden your inclusion efforts across the organization - intentionally tying them to business outcomes and marketplace impact.\n\u00a0\n3 -\n \nDRIVING BUSINESS GROWTH: \nInclusion can be transformational in driving business growth, especially when activating historically untapped communities whose buying power continues to grow in scale and influence (estimated at $6 Trillion).\n\u00a0\n4 - \nSEE, SERVE AND SHOW UP IN THE MARKET: \nConsider your inclusion maturity through a growth lens of how you see, serve and show up in the marketplace.\n\u00a0\n5 - \nCOMPLIANCE WITH TITLE VII: \nThe Civil Rights Act, and the legal protections it affords, remains unchanged! Continue to review your DEI Practices to ensure that they are compliant with Title VII. For example: internships are open to all applicants, mentorships open to all employees, allies are invited to attend ERGs, etc.\n\u00a0\n6 -\n EXECUTIVE ORDERS ARE NOT LAW: \nAn EO is a directive for how the federal government must act under the law. In and of itself, it does not have the force of law; therefore, EOs can be overturned if they violate federal or constitutional law.\n\u00a0\n7 - \nMERIT AND DEI AREN\u2019T MUTUALLY EXCLUSIVE: \nThe assertion that merit-based hiring is contrary to DEI practices is a false narrative. DEI practitioners have not advocated for hiring unqualified individuals\u2014the role of DEI is to break the systemic structures that have historically excluded qualified talent and expand opportunities to those who have been arbitrarily denied access. Merit and DEI have never been mutually exclusive.\n\u00a0\n8 - \nCOMMIT TO YOUR VALUES: \nYou cannot please everyone so committing to your company values versus capitulating to the politics of the moment is essential in maintaining trust in your brand. These values guide your mission, goals, culture, decision-making, behaviors, and relationships, serving as a foundation for how your company operates and interacts with employees, customers, and the broader community.\u00a0\n\u00a0\n9 - \nZERO-TOLERANCE POLICY: \nClearly define a zero-tolerance policy for all forms of discrimination and harassment - ensure it is clearly communicated to your employees.\n\u00a0\n10 -\n TRANSPARENCY IN COMMUNICATIONS: \nBe proactive and transparent in your communications to address questions and to reassure employees, especially those that belong to communities directly targeted, that the recent actions by the federal government do not override their protections under existing law or otherwise undermine the employer's commitment to support them.\n\u00ad \nUPDATE ON PREVIOUSLY ISSUED EXECUTIVE ORDERS\nFor continued reference these are the EOs targeting DEI and LGBTQ+ protections that have been issued:\nEnding Radical and Wasteful Government DEI Programs and Preferencing: Executive Order # 14151\nEnding Illegal Discrimination and Restoring Merit-Based Opportunity: Executive Order # 14173\nDefending Women from Gender Ideology Extremism and Restoring Biological Truth to the Federal Government: Executive Order #14168\n\u00a0\nOVERVIEW\nOn Friday, March 28, 2025, in response to a suit filed by Chicago Women in Trade, a federal judge in Illinois issued \na temporary restraining order blocking the Department of Labor from implementing a key provision of Trump's executive order\n # 14173 aimed at requiring federal grant recipients and contractors to certify that they do not operate Diversity, Equity and Inclusion (DEI) initiatives in violation of Trump's anti-DEI orders.\n\u00a0\nJudge Matthew Kennelly of the US District of Illinois \nruled the certification requirement is unconstitutionally vague and, coupled with the threat of financial penalties, would likely violate free speech rights.\n The preliminary injunction motion is set for an in-person hearing next Thursday, April 10, 2025.\u00a0\n\u00a0\nThe\u00a0\npushback against Trump's anti-DEI agenda has extended to European governments and businesses.\n According to a NY Times article from April 2, 2025, American Embassies in several countries sent letters to foreign contractors instructing them to certify their compliance with Trump\u2019s policies aimed at unraveling diversity programs. These letters drew \nsharp reactions from European companies and officials, who see them as part of a broader pressure campaign by the administration to export anti-diversity policies abroad.\n\u00a0\nThe European governments and businesses say these demands compromise their deep commitments to DEI, conflict with local laws, and violate international law/treaties.\n\u00a0\nLEGAL INTERPRETATION\nThe temporary restraining order issued on an emergency basis, applies specifically to the contractor certification requirement under Executive Order #14173. The district court has set the case for expedited briefings and hearings to determine, by the end of April, if the emergency order will be extended during the pendency of the litigation. Even if extended by the district court, this injunction may be appealed by the administration.\n\u00a0\nWhile this order \ntemporarily blocks the Department of Labor from requiring federal contractors to certify their DEI programs\n\u2014effectively overriding the 4th Circuit\u2019s stay on that point\u2014it leaves intact the 4th Circuit\u2019s ruling on the other two provisions challenged in the Baltimore case. As a result, the Trump administration may continue canceling \u201cequity-related grants and contracts\u201d and enforcing civil rights laws against so-called \u201cillegal DEI or DEIA practices.\u201d\n\u00a0\nBRIDGE POV\nNavigating the fluctuating legal landscape surrounding these EOs, especially the \u201cping pong\u201d effect of shifting court rulings, requires a strategic and clear-headed approach.\u00a0\n\u00a0\nThis is further intensified by the administration\u2019s recent directives to European companies, pressuring them to abandon their Diversity, Equity, and Inclusion (DEI) initiatives. In addition to\n igniting significant diplomatic tensions,\n these directives\n pose complex challenges for multinational corporations.\n Rightfully, \nEuropean officials have pushed back forcefully,\n viewing the move as both \nan overreach of US authority, and a violation of their own\u00a0anti-discrimination laws. \nAs a result \nglobal companies now face a precarious balancing act \nto preserve government contracts while honoring DEI commitments in regions where such principles are \nnot only culturally embedded, but legally protected.\u00a0\n\u00a0\nThe situation underscores the intricate interplay between national policies and international business operations, compelling corporations to reconcile a landscape \nwhere political dogma and corporate values may be at odds.\u00a0\u00a0\nCollaborate with legal counsel and your DEI professionals\n to determine \ncompliance obligations while adhering to global values\n and employee expectations\nContinue to \nstay informed on legal developments\n - challenges and rulings - related to the Executive Orders. A good understanding of the legal context will allow you to make sound business decisions to \nmitigate risk without compromising business opportunity.\nMaintain \nopen lines of communication with all stakeholders\n about any evolution to your DEI practice - clearly \narticulate the reason for adjustments while reaffirming a commitment to fostering an inclusive workplace and marketplace\n (actions must align to the commitment)\n\u00a0\nADDITIONAL RESOURCES\nA federal judge temporarily blocks parts of Trump's anti-DEI executive orders | AP News\n\u00a0\nU.S. Seeks to Calm Tempest in Europe Over Trump\u2019s Anti-Diversity Policies - The New York Times\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\nChicago Women in Trades v. Trump, et al\n.\u00a0\nMOUNTING RESISTANCE\nMounting resistance to the Trump Administration\u2019s coordinated efforts - through Executive Orders and various Agency actions - to weaponize the rule of law\n\u00a0\nOVERVIEW\nOver the past week, leaders in higher education, the legal profession, professional associations and state government officials\n have all publicly condemned the Trump Administration\u2019s efforts to weaponize the rule of law \n- using threats, intimidation, and coercion to pressure institutions and businesses into abandoning DEI initiatives under \nthe threat of political retribution, despite no legal requirement to do so.\u00a0\n\u00a0\nAs the 79 law school deans asserted: \u201cWe write to reaffirm basic principles: \nThe government should not punish lawyers and law firms for the clients they represent,\n absent specific findings that such representation was illegal or unethical. Punishing lawyers for their representation and advocacy violates the First Amendment and undermines the Sixth Amendment.\u201d\n\u00a0\nThere is a divide in the legal community about how to respond to Trump\u2019s efforts to settle scores with political opponents represented by the law firms. Three firms \u2013 Perkins Coie, Jenner & Block, and WilmerHale \u2013 \nhave all sued and successfully gotten court orders to at least partially block the executive orders.\n Wilmer Hale was clear on their position,\u00a0 \u201cThe Executive Order targeting our firm is a \nplainly unlawful attack on the bedrock principles of our nation\u2019s legal system\u2014our clients\u2019 right to counsel and the First Amendment\n. The terms of a nearly identical Executive Order have already been enjoined by a federal judge and today we have filed for immediate relief to protect the rights of our clients. We are bringing the dedication, expertise, and values that have served a wide range of clients in matters against administrations of both parties for decades to ensure their and our rights are upheld.\u201d\u00a0\n\u00a0\nOn April 2, 2025, Perkins Coie filed a motion asking the Court to permanently block enforcement of the unlawful Executive Order targeting our firm: \u201cSince our initial filing, we have made clear our resolve in protecting our firm, safeguarding the interests of our clients, and upholding the rule of law.\u201d\n\u201cThe Executive Order \nthreatens core constitutional principles and freedoms that all Americans hold dear\n, and the Court has already found that we are likely to succeed in our challenge.\u201d\n\u00a0\nLEGAL INTERPRETATION\nThese open letters, along with the legal challenges already filed against the Trump DEI Executive Orders reflect\n a coordinated response\u00a0 from members of the legal profession - who are sworn to uphold the rule of law \n- against the \nadministration\u2019s attempts to weaponize it for political and ideological ends.\u00a0\n\u00a0\nThis collective action signals \ngrowing sense of public outrage\n over the administration\u2019s \ncoercive tactics and is likely to galvanize broader resistance \nto its ideological agendas and extra-legal demands beyond the federal sector.\n\u00a0\nBRIDGE POV\u00a0\nAn attack on DEI is an attack on business and innovation. Additionally, \nall companies have an obligation to respond to the administration\u2019s attempt to weaponize the rule of law with moral clarity, a principled resolve and a firm commitment to their stated values.\n When the law is weaponized, the private sector becomes not just an economic actor, but a civic one.\nStand on principle not pressure\n - companies should resist politically motivated coercion that demands abandonment of Diversity, Equity and Inclusion or other lawful, values driven practices. Upholding these commitments to ethical governance demonstrates strength and leadership.\nSeek legal guidance but don\u2019t hide behind it\n - while staying compliant with the law is essential, companies must recognize the difference between legal obligation and political intimidation.\nCollaborate and speak collectively\n - there is power in numbers. Companies don\u2019t have to stand alone - forming coalitions across industries can help dilute risk with strengthening a shared defense of values on a global scale.\nEXECUTIVE ORDER # 14253\nRestoring Truth and Sanity to American History: Executive Order #14253\n\u00a0\nOVERVIEW\nOn March 27, 2025, Trump signed an executive order titled: \"Restoring Truth and Sanity to American History.\" This directive \nmandates the removal of what it terms \u201cimproper, divisive or anti-American ideology\u201d from federal institutions, notably targeting the Smithsonian institution.\u00a0\n\u00a0\nThe Executive Order accuses prior Administrations of using public monuments, museums, and other public sites, dedicated to memorializing the country\u2019s true history, of promoting\u00a0 a \u201ccorrosive ideology\u201d that it claims distorts history by portraying America\u2019s founding as \u201cinherently racist, sexist, oppressive, or otherwise irredeemably flawed.\u201d\u00a0\n\u00a0\nThe Order cites examples where racism, sexism or transgender historical figures are acknowledged and directs those overseeing these spaces to remove such narratives and instead\u00a0 \u201chonor the richness of American history and innovation,\u201d and \u201cinstill pride in the hearts of all Americans.\u201d\n\u00a0\nThis move follows Trump's broader push to exert sweeping controls over cultural institutions, such as the Kennedy Center - undermining their ability to serve the public interest and fulfill their mission to advance art and history.\u00a0\n\u00a0\nLEGAL INTERPRETATION\nThis Executive Order \nechoes the anti-CRT movement \nlaunched by Christopher Rufo in 2020, which led to federal and state actions like Trump\u2019s anti-DEI training order and Florida\u2019s Stop-WOKE Act. These efforts \naimed to suppress discussions of racism, sexism, and structural inequality in education and the workplace.\n\u00a0\nCritics further argue that this executive order \neffectively seeks to erase significant aspects of American history by downplaying or eliminating narratives related to slavery, segregation, and systemic racism.\n By promoting a more \u201cpatriotic\u201d and less critical portrayal of the nation\u2019s past, the order is seen as \nan attempt to whitewash history and suppress discussions on the complexities and struggles that have shaped the United States.\u00a0\u00a0\n\u00a0\nThis move has also sparked concerns \namong historians and civil rights advocates, who view it as an effort to control cultural narratives and diminish the recognition of marginalized communities\u2019 contributions to American history.\u00a0\n\u00a0\nBecause the Order targets federally-owned spaces under direct presidential control, \nlegal challenges are unlikely to succeed.\n However, \nCongress retains oversight authority and could scrutinize any actions\n taken under the Order to ensure alignment with public interest and statutory mandates.\n\u00a0\nBRIDGE POV\u00a0\n\u200b\u200bThis is when the \nprivate sector and other civic actors must step in to fill the growing void in our collective national narrative\n. As the\n federal government moves to erase or obscure the histories of marginalized communities\n, businesses, philanthropic organizations, media platforms and others have an opportunity\u2014indeed, \na responsibility \u2014 to preserve and amplify these stories.\u00a0\n\u00a0\nTruth in history is not just a moral imperative, it is foundational to a functioning democracy\n. A society that cannot confront its past cannot create a rich future.\n\u00a0\nIn moments when the state retreats from this truth, civic society must step forward\u2014\nnot just to resist erasure, but to actively shape a more honest, representative, and resilient national story.\n\u00a0\nThe private sector must\n not remain neutral in this moment\n - their \nobligation is to their employees and consumers, many of whom are witnessing their histories erased \nthrough the dismantling of narratives, monuments, artworks and more\nSupport museums, archives, universities and grassroots organizations \ncommitted to telling the full story of American history\n, including the experiences of marginalized communities. Strategic philanthropy can preserve this important part of our foundation and help institutions remain resilient in the face of political pressure.\nIntegrate inclusive storytelling into your brand platforms \n- use advertising, content marketing, social media and internal communications to elevate the historical narrative of underrepresented communities. Work with your DEI practitioners to ensure authentic representation and the avoidance of stereotypes.\nContinue\n investing in historically grounded education of factual contextual history\n to ensure the workforce becomes a \nliving archive of inclusive knowledge\n\u00a0\nADDITIONAL RESOURCES\nHistorians Defend the Smithsonian - AHA\nCOMMUNITY EVENTS\nBRIDGE invites everyone to join for our \nmonthly Community Calls\n which take place on the last Thursday of every month, gathering DEI marketing, and business leaders committed to driving systemic change within our organizations and the industry at large.\n\u00a0\nOur next call is \nThursday, April 24th from 12-1p ET\n.\nADD CALL TO CALENDAR\n \nBRIDGE25: FORWARD\n, our annual 2 1/2 day retreat will convene close to 200 of the top DEI, Marketing & Business Leaders at the stunning Seabird Resort overlooking the beach in \nOceanside, CA, May 4-6.\nOur commitment is to deliver and experience that will be \nunapologetically indelible, determined and audacious!\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\nSpots are limited so please don't wait to sign up!\nREQUEST AN INVITE\n \n \n\u00ad \n \n\u00ad \n \n \nBRIDGE\n1276 Auto Park Way Suite D, PMB 183, Escondido, CA 92029\nThis email was sent to\u00a0a.kolodizner@lcwmail.com\nYou've received it because you've subscribed to our newsletter.\nUnsubscribe",

Fighting Computer Scammers\nLast month, I was working on two separate laptops on different projects when I noticed one was flooded with announcements. Your computer has been compromised! Russians are trying to access your files! You have downloaded seven viruses!\nI wasn\u2019t sure what I had done to cause this, but rather than click any buttons or links or call the phone number I was instructed to call, I called our office\u2019s head of information technology.\nHe was able to determine that no information was lost, no files were stolen, and no money went missing because we had good protections in place, took quick action, and didn\u2019t fall for the scammers\u2019 tricks. Most people don\u2019t have an IT department with cybersecurity professionals on call, however.\nThis point was driven home to me a couple of weeks later when a senior citizen told me a similar story, but with a far more expensive outcome.\nShe told me how embarrassed she was and how stupid she felt for falling for the scam. But she wanted me to share some details with you so that others don\u2019t fall for the same trap.\nLike me, she received pop-up notifications on her computer, telling her that someone was attacking her bank account and giving her a phone number to call.\nHere is a screenshot of an actual security scam that can pop up out of nowhere when you are browsing the internet.\nThe scammers on the other end were very professional. After telling her that her bank account was indeed under attack, they asked her if she knew the phone number to her bank branch. She didn\u2019t.\nThat was OK because they offered to transfer her. By now, it is obvious to you that she didn\u2019t speak to anyone from her bank. But to her, it all sounded very official. Even though she had some concerns, they had plausible answers to every question she raised.\nThey relied on pressure and timelines to keep her on the phone as she drove to her bank to withdraw funds. They gave her excuses to give if the bank tellers asked why she was withdrawing so much cash. They had reasons why people at the bank branch couldn\u2019t be trusted: The attack might be coming from inside the bank.\nIn hindsight, she sees several of the warning signs, but the people on the phone sounded very knowledgeable. She trusted them.\nShe doesn\u2019t know how she was targeted, but she was a good target because she was a recent widow. Her husband had dealt with money matters, and much of this was new to her.\nOlder people often are victimized by scammers. A recent \nAARP article\n states, \u201cLosses from scams reported by Americans over age 60 were up 11 percent [in 2023] over the year before, according to the FBI\u2019s Elder Fraud Report, with fraud criminals stealing more than $3.4 billion from older Americans in 2023.\u201d\nIf you haven\u2019t been targeted by a scam like the one I described, chances are pretty good that you have received text messages about unpaid tolls or other such scams.\nIt broke my heart to hear her story. I felt physical pain and nausea as she detailed the various steps she was directed through and the amount of money that is now gone, unlikely to ever be returned to her.\nI don\u2019t ever want to hear another story like this. Scams like this rely on urgency and fear to manipulate victims. I asked our IT Department for some tips.\nRed flags to Watch for\n: \nUnsolicited pop-ups\n: Legitimate security alerts will never appear through random browser pop-ups.\nUrgent phone calls or emails\n: Microsoft and other reputable companies do not call users about security threats.\nRequests for remote access\n: No genuine tech support will ask for access to your computer unless you initiated the request through official channels.\nPressure to make payments\n: Scammers will often insist that you transfer money immediately to \u201cprotect\u201d your assets.\nHow to Protect Yourself\n:\nClose the pop-up\n: Do not interact with it. Close the browser using Task Manager (Ctrl + Shift + Esc) if necessary.\nRun a real scan\n: Open your legitimate security software and run a scan for malware.\nNever call random numbers\n: Always verify customer support contacts directly from the company\u2019s official website.\nReport the scam\n: If you come across a fraudulent alert, report it to the Federal Trade Commission (FTC) and your local authorities.\nOther Resources\n:\nFederal Trade Commission Consumer Advice\n \nSign Up for Federal Trade Commission Consumer Alerts\nIllinois Attorney General\u2019s Office Senior Advocacy\n \nMany of us think that we could never fall for a similar scam. However, with new technologies, AI, and deep fake voice creation, these scammers have more professional tools to fool more people. We hope to provide you a few tools to fight back.\nSincerely,\nMichael\n\u00a0\nWelcome to \"The Mailbag,\" which is your opportunity to ask me about topics like our programs, other state government functions, or anything else that interests you.\nQ.\n \nYou may bleed blue and orange. In our home, we bleed maroon and gold for Loyola University of Chicago. It may be that Loyola didn't make the NCAA tournament. However, they are still playing in the NIT. There is an Illinois team to cheer for postseason. \n\u2014\nKathy W.\nA.\n I received several comments like this after \nwriting about \nthe Illini men\u2019s basketball team in the postseason. Although I love the programs that we offer in my office, it is clear that readers feel far more passionately about their sports teams. I want to congratulate all of the Illinois teams having success in the postseason, including the Loyola Ramblers men\u2019s basketball team who are in the NIT Final Four, the Illinois State Redbirds women\u2019s basketball team who are in the Fab Four of the Women\u2019s NIT, and the ISU Redbirds men\u2019s basketball team who just won the College Basketball Invitational tournament. A couple of people also pointed out success of their programs\u2019 football teams last fall.\u00a0 \nMore than a dozen Illinois colleges and universities advanced to postseason basketball tournaments this year. In addition to the teams already mentioned, others that did well in the postseason include the Bradley men\u2019s team in the NIT and the Governors State women\u2019s team in the National Association of Intercollegiate Athletics tournament. The Bradley Braves and the Governors State Jaguars each reached the quarterfinals before losing. \u00a0\nI am a proud Illinoisan and root for Illinois teams over out-of-state teams. I am proud not just of our sports teams and their success, but the colleges and universities, both public and private, that produce remarkable graduates!\nIf you have a question for \u201cThe Mailbag,\u201d please \nsend me an email\n with the subject line \u201cMailbag.\u201d I can\u2019t promise that every one of your questions will run, but we do read them all and try to respond. And let us know if we can use your name, or if you\u2019d prefer to be anonymous.\nEmail Your Questions\n\u00a0\nTreasurer Breaks Record for Investment Earnings \nIn this photo from last year, Treasurer Frerichs addresses a U.S. House of Representatives committee in our nation\u2019s capital.. \nThe State Treasurer\u2019s Office brought in a record $1.576 billion in investment earnings for the state portfolio in 2024, Illinois Treasurer Michael Frerichs recently told state senators. To put this into context, investment earnings were higher than state tax revenues collected from gaming ($1.458 billion), income from the state lottery ($886 million in FY24) and state revenue generated from cannabis sales ($490 million).\n\u201cEvery dollar we make through smart, safe investing is a dollar that does not need to be raised in taxes or cut from important priorities, like our schools, health care, and roads and bridges,\u201d Treasurer Frerichs told the Senate Appropriations Committee.\nTreasurer Frerichs also highlighted his office\u2019s success in returning missing money to people through \nI-CASH.\n When he took office, the number of I-CASH claims paid to constituents was about 60,000. That number was more than 325,000 during Fiscal Year 2024, and the cash amount totaled more than $300 million. For this fiscal year, the number of paid claims is expected to approach 400,000.\nWe may have missing money waiting for you.

I wanted to follow up on the speaking opportunity first\u2014please feel free to check out our Workplace Well-Being and Mental Health Summit agenda for May here: \nAgenda\n. If you\u2019d like to propose a senior-level leader from LCW for one of the panels, we\u2019d be happy to consider it. Please note that panel slots don\u2019t include branding, but we\u2019d still love to feature a strong voice from your team.\nYour culture-first approach to inclusion and equity\u00a0is quite impressive and is exactly what the future of workplace mental health needs. The LCW Sustainable Culture of Inclusion Model\u00a0actually complements the themes we\u2019re spotlighting this year\u2014especially around:\nReframing psychological safety and elevating it beyond policy into lived practice\nAddressing mental health through inclusive systems and cultural competence\nEmpowering leadership to build sustainable, equitable well-being strategies\nAdvancing mental health as an integral part of DEI and employee experience\nYou\u2019ll find panels like:\nRedefining Psychological Safety at Work, Sustaining the Momentum,\u00a0Building a Human-Centered Organization and more.\u00a0\nThese conversations will feature \nCPOs, Chief Wellbeing Officers, Global DEI Leaders, and forward-thinking practitioners\n from leading organizations\u2014making it a great fit for LCW\u2019s work and voice in this space, also for wide exposure.\u00a0\nNow, regarding sponsorship\u2014this summit is one of our biggest of the year and aligns greatly with LCW\u2019s culture-first, equity-driven mission. We\u2019ll have over 5,000 HR professionals, a very engaged audience, and a reach of 2 million+ through LinkedIn, newsletters, social media and community marketing.\nGiven that May is Mental Health Awareness Month, this is a great time to amplify your rebrand and show the world the work LCW is doing in inclusion and well-being. We'd love to feature your logo across all marketing and build something meaningful together only if possible.\u00a0\nGive it a thought and let us know\u2014we\u2019d be happy to chat about how we could amplify your newly rebranded identity and help you reach your next million potential clients.\nPS:\n\u00a0Let\u2019s\u00a0connect\u00a0on\u00a0\nLINKEDIN\n\u00a0if we haven\u2019t already to receive regular updates and stay in touch!\n--\n--\nSneha Sandhya Yadamari\nHacking HR\nGlobal Events & Partnerships\n\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0\nsneha@hackinghr.io\nRome, Italy, RM\n\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0\nOn Tue, Apr 1, 2025 at 8:02\u202fPM Alisa Kolodizner <\na.kolodizner@lcwmail.com\n> wrote:\nHi Laurie,\n\u00a0\nWe are in the process of rebranding and have hired a firm to support us there so moving forward would be best post In the interim, what speaking opportunities are you all working on that we could support?\n\u00a0\nThanks,\n\u00a0\nAlisa\n\u00a0\nAlisa Kolodizner \n(She/Her)\nCSMO and Managing Partner\nLCW\nEmail: \na.kolodizner@lcwmail.com\nOffice: +1.773.888.9355 [CDT]\nMobile: +1.773.430.3534\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\nWebsite\n\u00a0\n|\n\u00a0\nTwitter\n \n|\n\u00a0\nFacebook\n\u00a0\n|\n\u00a0\nLinkedIn\nView our upcoming events\n\u00a0| \nSign-up for our newsletter\n\u00a0\nFrom:\n Laurie Baggarly <\nlaurie@hackinghr.io\n> \nSent:\n Tuesday, March 25, 2025 8:44 AM\nTo:\n Alisa Kolodizner <\na.kolodizner@lcwmail.com\n>\nCc:\n Sneha Sandhya Yadamari <\nsneha@hackinghr.io\n>\nSubject:\n Re: LCW x Hacking HR\n\u00a0\nHi Alisa,\nI hope you're doing well!

I'd love to work out a calendar of sorts & have Kaitlyn put that together.\n\u00a0\nThanks!\n\u00a0\nFrom:\n\u00a0Nicole Barile <\nn.barile@lcwmail.com\n>\nSent:\n\u00a0Tuesday, February 18, 2025 12:10 PM\nTo:\n\u00a0Alisa Kolodizner <\na.kolodizner@lcwmail.com\n>; Chuck Adams <\nc.adams@lcwmail.com\n>\nSubject:\n\u00a0Speaking Opportunities\n \n\u00a0\nHi there,\n\u00a0\nI know we each have sales goals/KPIs & we are doing our best to reach those - making calls, responding to clients, tracking everything in HubSpot, etc. The LCW webinars, email campaigns, and our reach out efforts have increased traffic and interest in LCW - yay!\n\u00a0\nThe areas I think we need to step up are \nspeaking engagements & online presence.\n\u00a0\nI believe we agreed that \nAlisa\n\u00a0would try to \nspeak at 1 live event (virtual or in-person) once per month\n. I know there is something upcoming.\n\u00a0\nI believe we agreed \nChuck \nwould try to do \n1 live event per quarter\n,\n \nin addition to\n\u00a0the 1 or 2 LCW webinars\n\u00a0he is leading \neach month\n.\n\u00a0\nI would also kindly ask you both to \npost as much on LinkedIn\n\u00a0as possible. I see you both do this. It would be great if you can increase that whenever possible.\n\u00a0\nTo help in your search for where to speak, I've compiled the below orgs to help.\u00a0\n\u00a0\nAs part of our\n\u00a0sales\u00a0strategy,\n\u00a0we should be targeting \nlegal\n\u00a0orgs/associations (because they are always looking for DEI vendors & are often required to provide DEI services of some sort); \nHR \norgs/associations (because as you know, we can find corporate DEI professionals here, and as DEI teams are disbanded, HR folks need to upskill), and \nTraining & Development\n\u00a0orgs/associations (similar to HR).\n\u00a0\nHere are suggested orgs to reach out to & approach for speaking gigs:\n\u00a0\nLEGAL\n\u00a0\nhttps://www.lcld.com/event/diversity-professionals-virtual-meeting-february-2025/\nhttps://www.nalp.org/index.cfm\nhttps://alfdp.com/\n\u00a0\nHR / L&D\nhttps://hackinghrlab.io/events/people-culture-strategy-summit/\nhttps://www.chicagoshrm.org/\n\u00a0\nhttps://atdchi.org/\n\u00a0\nI've attached a list of conferences\n, but for most, we have missed the deadline for speaking.\u00a0\nOf course there are many more opportunities out there. Please research on your own.\nWe hope to hire an admin shortly who can help us with these conference efforts - apply on our behalf to speak/present, find opportunities, etc.\n\u00a0\nHelpful tips:\nAttached is a suggestion of what you can use to pitch to orgs to talk about - of course you can choose whatever you like\nPost 3 times on LinkedIn about the event you will be speaking at\n\"Come see me speak at....\"\nTag the LCW LinkedIn page & LCW employees so they can share\nTag the org hosting the event & others at that org you have spoken with\nTag others you know that might also spread the word - this can include clients, friends, orgs, etc.\n\"It's almost here - register for.....\" (tag as above)\n\"Thank you to X for having me...\" (tag as above)\nUse hashtags such as #DEI, #InclusionMatters, #BelongingAtWork #HR #HRLeadership #LearningAndDvelopment #TalentDevelopment\n\u00a0\nHappy to talk about this on our next call.\nLMK if you have any questions.\n\u00a0\nThanks!\nNicole Barile\n\u00a0\n(She/Her)\nChief Operating Officer\nLCW\n\u00a0\nWebsite\n\u00a0\n|\n\u00a0\nTwitter\n\u00a0\n|\n\u00a0\nFacebook\n\u00a0\n|\n\u00a0\nLinkedIn\nView our upcoming events\n\u00a0| \nSign-up for our newsletter",

To that end, at your renewal you will be matched with an equivalent Davis Vision plan at your current rate. Davis Vision provides comprehensive benefits with more than 152,000 access points. Look for more details in your renewal package.\u00a0\nWe recognize the important role eye health plays in overall health and well-being. That\u2019s why we want to help ensure we provide you and your employees with vision care benefits that help make eye exams, prescription glasses, contacts, and other forms of eye care accessible and affordable. \u00a0\nFor further details or if you have any questions, please contact your Guardian representative.\n\u200a\nGUARDIAN\n\u00ae\n is a registered trademark of The Guardian Life Insurance Company of America. \u00a92025 Guardian.

Could you please let us know if we answered your questions or if additional information is needed?\n\u00a0\nMedium~ small companies/ institutions list.\nWe summarized the tech company, education system, hospital system, and non-profit organizations in the Chicago/IL area. Information included name, social media, and contact information (not specific person).\nMedium \n\uff5e\n Small Companies/ Instituations in Chicago/IL area\nMedium \n\uff5e\n Small Companies/ Instituations in Chicago/IL area Tech company Medium Tech Chicago Office Employee Industry Website LinkedIn Repution.com 201-500 Online reputation management platform Website in Spothero 201-500 Parking platform Website in Sprout Social 1K-5K S...\ndocs.google.com\n\u00a0\nOther versions of \"Thank you\" email also attached.\n\u00a0\nDigital marketing strategy.\n\u00a0\nWe've attached the link in the slides to where the Cultural Intelligence Center advertised their healthcare grants. Implementing this simple link increases traffic and incentivizes businesses to utilize LCW's services. I've also noticed that the Testimonials under \"Our Impact\" and the \"Case Studies\" are all the same. We recommend adding more testimonials, anonymous if needed, and case studies to increase LCW's authenticity.\n\u00a0\nBranding\nBranding helps a brand attract new customers. It's a good practice for a brand to leverage its legacy to create a sense of trust and confidence.\nSince Google Analytics shows only one visitor, this indicates that the website is not optimized for SEO.\nOn-Page SEO: Focus on keyword optimization, content optimization, and tag optimization.\nOff-Page SEO: Prioritize local SEO (very important to target customers where we can provide services), backlinks, and linking social media to the website.\nHubSpot dashboard helps analyze traffic from different sources and campaigns.\nBranding and website optimization plan documents are attached.\n\u00a0\nGrants\nHow to apply for these grants? Answer: When you go to the link provided on the grants slide, it will have multiple tabs and one of the tabs will take you to How to apply process. For example: \nWhy did we decide to choose only these grants? Answer: This was filtered based on availability of funds. These grants offer funds upwards of $50,000. There are many small grants available in the range of $500-$2000. It takes more time and less output to go after these grants. Also, there are many federal grants which are a subset of the grants listed on the slide. They will redirect you to the same website listed on the slides.\nThank you,\u00a0\n\u00a0\nWarm regards,\nDemin, Teja, Khoa, Subhan and Jeetu\n\u00a0\nDisclaimer\nThe information contained in this communication from the sender is confidential.

    "body": "Tanenbaum Workplace Newsletter | Spring 2025\n\u200a\nWelcome to our Newest Members!\n\u200a\nTanenbaum would like to welcome its newest Members\u00a0\nASML, Corning Incorporated, and Michelin \nat the Associate Level.\nThey join a growing community of organizations committed to advancing religious diversity and inclusion in the workplace.\n\u200a\nTanenbaum at BYU Faith & Belief Case Competition\n\u200a\nLast month, we attended BYU\u2019s 3rd Annual MBA Case Competition on Faith and Belief at Work. Together with over 15 companies and students from MBA programs nationally and abroad, we encouraged solutions to address the business case for accommodating faith and belief at work.\nThe case for this year\u2019s competition, which focused on the importance and value of interfaith ERGs, allowed students to think creatively and provide business considerations around the importance of valuing faith-based communities in the workplace.\nThrough these efforts in the competition, and included amongst the persuasive arguments by the students, we resoundingly agreed that inclusion for people of all faiths and none at work remains paramount.\u00a0\u00a0\n\u200a\nStay Tuned for the 2025 Religious Diversity Leadership Summit\n\u200a\nOur Workplace team is looking forward to convening members and partners at our upcoming \n2025\n \nReligious Diversity Leadership Summit \nwith this year\u2019s theme, \nBuilding Community, Taking Action\n.\nWe are excited to continue the legacy of our Summit in engaging the ways religion shows up as part of our workplace, workforce, and marketplaces. Look out for a save-the-date in the coming weeks.\nOur Summit and Symposium offer invaluable opportunities for companies to take a proactive role in shaping the future of belonging and inclusion at work. Demonstrate your leadership in this space and consider supporting our annual events!\nIf you\u2019re interested in sponsoring our Summit and Symposium, please email Lydia Baek at \nlbaek@tanenbaum.org\n or \nselect some time here\n to meet with Workplace and the Development teams.\n\u200a\nPlan for Upcoming Holidays\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u200a\nSpring is a time of celebration and commemoration for many faith traditions.\nEid al-Fitr, the last day of the Muslim holy month of \nRamadan\n, is expected to take place on March 30th. April 13th is the start of the Theravada New Year, followed by the Sikh festival \nVaisakhi\n on April 14th.\nPassover\n \nwill begin at sundown on April 12th and end after nightfall on April 20th. This year, Western Christian Holy Week and Eastern Orthodox Christian Holy Week will coincide, with both \nEaster\n and Pascha falling on April 20th. \nThe end of April brings the Festival of Ridvan. Bahai\u2019is may suspend work on April 20th, April 28th, May 1st. May 12th is \nVesak Day\n, also known as Buddha Day, a celebration of the birth, enlightenment, and death of Siddhartha Gautama, the man who became the Buddha.\nThis season offers multiple opportunities to ensure that employees feel supported and respected in the workplace. We encourage everyone to consider the various accommodation needs that may arise and consult our \nEight Steps to the Accommodation Mindset Fact Sheet\n as a meaningful starting point.\u00a0\nWe also offer a variety of \nworkplace trainings\n to help create an environment where everyone feels respected and valued year-round.\n\u200a\nBook a Workplace Training!\n\u200a\nCreating inclusive workplaces for people of all faiths and none yields rich benefits in employee engagement and satisfaction.\nOur trainings promote an awareness of how religious beliefs and practices impact behaviors in the workplace. This increased sensitivity helps dispel biases to enhance respectful collaborations across the workforce.\u00a0\nRepresentative training options include:\nNavigating Religious Diversity in the Workplace\n \u2013 an introduction to the topic of religious diversity in the workplace that addresses the business case for faith-based inclusion efforts.\nReligious Diversity in the Workplace: Leveraging Cross-Cultural Allyship\n \u2013 highlights the intersectional nature of religion and belief and its utility in creating inclusive and respectful workplaces for employees of all identities.\nContact \nmembership@tanenbaum.org\n to book a training now!\n\u200a\nSpotlight: Competencies for Respectful Communication\n\u200a\nOne of our most frequently recommended resources, Tanenbaum\u2019s \nCompetencies for Respectful Communication\n outlines basic practices to help navigate difficult conversations at work.\nOne of these competencies is \nthe Platinum Rule\n. Many are familiar with the Golden Rule: to treat others the way you want to be treated. At Tanenbaum, we espouse the Platinum Rule: treat others the way \nthey\n want to be treated. Respect looks different across religious traditions and cultures, and the only way to know what respect looks like to another person is to ask. \nApproaching these conversations with genuine curiosity and willingness to learn can help foster a respectful working environment.\n\u200a\n\u00a0\nJoin Our April Film Screening!\nJoin us virtually or in-person for an upcoming free screening of \nAmerican Sikh\n and \nColonel Kalsi: Beyond the Call\n on April 15th, 6-8:30PM ET at the American Arbitration Association on 150 East 42nd Street. \nWe'll be joined by American Sikh creator Vishavjit Singh and Kamal S. Kalsi for a panel discussion exploring how ethical representation of religion in the media can build empathy across communities. \nRSVP here\n!\n\u200a\nAt this crucial time, you can actively fight religious hatred by supporting Tanenbaum.\nOur\u00a0real-world solutions make peace possible in the U.S. and globally.\u00a0\nDONATE TODAY!\nManage\n your preferences | \nOpt Out\n using TrueRemove\u2122\nGot this as a forward? \nSign up\n to receive our future emails.\nView this email \nonline\n.\n200 Broadway | New York, NY 10038 US\nThis email was sent to a.kolodizner@lcwmail.com.\nTo continue receiving our emails, add us to your address book.",

In partnership with top experts in academia, law and our board members, we are dedicated to equipping, educating, and empowering leaders in diversity, equity and inclusion (DEI), marketing, and business to continue to drive inclusive innovation and sustainable growth.\n\u00a0\nEvery Friday, Project FORWARD provides critical updates on executive orders (EO) and legislative developments, featuring legal interpretations from \nStacy Hawkins, Esq\n.\n, Diversity & Employment Practices Consultant and Rutgers Professor of Law, and \nJessica Golden Cortes\n, Partner, Labor + Employment Group, Davis+Gilbert LLP. We will also include the BRIDGE POV and tangible actions to consider.*\n\u00a0\nWe encourage our community to remain informed and proactive. If you have questions or insights you\u2019d like to share, please email \nprojectforward@wearebridge.com\n.\n\u00a0\nFOR PAST ISSUES OF PROJECT FORWARD WEEKLY GUIDANCE \nPLEASE VISIT HERE\n.\n\u00a0\n*These Project FORWARD updates should not be construed as legal advice or counsel. They are for educational and instructive purposes only, to aid our understanding about how best to actively continue our mission in response to this moment.\u00a0\nUPDATE ON PREVIOUSLY ISSUED EXECUTIVE ORDERS\nOVERVIEW\nFor continued reference these are the EOs targeting DEI and LGBTQ+ protections that have been issued:\nEnding Radical and Wasteful Government DEI Programs and Preferencing: Executive Order # 14151\nEnding Illegal Discrimination and Restoring Merit-Based Executive Order # 14173\nDefending Women from Gender Ideology Extremism and Restoring Biological Truth to the Federal Government: Executive Order #14168\n\u00a0\nAs of today\u2019s issue, there have been no further rulings on the above EOs. The latest update remains as published in last week\u2019s issue: On March 15, the 4th US Circuit Court of Appeals panel reinstated portions of Trump\u2019s executive orders targeting diversity, equity and inclusion (DEI) programs and suspended the injunction issued by the lower court.\n\u00a0\nBRIDGE POV\nAt this time, while the current focus has shifted, there are \nstrategic actions organizations can take to safeguard their Diversity, Equity & Inclusion practices and mitigate risk\n. Additionally, though not directly tied to these EOs, there are\n emerging signals that offer deeper insight into this administration\u2019s broader intentions\n that merit attention.\n\u00a0\nBeyond \nensuring full compliance with existing laws\n, the \nmost powerful way\n to mitigate risk is to \nbroaden your inclusion efforts across the organization \n- intentionally tying them to \nbusiness outcomes and marketplace impact.\nInclusion can be\n transformational in driving business growth\n, especially when activating historically untapped communities \nwhose buying power continues to grow in scale and influence\nConsider your \ninclusion maturity through a growth lens of how you see, serve and show up\n in the marketplace\nEEOC ISSUES LETTERS AND DEI \u201cGUIDANCE\u201d\nOVERVIEW\nWhat To Do If You Experience Discrimination Related to DEI at Work | U.S. Equal Employment Opportunity Commission\n\u00a0\nWhat You Should Know About DEI-Related Discrimination at Work | U.S. Equal Employment Opportunity Commission\n\u00a0\nLetter to Acting Chair Lucas March 18 2025\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\nAs a reminder on March 17, the Acting Commissioner of the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission, Andrea Lucas, issued letters to 20 law firms requesting detailed information of their diversity, equity and inclusion programs asserting concerns of potential Title VII violations. The letters expressly target conduct involving race- or gender-based decision-making, or activities that classify, limit, or segregate employees in ways that could potentially deny certain groups\u2014such as white or male employees\u2014equal access to employment opportunities.\u00a0\n\u00a0\nAs of March 26, 2025, the 20 law firms targeted by Acting EEOC Chair Andrea Lucas's letters regarding their DEI programs have not publicly responded to the requests. They have until April 15 to respond to the EEOC.\n\u00a0\nIn addition to the seven former EEOC Chairs and Commissioners issuing a two-page letter in response, the \nLawyers\u2019 Committee for Civil Rights Under Law released a statement condemning the actions of Lucas:\n\u201cWe condemn Acting Chair Lucas\u2019 targeting of 20 named law firms working to advance diversity, equity, and inclusion in their workplaces. Acting Chair Lucas does not have the authority alone to act or speak on behalf of the EEOC as an official body.\n Official EEOC action requires a quorum of the five-member Commission, which currently does not exist after \nTrump fired two Commissioners\n, breaking with precedent and possibly the law.\u00a0\n\u00a0\nWhile the rules allow individual EEOC Commissioners to initiate a charge of discrimination on their own initiative, all charges must be made under penalty of perjury. This prevents commissioners from initiating frivolous investigations or abusing the legal process. Lucas\u2019 letters are not charges of discrimination. \nAs such, they carry no more weight of authority than if they had been written on a cocktail napkin by any member of the public.\u201d\n\u00a0\nAnd just yesterday, more than 50 state, local and specialty bar associations,\n including the American Bar Association issued a joint statement to \u201cdefend the rule of law and reject efforts to undermine the courts and the legal profession.\u201d\n\u00a0\nLEGAL INTERPRETATION\nIt is important to note:\nThese\n \nletters do not initiate formal administrative or legal proceedings against the law firms.\n In order to initiate formal administrative or legal proceedings against any employer, the EEOC would first need to file a charge of discrimination against the employer, or to intervene in a charge of discrimination filed by an employee/complainant. Since neither of these antecedent steps appears to have occurred, \nit is questionable whether these letters constitute a legitimate exercise of the Commissioner\u2019s enforcement power under Title VII.\u00a0\n\u00a0\nFormer EEOC officials have criticized the letters\n and urged Lucas to withdraw them \nexpressing \u201cgrave concerns\u201d that this order exceeds the agency\u2019s enforcement duties under law.\u00a0\n\u00a0\nFurthermore, the letter argues that the EEOC Acting Chair has exceeded her enforcement authority under Title VII and other agency guidance, by contravening existing agency guidance endorsing DEI efforts as a means of furthering compliance with Title VII, rather than as evidence of non-compliance with Title VII. In fact, \nthe EEOC is unable to alter any existing agency guidance on this issue because the agency does not currently have the required quorum of Commissioners (a minimum of three of the five statutorily designated Commissioners must be present to constitute a quorum) that would allow it to undertake many of its regulatory functions, such as revoking, altering, or otherwise modifying agency guidance.\nCurrently, due to Trump\u2019s removal of two Democratic Commissioners shortly after his inauguration, the EEOC has only two Commissioners, which is less than a quorum.\n Although some work remains possible due to internal operating procedures that allow for routine work in the absence of a quorum (such as receiving and investigating charges of discrimination and issuing right-to-sue letters), \nmuch of the policy work of the EEOC is on hold until it has a quorum of Commissioners\n.\n\u00a0\nBRIDGE POV\nWhile these tactics are designed to create fear and uncertainty, they also offer insight into how the administration is interpreting DEI, particularly in the context\u00a0 of workplace practices. This understanding can be used to inform how organizations can continue their DEI efforts while carefully mitigating risk.\u00a0\u00a0\n\u00a0\nThe Civil Rights Act, and the legal protections it affords, remains unchanged\n - as always employers need to continue to uphold these protections when evaluating their diversity, equity and inclusion practices\nThe (acting) chair of the EEOC has limited authority - \nno member of the Commission can unilaterally change the EEOC\u2019s longstanding position on diversity, equity and inclusion\n or any other agency guidance\nLeaders should take a pragmatic approach and avoid reacting by arbitrarily eliminating their DEI practices - instead without stigma, they should apply the same rigor of evolving DEI as they do to other core\u00a0business strategies: \nidentify what\u2019s working and what isn\u2019t, strengthen its connection to business outcomes and mitigate risk.\n\u00a0\nADDITIONAL RESOURCES\nBar organizations\u2019 statement in support of the rule of law\nTHE INTERSECTION OF IMMIGRATION AND DEPORTATION WITH COMBATTING ANTISEMITISM\nOVERVIEW\nProtecting the American People Against Invasion: Executive Order # 14159\nProtecting the United States from Foreign Terrorists and Other National Security and Public Safety Threats: Executive Order # 14161\nAdditional Measures to Combat Anti-Semitism: Executive Order #13899\n\u00a0\nUpon taking office on Jan 20, 2025 \nTrump issued a number of orders related to immigration, including orders \nProtecting the American People Against Invasion \nand \nProtecting the United States from Foreign Terrorists and Other National Security and Public Safety Threats\n. Like many of the other Executive Orders, \nthe titles often obscure the true intent framing them under the guise of something more palatable or benign.\u00a0\n\u00a0\nAdditionally, within Trump\u2019s first few days in office\n he reaffirmed Executive Order 13899 to combat Antisemitism\n, issued in 2019, and directed additional measures to advance the policy.\n\u00a0\nLEGAL INTERPRETATION\nThe two above-mentioned orders relating to immigration call for a review of contracts, grants, and agreements between the federal government and \u201cnon-governmental organizations supporting or providing services, either directly or indirectly, to removable or illegal aliens.\u201d\u00a0\n\u00a0\nIn addition, the orders direct the Attorney General, Secretary of Homeland Security, and the Director of National Intelligence to \nidentify all resources that may be used to ensure that all visa applicants, including F-1 and J-1 students, are \u201cvetted and screened to the maximum degree possible.\u201d\n The administration also issued a \ndirective\n \nrepealing\n the Biden Administration\u2019s \n\u201csensitive locations\u201d policy, which prohibited raids by Immigration and Customs Enforcement or Customs and Border Protection agents at schools and other protected areas. \nGiven the Administration\u2019s focus on immigration enforcement, institutions are encouraged to \nproactively support international students in maintaining visa compliance and coordinate with campus offices and safety teams to establish a clear, unified response\u00a0plan in the event of an immigration enforcement action.\n\u00a0\nAdditionally, the America First Policy Directive to the Secretary of State executive order, which requires the State Department to align policies and programs to \u201cput American and its interests first,\u201d may impact international exchange programs and study abroad programs funded by the Department of State.\n\u00a0\nWhile \nbusiness immigration policies have largely remained untouched\n thus far, this could shift. Trump has already \nsignaled a return to strict immigration enforcement, including heightened scrutiny of foreign nationals and their employers as well as more rigorous \"vetting\" processes \nat U.S. Embassies and Consulates for foreign nationals obtaining visas abroad. Notably, his first administration attempted to overhaul the prevailing wage structure by significantly increasing employers\u2019 wage obligations - a policy stance that may well surface over the next four years.\n\u00a0\nCompounding the issue however is the \npublic rift within the Trump circle over the H-1B visa program particularly between the far-right and aligned tech allies.\n Though Trump \npreviously criticized and temporarily banned the H-1B program \nduring his first term, he has since\n reversed his stance, calling it a \u201cgreat program.\u201d \nThis flip-flop has \nfueled internal conflict, as some see the visa system as undermining American workers, while others (ironically those against diversity, equity, inclusion) view it as essential to innovation and competitiveness.\n\u00a0\nThis debate\n highlights the complex and evolving nature of the immigration policy and its potential impact on the tech industry and the broader economy.\n Concerns have been raised about \nequitable application of these and other policies suggesting that certain groups are being disproportionately targeted while others are being favored.\nThe \nExecutive Order to combat Antisemitism sits at the intersection of immigration and civil rights policies, with immigration enforcement serving as one method of its implementation.\n\u00a0\nThe Department of Justice (DOJ), in coordination with the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission (EEOC), \nhas initiated an investigation into the University of California (UC) system over allegations of a hostile work environment as a result of antisemitism against Jewish employees\n, allegedly of Title VII\u2019s prohibitions on race, national origin, and religious discrimination.\n\u00a0\nIn furtherance of that Executive Order, Trump established a multi-agency Task Force tasked with gathering information and recommending actions to combat antisemitism. As part of this broader initiative, an investigation has been launched, aligning with recent statements from EEOC Acting Chair Andrea Lucas, who identified protecting workers from religious discrimination as a key priority. This mandate was echoed in a recent EEOC press release, which highlighted the agency\u2019s collaboration with the DOJ to pursue coordinated enforcement efforts aimed at addressing antisemitism in the workplace.\n\u00a0\nReports have emerged indicating that the administration is \ntargeting college students with lawful immigrant status who publicly express support for Palestine by revoking their legal status and initiating deportation proceedings.\u00a0\n\u00a0\nAdditionally, \nrecent reports indicate that lawful individuals, including visa and green-card holders and international visitors have been detained at U.S. border crossings such as airports.\n\u00a0\nBRIDGE POV\nThe \nconvergence of stringent immigration policies, civil rights considerations and allegations of antisemitism presents multifaceted challenges for businesses. \nHeightened immigration enforcement \ncan impact workforce and workplace instability,\n particularly in industries reliant on immigrant labor and/or foreign nationals.\n\u00a0\nSimultaneously, businesses must \nnavigate the complexities of civil rights and anti-discrimination laws while maintaining the delicate balance between compliance with federal mandates and respect for religious freedoms. \nNavigating these issues requires organizations to implement comprehensive policies and consistent values that uphold legal standards while fostering an inclusive work environment.\nWork with all your employees who are \nLawful Permanent Residents (LPRs) to ensure that all their documentation, identification and other proof of status is\n in order\nCollaborate \nclosely with your immigration counsel to establish clear guidelines so that immigrant employees understand their rights to ensure a smooth re-entry\n and ensure they have direct contact in the event they need assistance. For example:\nU.S. Customs and Border Protection (CBP) officers have the authority to question individuals about their immigration status when entering or leaving the United States.\nFor lawful permanent residents (LPRs), it\u2019s advisable to carry your green card and a valid passport from your country of citizenship. While LPRs are generally required to answer questions establishing their identity and residency, refusal to respond to other inquiries may lead to delays but technically should not result in denial of entry acknowledging that everything is less predictable and uncertain at this moment.\nNon-citizen visa holders and visitors should be prepared to answer officers\u2019 questions, as refusal may lead to denial of entry.\nIt\u2019s important to note that officers may not select individuals for questioning based on religion, race, national origin, gender, ethnicity, or political beliefs. If you feel your rights are being violated during the screening process, you can request to speak with a supervisor.\nCarrying contact information for an attorney or legal services organization is also recommended\nEmployee Resource Groups (ERGs), Business Resource Groups (BRGs) or affinity groups, a vital component of a comprehensive Diversity, Equity and Inclusion strategy, p\nrovide much needed support to communities that are disproportionately affected by these policies\nWhile these groups can be created in support of a specific community,\n it\u2019s essential they remain open and accessible to all employees who wish to participate \n(establishing a code of conduct is acceptable)\nClear zero-tolerance policies against religious discrimination should be clearly documented and communicated \nto all employees. While the \nFirst Amendment protects individuals from government restrictions on speech, it does not extend to private employers\n, allowing them to regulate employee expression within the workplace. However, \nemployers must navigate the nuanced legal landscape when considering disciplinary actions related to lawful conduct during non-working hours.\n That being said, the restated EO to combat Antisemitism could insinuate more freedoms to employers around this issue.\nThis policy and other EOs could signal additional policies to be put in place around religious discrimination\n to allegedly \"protect\" Christian Nationalists against LGTBQ+ policies and practices, \nreinforcing the need of strong DEI teams to support these intentionally marginalized communities\n\u00a0\nADDITIONAL RESOURCES\nU.S. Justice Department Launches Investigation of University of California Under Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\nEEOC Acting Chair Promises to Hold Accountable Universities and Colleges for Antisemitism on Campus Workplaces\nHEADLINES TO WATCH CLOSELY\nOver the last 24hrs, there has been a call, as outlined in \nProject 2025\n, to defund NPR and PBS\nFCC threatens to block media mergers over DEI policies - like with other agencies there will likely be questions around scope and constitutionality\nCOMMUNITY EVENTS\nBRIDGE invites everyone to join for our \nmonthly Community Calls\n which take place on the last Thursday of every month, gathering DEI marketing, and business leaders committed to driving systemic change within our organizations and the industry at large.\n\u00a0\nOur next call is \nThursday, April 24th from 12-1p ET\n.\nADD CALL TO CALENDAR\n \nBRIDGE25: FORWARD\n, our annual 2 1/2 day retreat will convene close to 200 of the top DEI, Marketing & Business Leaders at the stunning Seabird Resort overlooking the beach in \nOceanside, CA, May 4-6.\nOur commitment is to deliver and experience that will be \nunapologetically indelible, determined and audacious!\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\nSpots are limited so please don't wait to sign up!\nREQUEST AN INVITE\n \n \n\u00ad \n \n\u00ad \n \n \nBRIDGE\n1276 Auto Park Way Suite D, PMB 183, Escondido, CA 92029\nThis email was sent to\u00a0a.kolodizner@lcwmail.com\nYou've received it because you've subscribed to our newsletter.\nUnsubscribe",

The easy-to-use tool is now home to over 900 forms. Here\u2019s what you need to know:\nIn with the new:\n Form Finder will soon include all dental, vision, life, disability and supplemental health forms for members, producers and employers. \nOut with the old:\n We\u2019ll remove forms in multiple places on bcbsil.com and Blue Access for Employers\nSM\n. Form Finder will be the source of truth for nearly all BCBSIL forms.\n\u00a0\nTwo Ways to Access the Form Finder Tool\nDirect Link:\n Get your \nEmployer\n forms. Bookmark the page for future use.\nNavigate:\n Go to bcbsil.com. Click the Employer tab, select Resources and choose Forms and Documents. A Form Finder button is near the top of every Forms and Documents page.\n\u00a0\nUsing the Tool\nOnce you\u2019re in Form Finder, enter keywords or select a topic from the category menu.\nClick \u201cAll Forms and Documents\u201d at the top of the category menu to display all forms.\nIn the results, forms display as line items. For details on each, click the down arrow for a description.\nExceptions:\n Forms for providers and forms related to Medicare products are not included in Form Finder. Get Provider forms \nhere\n. Medicare-related forms are accessed via the \nForms and Documents webpage\n.\nApril 2025 Worksite Wellness Webinar: The Importance of Financial Wellbeing in the Workplace\nApplies to all groups\nFinancial industry surveys show that people worry about their finances more than they do their physical health. Research confirms that financially stressed employees are less engaged during the workday and spend up to three hours a week dealing with their finances. \nGet the details\n for this webinar.\n\u00a0\nHave Your Health Plan in Hand\nAccess your health plan information anytime, anywhere with our BCBSIL App. Get your member ID card, find doctors and hospitals, see your claims, coverage and out-of-pocket spending information and more.

Additionally, the current anti-DEI political landscape has significantly impacted LCW\u2019s ability to acquire new customers. Given these factors, I believe a purchase price of $100,000 is fair. \nI am attaching an LOI to this email. \nA few key points regarding the LOI: \n1. The company\u2019s current cash position consists entirely of customer deposits. \n2. The $100,000 purchase price includes all assets, including cash. \n3.

My previous LOI still reflects my intentions. From my understanding, since this is a public UCC sale, there are no legal documents that need to be processed in advance.\nI\u2019d prefer not to involve legal counsel before the auction, as it would be costly for all parties. My understanding is that you can share the UCC sale date, time, and any relevant details so I can attend the auction. If there is anything specific that you believe requires legal involvement before the sale, please let me know.\nOnce the UCC sale takes place, my legal team will handle the closing and any related matters. They have also pointed out a few caveats that I\u2019d like to clarify:\n\u00b7\n \nIs there a specific contract under which the UCC sale must occur?\n\u00b7\n \nCan you respond to my LOI and confirm whether its terms align with what the LCW UCC sale is offering?\nLooking forward to your response.\nAndrew Rosenthal\u00a0\n\u00a0\nOn Sun, Mar 16, 2025 at 9:36\u202fPM Mr Rosenthal <\nmrrosenthal85@gmail.com\n> wrote:\nHi Steve, \nMy name is Andrew Rosenthal, and I am interested in acquiring LCW through a private UCC sale. \nFrom my understanding gained through my discussions with Alisa Kolodizner, LCW has $500,000 in customer prepayments, raising concerns about its ability to continue operations, and making any assumption of customer contracts risky. Additionally, the current anti-DEI political landscape has significantly impacted LCW\u2019s ability to acquire new customers. Given these factors, I believe a purchase price of $100,000 is fair. \nI am attaching an LOI to this email. \nA few key points regarding the LOI: \n1. The company\u2019s current cash position consists entirely of customer deposits. \n2. The $100,000 purchase price includes all assets, including cash. \n3. I am prepared to move quickly once an LOI is accepted. \nLooking forward to your thoughts. \nBest, \n\u00a0 \nAndrew Rosenthal\u00a0\nCONFIDENTIALITY NOTICE: The content of this message and any files transmitted with it is a confidential and proprietary business communication, which is solely for the use of the intended recipient(s).

My previous LOI still reflects my intentions. From my understanding, since this is a public UCC sale, there are no legal documents that need to be processed in advance.\nI\u2019d prefer not to involve legal counsel before the auction, as it would be costly for all parties. My understanding is that you can share the UCC sale date, time, and any relevant details so I can attend the auction. If there is anything specific that you believe requires legal involvement before the sale, please let me know.\nOnce the UCC sale takes place, my legal team will handle the closing and any related matters. They have also pointed out a few caveats that I\u2019d like to clarify:\nIs there a specific contract under which the UCC sale must occur?\nCan you respond to my LOI and confirm whether its terms align with what the LCW UCC sale is offering?\nLooking forward to your response.\nAndrew Rosenthal\u00a0\nOn Sun, Mar 16, 2025 at 9:36\u202fPM Mr Rosenthal <\nmrrosenthal85@gmail.com\n> wrote:\nHi Steve, \nMy name is Andrew Rosenthal, and I am interested in acquiring LCW through a private UCC sale. \nFrom my understanding gained through my discussions with Alisa Kolodizner, LCW has $500,000 in customer prepayments, raising concerns about its ability to continue operations, and making any assumption of customer contracts risky. Additionally, the current anti-DEI political landscape has significantly impacted LCW\u2019s ability to acquire new customers. Given these factors, I believe a purchase price of $100,000 is fair. \nI am attaching an LOI to this email. \nA few key points regarding the LOI: \n1. The company\u2019s current cash position consists entirely of customer deposits. \n2. The $100,000 purchase price includes all assets, including cash. \n3. I am prepared to move quickly once an LOI is accepted. \nLooking forward to your thoughts. \nBest, \n\u00a0 \nAndrew Rosenthal\u00a0\nCONFIDENTIALITY NOTICE: The content of this message and any files transmitted with it is a confidential and proprietary business communication, which is solely for the use of the intended recipient(s).

do as well in the NCAA tournament as I would\u2019ve liked.\nI\u2019m not sure I will ever be satisfied until they win a national championship. I had my heart broken in 1989 when the Flyin\u2019 Illini lost a nailbiter of a game against Michigan in the Final Four. They had already beaten Michigan twice that year.\nThe 2005 Illini team was special. An Ohio State team stopped their undefeated season in the final seconds of the final regular-season game. Illinois went on to win the Big Ten Tournament and made it to the national championship game, losing to a North Carolina team that was playing with the referees on their side.\nIf it isn\u2019t obvious by now, I grew up in Champaign County and I bleed orange and blue.\nI especially love following U of I basketball, but there is a lot to be proud of in our state\u2019s flagship University. U of I sports teams have won 23 \nnational championships\n, and the school\u2019s alumni and faculty have been awarded 28 \nPulitzer Prizes\n and 24 \nNobel Prizes\n.\nThe Flyin\u2019 Illini, one of the most talented teams Illinois has ever put on the court. \u00a0\nJohn Bardeen\n, a faculty member who died in 1991, is the only person to have won a Nobel in physics twice. He shared one Nobel for research on semiconductors and the invention of the transistor at Bell Labs, and he shared the other for the theory of superconductivity, developed at the U of I. \nThe university is the No. 5-ranked engineering school in the nation, and it\u2019s also among the country\u2019s \ntop five\n in several disciplines, including civil, materials science, computer, electrical, and environmental engineering.\nThe U of I also has one of the largest engineering programs in the U.S. Every year, it produces more engineering graduates than MIT, Stanford, and Caltech combined.\nWe produce a lot of world-class engineering graduates, but unfortunately, we also export a lot of them to the world. Many of those engineers who became entrepreneurs moved to Silicon Valley to start their companies. \nMarc Andreessen\n, the co-founder of Netscape, the first commercial web browser, started his company in Champaign, but moved to the San Francisco Bay area. YouTube co-founders \nSteve Chen and Jawed Karim\n, as well as PayPal co-founders \nMax Levchin and Luke Nosek\n, were also U of I graduates who didn\u2019t stay in Illinois. \nThis is a big part of my motivation for creating the \nIllinois Growth and Innovation Fund\n and growing it to a $1.5 billion investment pool. I knew we could earn higher returns than from our traditional investments, but we can also help keep more of our entrepreneurs here in Illinois and attract some from other states. \nWhen entrepreneurs are growing their companies and want to grow them quickly, they frequently seek venture capital funding. In the past, when they have secured funding from San Francisco Bay Area firms, those firms suggested that they had to move their operation to Silicon Valley. \nWhen those entrepreneurs secured funding from Illinois-based venture capital firms, they almost never suggested moving to California. By helping grow the number and size of Venture Capital (VC) firms in Illinois, we keep more companies here in Illinois and employ more of our taxpayers. Today, we have invested over $700 million in Illinois VC firms. This has been a catalyst in these firms investing in 598 Illinois companies. \u00a0A study and our reporting have shown that we have been responsible for creating 19,000 jobs here in Illinois. \nThough the Illini didn\u2019t do as well as I had hoped this year, I will just have to wait until next year for that national championship. In the meantime, Illinois graduates and entrepreneurs will continue racking up wins for our state.\nSincerely,\nMichael\nP.S\n. I\u2019d also like to mention two other Illinois university teams that achieved milestones in this year\u2019s NCAA March Madness basketball tournaments. The Illini women\u2019s basketball team won its first NCAA Tournament game in 25 years by beating Creighton in a first-round game. And the Southern Illinois University Edwardsville men\u2019s basketball team played for the first time ever in March Madness. Congratulations to both!\n\u00a0\nWelcome to \u201cThe Mailbag,\u201d which is your opportunity to ask me about topics like our programs, other state government functions, or anything else that interests you.\nQ.\n Could you consider putting in place a loan program ASAP for college loans? I'm scared that recent developments with the federal Department of Education will affect student loans for fall. \n\u2014 Anonymous\nA.\n Thank you for your note and thank you for reaching out regarding this issue. \nI share a similar concern around access to affordable loans to pay for college. In fact, we have launched a program directly addressing access to low-cost loans for residents attending universities and colleges here in the state. Our Student Empowerment Fund provides low-rate loans to make education more accessible for Illinois\n \nresidents who are attending a nonprofit or not-for-profit Illinois university. This program aims to alleviate student debt burdens in Illinois and make it possible for more students to pursue higher education. \nWe have recently launched a low-rate private student loan products through the Student Empowerment Fund in which we have partnered with a reputable student lender to administer and service the private student loan products.\nTo date, we have launched two products:\n \nIllinois Partnership Loan and the Illinois College Family Loan.\n These loans are for Illinois residents attending Illinois universities and have an interest rate cap of 7%. We will continue partnering with additional lenders to ensure we can offer student loan products for all Illinois residents.\nYou can read about our Student Empowerment Fund at our \nStudent Loans page\n which gives a comprehensive overview of the program. \nIf you have a question for \u201cThe Mailbag,\u201d please \nsend me an email\n with the subject line \u201cMailbag.\u201d I can\u2019t promise that every one of your questions will run, but we do read them all and try to respond.

I went ahead and made you a basic template. There are three tabs\nSummary \u2013 this will pull AR info from AR tab and deposit info from deposit tab to show the\u00a0collectability of customer AR\nAR aging \u2013 import your AR as of today and complete columns \nG:J\nType \u2013 should be one of below unless \nI am missing one\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \ni.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \nFinished: invoice for completed services that should be collected (i.e. if LCW goes out of business, the bank \nshould \nbe able to collect)\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \nii.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \nDeposit: invoice for deposit on account\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \niii.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \nMilestone: invoice for partially completed work. Also known as WIP. \nDeposit on hand \u2013 this is to note whether or not this customer has a deposit on hand. If they do, it\u2019s likely the customer won\u2019t pay for that invoice if the business goes under (I would think they\u2019d offset against their deposit if the business closes).\nCollectible \u2013 simply note if there are any issues with the receivable. If it\u2019s good AR, list it at 100%. If it\u2019s disputed, lower the collectability %. \nDeposits\n\u00a0\nIt\u2019d be helpful to get the below (with as much detail as possible)\nAR aging\nDeposit list\n\u00a0\nWe can then go through each account receivable and note:\nIs the AR for finished / completed work\nDoes the customer have any deposits on hand\n\u00a0\nIn short, you need to layout the AR and match deposits. I don\u2019t know what other assets exist for the company but to the extent there are other assets, you should seek clarity from wintrust if those should be included in this or if it is just an AR analysis. By the looks of it, it is an AR analysis. \n\u00a0\nIn terms of a call, I could do today at 5 (jumping in car for mtg at 540) or tomorrow at 500. We can go through all of this then but I at least wanted you to see the analysis so you could work on the notes we\u2019ll need\u2026\n\u00a0\nJoe \n\u00a0\nCONFIDENTIALITY NOTICE: The contents of this e-mail and any attachments are private & confidential.

These would be the pertinent portions of: \n\u00a0\na.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \nDoc. 1\u00a0 filed 5/28/23;\nb.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \nDoc 16 filed 7/31/23;\nc.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \nDoc 26 filed 10/26/23;\nd.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \nDoc 35 filed 1/26/24; and\ne.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \nDoc 36 filed 1/26/24\nThis will enable the Judge to quickly find the pertinent passages, should she wish to review them, without having to search through all of the materials.\u00a0 However, I also propose that we stipulate to what the pertinent Schedules and SoFa items are, which would probably eliminate the need for the Judge to actually review the Docketed items themselves.\u00a0 For Example, we will stipulate that Mubarak did not list his watch in his original schedules, but that he filed an amended Schedule A/B listing it and an Amended Schedule C claiming it as exempt.\u00a0 I don\u2019t see why the Judge would need to review the original and amended schedules to confirm these facts.\n4.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \nI think we should try to keep the number of Exhibits to a minimum.\u00a0 I think we can do so by stipulating as to what many of the Exhibits would show without the need to actually file the exhibits themselves.\n\u00a0\n5.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \nThe Accel Monthly Revenue Statements consist of a great many pages.\u00a0 In my proposed Exhibit 26, I put together a summary of the monthly Accel payments broken down for each of 2019, 2020 & 2021.\u00a0 If Plaintiffs will stipulate that the Monthly Summaries were tendered to them and they show the annual totals indicated on Exhibit 26, which they do, there would be no need to file the actual Monthly Revenue Statements, eliminating the need to file many pages that the Judge will never really look at.\n\u00a0\n6.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \nSimilarly, in lieu of Plaintiffs including the Marshfield LLC bank statements showing the transfers between PPI and Marshfield, LLC (your Exhibit 42), I suggest that you prepare a one page Exhibit listing each of the transfers, which we will stipulate to.\u00a0 \n\u00a0\n7.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \nI was going to file the Marshfield Station bank statements (Ex 23) that show each of the Accel Deposits going into the accounts, which is a whole lot of paper.\u00a0 I am asking that Plaintiffs Stipulate that Mubarak gave them copies of these Bank Statements, in lieu of us filing the actual Bank Statements, which the Judge is never going to look at.\n\u00a0\n8.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \nI was going to file bank statements showing when the $150K and $350K EIDL loans were deposited into the Marshfield Station Bank Accounts and when the $350K was transferred from Marshfield Station to Marshfield LLC (Ex 47 & 48).\u00a0 I think we can just stipulate as to when those funds were deposited and transferred, and once again save a lot of paper. \n\u00a0\n9.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \nI

will or may call, if we can stipulate to the matters that I believe are not in dispute, I suspect the only witnesses will be Mubarak, Syed and maybe Nasr.\n\u00a0\n14.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \nRespectfully, I do not believe you have the evidence to sustain your initial

I had a bit of a fire drill this morning. Here is what I can do on our firm\u2019s retention vis-\u00e0-vis your requests. I can drop our requested retainer from $25,000 to $15,000 and reduce my rate to $525.00 an hour, with the understanding that our firm cannot become a creditor of an insolvent client. I understand your request to go to $500.00 an hour, but $525.00 an hour is our lowest tier rate structure so I cannot create a new one. As for limiting my involvement to a finite number of hours, I frankly do not feel comfortable going into a matter having committed to something that equates to only being partially involved. We can work together to limit your instructions and my authority, but my representation of the entity renders me completely professionally and ethically responsible regardless of how much time I put into it. Last, after reviewing my notes, I don\u2019t have any new ideas since we first spoke, but a lot the creativity and advice comes after legal due diligence. \n\u00a0\nFinally, I do not believe I requested your tax return. Ariel may have so I want to point that out to you. No doubt it will help to know what is in it to collaborate with Ariel, but I am not the one who requested it. \n\u00a0\nPlease let me know if and you wish to proceed. Thank you.\n\u00a0\nAdam \n\u00a0\nFrom:\n Alisa Kolodizner <\na.kolodizner@lcwmail.com\n> \nSent:\n Wednesday, December 4, 2024 6:25 PM\nTo:\n Adam P.

    "body": "Dear Friends,\nI\u2019m thrilled to invite you to our upcoming double feature of the animated short \nAmerican Sikh\n and the documentary \nColonel Kalsi: Beyond the Call\n. The event will take place on Tuesday, April 15th, 6:00 - 8:30PM ET, at the American Arbitration Association, 150 East 42nd Street.\nRegister here to join us virtually or in person!\nThe screenings will be followed by a panel discussion with \nAmerican Sikh\n\u2019s creator, Vishavjit Singh, and the subject of \nColonel Kalsi: Beyond the Call\n, Colonel Kamaljeet Kalsi. We\u2019ll dive deeper into the films and explore how ethical representation of religion in the media can build empathy across communities. The program will also highlight Representing Religion, Tanenbaum\u2019s latest initiative connecting storytellers with resources by and about religious, spiritual, and faith communities. \nAmerican Sikh\n is an animated autobiographical short that follows Vishavjit Singh\u2019s experience with bigotry as a South Asian American and Sikh man in the U.S. and his journey to becoming a figure of acceptance through a superhero costume. The film encourages us to think about icons of popular culture and representation as pathways to connection and understanding. \nColonel Kalsi: Beyond the Call\n \ncaptures Dr. Kamal Kalsi\u2019s journey as he enlists in the U.S. military and seeks a religious exemption to uniform requirements that force him to give up practices essential to his Sikh identity. The film follows Colonel Kalsi as he\u2019s granted an exemption by the U.S. Army. Colonel Kalsi subsequently dedicates himself to ensuring that Sikhs serving in the armed services receive the same necessary recognition of their identity. \nI hope you\u2019ll join us to witness these two empowering stories. \nRSVP at the link here!\nIn anticipation,\nRev. Mark Fowler, CEO, Tanenbaum\n\u200a\nAt this crucial time, you can actively fight religious hatred by supporting Tanenbaum.

I know it\u2019s been very challenging for you personally.\u00a0\n\u00a0\nIn terms of the letter, my main comment is that experienced investors are used to seeing a P/L.

Assume your finance leader has this as the banks have probably been asking for it regularly.\u00a0\n\u00a0\nAnd then what the return on new equity would be given the new forecast.

You mention potential investor returns but don\u2019t mention how the ownership structure would change after a sale, which I would assume would have a significant impact on potential returns.\u00a0\n\u00a0\nThanks\nNick\nSent from my iPhone\nOn Mar 9, 2025, at 2:15\n\u202f\nPM, Alisa Kolodizner <\na.kolodizner@lcwmail.com\n> wrote:\n\ufeff\n \n\u00a0\n\u00a0\nAlisa Kolodizner \n(She/Her)\nCSMO and Managing Partner\nLCW\nEmail: \na.kolodizner@lcwmail.com\nOffice: +1.773.888.9355 [CDT]\nMobile: +1.773.430.3534\n\u00a0\n<image001.jpg>\n\u00a0\nWebsite\n\u00a0\n|\n\u00a0\nTwitter\n \n|\n\u00a0\nFacebook\n\u00a0\n|\n\u00a0\nLinkedIn\nView our upcoming events\n\u00a0| \nSign-up for our newsletter\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\nDisclaimer\nThe information contained in this communication from the sender is confidential.

Also known as WIP. \nDeposit on hand \u2013 this is to note whether or not this customer has a deposit on hand. If they do, it\u2019s likely the customer won\u2019t pay for that invoice if the business goes under (I would think they\u2019d offset against their deposit if the business closes).\nCollectible \u2013 simply note if there are any issues with the receivable. If it\u2019s good AR, list it at 100%. If it\u2019s disputed, lower the collectability %. \nDeposits\n\u00a0\nIt\u2019d be helpful to get the below (with as much detail as possible)\nAR aging\nDeposit list\n\u00a0\nWe can then go through each account receivable and note:\nIs the AR for finished / completed work\nDoes the customer have any deposits on hand\n\u00a0\nIn short, you need to layout the AR and match deposits. I don\u2019t know what other assets exist for the company but to the extent there are other assets, you should seek clarity from wintrust if those should be included in this or if it is just an AR analysis. By the looks of it, it is an AR analysis. \n\u00a0\nIn terms of a call, I could do today at 5 (jumping in car for mtg at 540) or tomorrow at 500.

I went ahead and made you a basic template. There are three tabs\nSummary \u2013 this will pull AR info from AR tab and deposit info from deposit tab to show the\u00a0collectability of customer AR\nAR aging \u2013 import your AR as of today and complete columns \nG:J\nType \u2013 should be one of below unless \nI am missing one\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \ni.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \nFinished: invoice for completed services that should be collected (i.e. if LCW goes out of business, the bank \nshould \nbe able to collect)\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \nii.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \nDeposit: invoice for deposit on account\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \niii.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \nMilestone: invoice for partially completed work. Also known as WIP. \nDeposit on hand \u2013 this is to note whether or not this customer has a deposit on hand. If they do, it\u2019s likely the customer won\u2019t pay for that invoice if the business goes under (I would think they\u2019d offset against their deposit if the business closes).\nCollectible \u2013 simply note if there are any issues with the receivable. If it\u2019s good AR, list it at 100%. If it\u2019s disputed, lower the collectability %. \nDeposits\n\u00a0\nIt\u2019d be helpful to get the below (with as much detail as possible)\nAR aging\nDeposit list\n\u00a0\nWe can then go through each account receivable and note:\nIs the AR for finished / completed work\nDoes the customer have any deposits on hand\n\u00a0\nIn short, you need to layout the AR and match deposits. I don\u2019t know what other assets exist for the company but to the extent there are other assets, you should seek clarity from wintrust if those should be included in this or if it is just an AR analysis. By the looks of it, it is an AR analysis. \n\u00a0\nIn terms of a call, I could do today at 5 (jumping in car for mtg at 540) or tomorrow at 500. We can go through all of this then but I at least wanted you to see the analysis so you could work on the notes we\u2019ll need\u2026\n\u00a0\nJoe \n\u00a0\nCONFIDENTIALITY NOTICE: The contents of this e-mail and any attachments are private & confidential.

I thought you said there would be no more payments from LCW. Maybe I misunderstood, but that was the takeaway that I had after our discussion. And I took that in good faith.\n\u00a0\nGiven that all of us involved on the front lines in working diligently day in and day out to save the value of LCW have begrudgingly accepted pay cuts recently, and deferred significant pay in the past, all to help the business, this is problematic to me.\n\u00a0\nWhile I understand that his contributions to you personally have value, to you, I don't see it. Andrea and RP certainly don't see it. None of his actions have contributed in attracting business, retaining business, or servicing the business we have. What I see is busy work on things that have little value to the organization as a whole. We don't need developers or programmers or anything of the sort.\n\u00a0\nYou made a personal commitment to Andrea and RP to restore their deferred pay. It is a promise I would not have made but it was made, nonetheless. And all of the qualifiers about profitability and financial health go out the window when we are able to find over $50,000 to pay someone in a personal relationship with you.\u00a0\n\u00a0\nLCW owes RP and Andrea $13,038.02. Much to my wife's chagrin, I am not even adding my deferred compensation to that total, Alisa.\u00a0\nWe should pay them. Immediately.

I thought you said there would be no more payments from LCW. Maybe I misunderstood, but that was the takeaway that I had after our discussion. And I took that in good faith.\n\u00a0\nGiven that all of us involved on the front lines in working diligently day in and day out to save the value of LCW have begrudgingly accepted pay cuts recently, and deferred significant pay in the past, all to help the business, this is problematic to me.\n\u00a0\nWhile I understand that his contributions to you personally have value, to you, I don't see it. Andrea and RP certainly don't see it. None of his actions have contributed in attracting business, retaining business, or servicing the business we have. What I see is busy work on things that have little value to the organization as a whole. We don't need developers or programmers or anything of the sort.\n\u00a0\nYou made a personal commitment to Andrea and RP to restore their deferred pay. It is a promise I would not have made but it was made, nonetheless. And all of the qualifiers about profitability and financial health go out the window when we are able to find over $50,000 to pay someone in a personal relationship with you.\u00a0\n\u00a0\nLCW owes RP and Andrea $13,038.02. Much to my wife's chagrin, I am not even adding my deferred compensation to that total, Alisa.\u00a0\nWe should pay them. Immediately. Truly.\n\u00a0\nRespectfully,\n\u00a0\nChuck\n\u00a0\nChuck Adams\n \n(He/Him)\nChief Executive Officer\nLCW\nOffice: \n+1.773.938.4285\nMobile: +1.630.373.5068\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\nWebsite\n\u00a0\n|\n\u00a0\nTwitter\n \n|\n\u00a0\nFacebook\n\u00a0\n|\n\u00a0\nLinkedIn\nView our upcoming events\n\u00a0| \nSign-up for our newsletter",

I know it\u2019s been very challenging for you personally.\u00a0\nIn terms of the letter, my main comment is that experienced investors are used to seeing a P/L. Historical and forecasted quarterly. Can show forecast if we do nothing and forecast with all of these cost out actions.

If it\u2019s good AR, list it at 100%. If it\u2019s disputed, lower the collectability %. \nDeposits\n\u00a0\nIt\u2019d be helpful to get the below (with as much detail as possible)\nAR aging\nDeposit list\n\u00a0\nWe can then go through each account receivable and note:\nIs the AR for finished / completed work\nDoes the customer have any deposits on hand\n\u00a0\nIn short, you need to layout the AR and match deposits. I don\u2019t know what other assets exist for the company but to the extent there are other assets, you should seek clarity from wintrust if those should be included in this or if it is just an AR analysis.
