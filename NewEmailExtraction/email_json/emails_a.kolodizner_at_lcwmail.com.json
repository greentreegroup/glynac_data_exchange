Also, I know that Nicole has some thoughts on updating the Products that LCW offers (listed as Solutions on the website). I also have some thoughts on updating some images on the site .

I wanted to follow up on the speaking opportunity first\u2014please feel free to check out our Workplace Well-Being and Mental Health Summit agenda for May here: \nAgenda\n. If you\u2019d like to propose a senior-level leader from LCW for one of the panels, we\u2019d be happy to consider it. Please note that panel slots don\u2019t include branding, but we\u2019d still love to feature a strong voice from your team.\nYour culture-first approach to inclusion and equity\u00a0is quite impressive and is exactly what the future of workplace mental health needs. The LCW Sustainable Culture of Inclusion Model\u00a0actually complements the themes we\u2019re spotlighting this year\u2014especially around:\nReframing psychological safety and elevating it beyond policy into lived practice\nAddressing mental health through inclusive systems and cultural competence\nEmpowering leadership to build sustainable, equitable well-being strategies\nAdvancing mental health as an integral part of DEI and employee experience\nYou\u2019ll find panels like:\nRedefining Psychological Safety at Work, Sustaining the Momentum,\u00a0Building a Human-Centered Organization and more.\u00a0\nThese conversations will feature \nCPOs, Chief Wellbeing Officers, Global DEI Leaders, and forward-thinking practitioners\n from leading organizations\u2014making it a great fit for LCW\u2019s work and voice in this space, also for wide exposure.\u00a0\nNow, regarding sponsorship\u2014this summit is one of our biggest of the year and aligns greatly with LCW\u2019s culture-first, equity-driven mission. We\u2019ll have over 5,000 HR professionals, a very engaged audience, and a reach of 2 million+ through LinkedIn, newsletters, social media and community marketing.\nGiven that May is Mental Health Awareness Month, this is a great time to amplify your rebrand and show the world the work LCW is doing in inclusion and well-being. We'd love to feature your logo across all marketing and build something meaningful together only if possible.\u00a0\nGive it a thought and let us know\u2014we\u2019d be happy to chat about how we could amplify your newly rebranded identity and help you reach your next million potential clients.\nPS:\n\u00a0Let\u2019s\u00a0connect\u00a0on\u00a0\nLINKEDIN\n\u00a0if we haven\u2019t already to receive regular updates and stay in touch!\n--\n--\nSneha Sandhya Yadamari\nHacking HR\nGlobal Events & Partnerships\n\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0\nsneha@hackinghr.io\nRome, Italy, RM\n\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0\nOn Tue, Apr 1, 2025 at 8:02\u202fPM Alisa Kolodizner <\na.kolodizner@lcwmail.com\n> wrote:\nHi Laurie,\n\u00a0\nWe are in the process of rebranding and have hired a firm to support us there so moving forward would be best post In the interim, what speaking opportunities are you all working on that we could support?\n\u00a0\nThanks,\n\u00a0\nAlisa\n\u00a0\nAlisa Kolodizner \n(She/Her)\nCSMO and Managing Partner\nLCW\nEmail: \na.kolodizner@lcwmail.com\nOffice: +1.773.888.9355 [CDT]\nMobile: +1.773.430.3534\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\nWebsite\n\u00a0\n|\n\u00a0\nTwitter\n \n|\n\u00a0\nFacebook\n\u00a0\n|\n\u00a0\nLinkedIn\nView our upcoming events\n\u00a0| \nSign-up for our newsletter\n\u00a0\nFrom:\n Laurie Baggarly <\nlaurie@hackinghr.io\n> \nSent:\n Tuesday, March 25, 2025 8:44 AM\nTo:\n Alisa Kolodizner <\na.kolodizner@lcwmail.com\n>\nCc:\n Sneha Sandhya Yadamari <\nsneha@hackinghr.io\n>\nSubject:\n Re: LCW x Hacking HR\n\u00a0\nHi Alisa,\nI hope you're doing well!

I'd love to work out a calendar of sorts & have Kaitlyn put that together.\n\u00a0\nThanks!\n\u00a0\nFrom:\n\u00a0Nicole Barile <\nn.barile@lcwmail.com\n>\nSent:\n\u00a0Tuesday, February 18, 2025 12:10 PM\nTo:\n\u00a0Alisa Kolodizner <\na.kolodizner@lcwmail.com\n>; Chuck Adams <\nc.adams@lcwmail.com\n>\nSubject:\n\u00a0Speaking Opportunities\n \n\u00a0\nHi there,\n\u00a0\nI know we each have sales goals/KPIs & we are doing our best to reach those - making calls, responding to clients, tracking everything in HubSpot, etc. The LCW webinars, email campaigns, and our reach out efforts have increased traffic and interest in LCW - yay!\n\u00a0\nThe areas I think we need to step up are \nspeaking engagements & online presence.\n\u00a0\nI believe we agreed that \nAlisa\n\u00a0would try to \nspeak at 1 live event (virtual or in-person) once per month\n. I know there is something upcoming.\n\u00a0\nI believe we agreed \nChuck \nwould try to do \n1 live event per quarter\n,\n \nin addition to\n\u00a0the 1 or 2 LCW webinars\n\u00a0he is leading \neach month\n.\n\u00a0\nI would also kindly ask you both to \npost as much on LinkedIn\n\u00a0as possible. I see you both do this. It would be great if you can increase that whenever possible.\n\u00a0\nTo help in your search for where to speak, I've compiled the below orgs to help.\u00a0\n\u00a0\nAs part of our\n\u00a0sales\u00a0strategy,\n\u00a0we should be targeting \nlegal\n\u00a0orgs/associations (because they are always looking for DEI vendors & are often required to provide DEI services of some sort); \nHR \norgs/associations (because as you know, we can find corporate DEI professionals here, and as DEI teams are disbanded, HR folks need to upskill), and \nTraining & Development\n\u00a0orgs/associations (similar to HR).\n\u00a0\nHere are suggested orgs to reach out to & approach for speaking gigs:\n\u00a0\nLEGAL\n\u00a0\nhttps://www.lcld.com/event/diversity-professionals-virtual-meeting-february-2025/\nhttps://www.nalp.org/index.cfm\nhttps://alfdp.com/\n\u00a0\nHR / L&D\nhttps://hackinghrlab.io/events/people-culture-strategy-summit/\nhttps://www.chicagoshrm.org/\n\u00a0\nhttps://atdchi.org/\n\u00a0\nI've attached a list of conferences\n, but for most, we have missed the deadline for speaking.\u00a0\nOf course there are many more opportunities out there. Please research on your own.\nWe hope to hire an admin shortly who can help us with these conference efforts - apply on our behalf to speak/present, find opportunities, etc.\n\u00a0\nHelpful tips:\nAttached is a suggestion of what you can use to pitch to orgs to talk about - of course you can choose whatever you like\nPost 3 times on LinkedIn about the event you will be speaking at\n\"Come see me speak at....\"\nTag the LCW LinkedIn page & LCW employees so they can share\nTag the org hosting the event & others at that org you have spoken with\nTag others you know that might also spread the word - this can include clients, friends, orgs, etc.\n\"It's almost here - register for.....\" (tag as above)\n\"Thank you to X for having me...\" (tag as above)\nUse hashtags such as #DEI, #InclusionMatters, #BelongingAtWork #HR #HRLeadership #LearningAndDvelopment #TalentDevelopment\n\u00a0\nHappy to talk about this on our next call.\nLMK if you have any questions.\n\u00a0\nThanks!\nNicole Barile\n\u00a0\n(She/Her)\nChief Operating Officer\nLCW\n\u00a0\nWebsite\n\u00a0\n|\n\u00a0\nTwitter\n\u00a0\n|\n\u00a0\nFacebook\n\u00a0\n|\n\u00a0\nLinkedIn\nView our upcoming events\n\u00a0| \nSign-up for our newsletter",

To that end, at your renewal you will be matched with an equivalent Davis Vision plan at your current rate. Davis Vision provides comprehensive benefits with more than 152,000 access points. Look for more details in your renewal package.\u00a0\nWe recognize the important role eye health plays in overall health and well-being. That\u2019s why we want to help ensure we provide you and your employees with vision care benefits that help make eye exams, prescription glasses, contacts, and other forms of eye care accessible and affordable. \u00a0\nFor further details or if you have any questions, please contact your Guardian representative.\n\u200a\nGUARDIAN\n\u00ae\n is a registered trademark of The Guardian Life Insurance Company of America. \u00a92025 Guardian.

Could you please let us know if we answered your questions or if additional information is needed?\n\u00a0\nMedium~ small companies/ institutions list.\nWe summarized the tech company, education system, hospital system, and non-profit organizations in the Chicago/IL area. Information included name, social media, and contact information (not specific person).\nMedium \n\uff5e\n Small Companies/ Instituations in Chicago/IL area\nMedium \n\uff5e\n Small Companies/ Instituations in Chicago/IL area Tech company Medium Tech Chicago Office Employee Industry Website LinkedIn Repution.com 201-500 Online reputation management platform Website in Spothero 201-500 Parking platform Website in Sprout Social 1K-5K S...\ndocs.google.com\n\u00a0\nOther versions of \"Thank you\" email also attached.\n\u00a0\nDigital marketing strategy.\n\u00a0\nWe've attached the link in the slides to where the Cultural Intelligence Center advertised their healthcare grants. Implementing this simple link increases traffic and incentivizes businesses to utilize LCW's services. I've also noticed that the Testimonials under \"Our Impact\" and the \"Case Studies\" are all the same. We recommend adding more testimonials, anonymous if needed, and case studies to increase LCW's authenticity.\n\u00a0\nBranding\nBranding helps a brand attract new customers. It's a good practice for a brand to leverage its legacy to create a sense of trust and confidence.\nSince Google Analytics shows only one visitor, this indicates that the website is not optimized for SEO.\nOn-Page SEO: Focus on keyword optimization, content optimization, and tag optimization.\nOff-Page SEO: Prioritize local SEO (very important to target customers where we can provide services), backlinks, and linking social media to the website.\nHubSpot dashboard helps analyze traffic from different sources and campaigns.\nBranding and website optimization plan documents are attached.\n\u00a0\nGrants\nHow to apply for these grants? Answer: When you go to the link provided on the grants slide, it will have multiple tabs and one of the tabs will take you to How to apply process. For example: \nWhy did we decide to choose only these grants? Answer: This was filtered based on availability of funds. These grants offer funds upwards of $50,000. There are many small grants available in the range of $500-$2000. It takes more time and less output to go after these grants. Also, there are many federal grants which are a subset of the grants listed on the slide. They will redirect you to the same website listed on the slides.\nThank you,\u00a0\n\u00a0\nWarm regards,\nDemin, Teja, Khoa, Subhan and Jeetu\n\u00a0\nDisclaimer\nThe information contained in this communication from the sender is confidential.

    "body": "Tanenbaum Workplace Newsletter | Spring 2025\n\u200a\nWelcome to our Newest Members!\n\u200a\nTanenbaum would like to welcome its newest Members\u00a0\nASML, Corning Incorporated, and Michelin \nat the Associate Level.\nThey join a growing community of organizations committed to advancing religious diversity and inclusion in the workplace.\n\u200a\nTanenbaum at BYU Faith & Belief Case Competition\n\u200a\nLast month, we attended BYU\u2019s 3rd Annual MBA Case Competition on Faith and Belief at Work. Together with over 15 companies and students from MBA programs nationally and abroad, we encouraged solutions to address the business case for accommodating faith and belief at work.\nThe case for this year\u2019s competition, which focused on the importance and value of interfaith ERGs, allowed students to think creatively and provide business considerations around the importance of valuing faith-based communities in the workplace.\nThrough these efforts in the competition, and included amongst the persuasive arguments by the students, we resoundingly agreed that inclusion for people of all faiths and none at work remains paramount.\u00a0\u00a0\n\u200a\nStay Tuned for the 2025 Religious Diversity Leadership Summit\n\u200a\nOur Workplace team is looking forward to convening members and partners at our upcoming \n2025\n \nReligious Diversity Leadership Summit \nwith this year\u2019s theme, \nBuilding Community, Taking Action\n.\nWe are excited to continue the legacy of our Summit in engaging the ways religion shows up as part of our workplace, workforce, and marketplaces. Look out for a save-the-date in the coming weeks.\nOur Summit and Symposium offer invaluable opportunities for companies to take a proactive role in shaping the future of belonging and inclusion at work. Demonstrate your leadership in this space and consider supporting our annual events!\nIf you\u2019re interested in sponsoring our Summit and Symposium, please email Lydia Baek at \nlbaek@tanenbaum.org\n or \nselect some time here\n to meet with Workplace and the Development teams.\n\u200a\nPlan for Upcoming Holidays\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u200a\nSpring is a time of celebration and commemoration for many faith traditions.\nEid al-Fitr, the last day of the Muslim holy month of \nRamadan\n, is expected to take place on March 30th. April 13th is the start of the Theravada New Year, followed by the Sikh festival \nVaisakhi\n on April 14th.\nPassover\n \nwill begin at sundown on April 12th and end after nightfall on April 20th. This year, Western Christian Holy Week and Eastern Orthodox Christian Holy Week will coincide, with both \nEaster\n and Pascha falling on April 20th. \nThe end of April brings the Festival of Ridvan. Bahai\u2019is may suspend work on April 20th, April 28th, May 1st. May 12th is \nVesak Day\n, also known as Buddha Day, a celebration of the birth, enlightenment, and death of Siddhartha Gautama, the man who became the Buddha.\nThis season offers multiple opportunities to ensure that employees feel supported and respected in the workplace. We encourage everyone to consider the various accommodation needs that may arise and consult our \nEight Steps to the Accommodation Mindset Fact Sheet\n as a meaningful starting point.\u00a0\nWe also offer a variety of \nworkplace trainings\n to help create an environment where everyone feels respected and valued year-round.\n\u200a\nBook a Workplace Training!\n\u200a\nCreating inclusive workplaces for people of all faiths and none yields rich benefits in employee engagement and satisfaction.\nOur trainings promote an awareness of how religious beliefs and practices impact behaviors in the workplace. This increased sensitivity helps dispel biases to enhance respectful collaborations across the workforce.\u00a0\nRepresentative training options include:\nNavigating Religious Diversity in the Workplace\n \u2013 an introduction to the topic of religious diversity in the workplace that addresses the business case for faith-based inclusion efforts.\nReligious Diversity in the Workplace: Leveraging Cross-Cultural Allyship\n \u2013 highlights the intersectional nature of religion and belief and its utility in creating inclusive and respectful workplaces for employees of all identities.\nContact \nmembership@tanenbaum.org\n to book a training now!\n\u200a\nSpotlight: Competencies for Respectful Communication\n\u200a\nOne of our most frequently recommended resources, Tanenbaum\u2019s \nCompetencies for Respectful Communication\n outlines basic practices to help navigate difficult conversations at work.\nOne of these competencies is \nthe Platinum Rule\n. Many are familiar with the Golden Rule: to treat others the way you want to be treated. At Tanenbaum, we espouse the Platinum Rule: treat others the way \nthey\n want to be treated. Respect looks different across religious traditions and cultures, and the only way to know what respect looks like to another person is to ask. \nApproaching these conversations with genuine curiosity and willingness to learn can help foster a respectful working environment.\n\u200a\n\u00a0\nJoin Our April Film Screening!\nJoin us virtually or in-person for an upcoming free screening of \nAmerican Sikh\n and \nColonel Kalsi: Beyond the Call\n on April 15th, 6-8:30PM ET at the American Arbitration Association on 150 East 42nd Street. \nWe'll be joined by American Sikh creator Vishavjit Singh and Kamal S. Kalsi for a panel discussion exploring how ethical representation of religion in the media can build empathy across communities. \nRSVP here\n!\n\u200a\nAt this crucial time, you can actively fight religious hatred by supporting Tanenbaum.\nOur\u00a0real-world solutions make peace possible in the U.S. and globally.\u00a0\nDONATE TODAY!\nManage\n your preferences | \nOpt Out\n using TrueRemove\u2122\nGot this as a forward? \nSign up\n to receive our future emails.\nView this email \nonline\n.\n200 Broadway | New York, NY 10038 US\nThis email was sent to a.kolodizner@lcwmail.com.\nTo continue receiving our emails, add us to your address book.",

In partnership with top experts in academia, law and our board members, we are dedicated to equipping, educating, and empowering leaders in diversity, equity and inclusion (DEI), marketing, and business to continue to drive inclusive innovation and sustainable growth.\n\u00a0\nEvery Friday, Project FORWARD provides critical updates on executive orders (EO) and legislative developments, featuring legal interpretations from \nStacy Hawkins, Esq\n.\n, Diversity & Employment Practices Consultant and Rutgers Professor of Law, and \nJessica Golden Cortes\n, Partner, Labor + Employment Group, Davis+Gilbert LLP. We will also include the BRIDGE POV and tangible actions to consider.*\n\u00a0\nWe encourage our community to remain informed and proactive. If you have questions or insights you\u2019d like to share, please email \nprojectforward@wearebridge.com\n.\n\u00a0\nFOR PAST ISSUES OF PROJECT FORWARD WEEKLY GUIDANCE \nPLEASE VISIT HERE\n.\n\u00a0\n*These Project FORWARD updates should not be construed as legal advice or counsel. They are for educational and instructive purposes only, to aid our understanding about how best to actively continue our mission in response to this moment.\u00a0\nUPDATE ON PREVIOUSLY ISSUED EXECUTIVE ORDERS\nOVERVIEW\nFor continued reference these are the EOs targeting DEI and LGBTQ+ protections that have been issued:\nEnding Radical and Wasteful Government DEI Programs and Preferencing: Executive Order # 14151\nEnding Illegal Discrimination and Restoring Merit-Based Executive Order # 14173\nDefending Women from Gender Ideology Extremism and Restoring Biological Truth to the Federal Government: Executive Order #14168\n\u00a0\nAs of today\u2019s issue, there have been no further rulings on the above EOs. The latest update remains as published in last week\u2019s issue: On March 15, the 4th US Circuit Court of Appeals panel reinstated portions of Trump\u2019s executive orders targeting diversity, equity and inclusion (DEI) programs and suspended the injunction issued by the lower court.\n\u00a0\nBRIDGE POV\nAt this time, while the current focus has shifted, there are \nstrategic actions organizations can take to safeguard their Diversity, Equity & Inclusion practices and mitigate risk\n. Additionally, though not directly tied to these EOs, there are\n emerging signals that offer deeper insight into this administration\u2019s broader intentions\n that merit attention.\n\u00a0\nBeyond \nensuring full compliance with existing laws\n, the \nmost powerful way\n to mitigate risk is to \nbroaden your inclusion efforts across the organization \n- intentionally tying them to \nbusiness outcomes and marketplace impact.\nInclusion can be\n transformational in driving business growth\n, especially when activating historically untapped communities \nwhose buying power continues to grow in scale and influence\nConsider your \ninclusion maturity through a growth lens of how you see, serve and show up\n in the marketplace\nEEOC ISSUES LETTERS AND DEI \u201cGUIDANCE\u201d\nOVERVIEW\nWhat To Do If You Experience Discrimination Related to DEI at Work | U.S. Equal Employment Opportunity Commission\n\u00a0\nWhat You Should Know About DEI-Related Discrimination at Work | U.S. Equal Employment Opportunity Commission\n\u00a0\nLetter to Acting Chair Lucas March 18 2025\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\nAs a reminder on March 17, the Acting Commissioner of the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission, Andrea Lucas, issued letters to 20 law firms requesting detailed information of their diversity, equity and inclusion programs asserting concerns of potential Title VII violations. The letters expressly target conduct involving race- or gender-based decision-making, or activities that classify, limit, or segregate employees in ways that could potentially deny certain groups\u2014such as white or male employees\u2014equal access to employment opportunities.\u00a0\n\u00a0\nAs of March 26, 2025, the 20 law firms targeted by Acting EEOC Chair Andrea Lucas's letters regarding their DEI programs have not publicly responded to the requests. They have until April 15 to respond to the EEOC.\n\u00a0\nIn addition to the seven former EEOC Chairs and Commissioners issuing a two-page letter in response, the \nLawyers\u2019 Committee for Civil Rights Under Law released a statement condemning the actions of Lucas:\n\u201cWe condemn Acting Chair Lucas\u2019 targeting of 20 named law firms working to advance diversity, equity, and inclusion in their workplaces. Acting Chair Lucas does not have the authority alone to act or speak on behalf of the EEOC as an official body.\n Official EEOC action requires a quorum of the five-member Commission, which currently does not exist after \nTrump fired two Commissioners\n, breaking with precedent and possibly the law.\u00a0\n\u00a0\nWhile the rules allow individual EEOC Commissioners to initiate a charge of discrimination on their own initiative, all charges must be made under penalty of perjury. This prevents commissioners from initiating frivolous investigations or abusing the legal process. Lucas\u2019 letters are not charges of discrimination. \nAs such, they carry no more weight of authority than if they had been written on a cocktail napkin by any member of the public.\u201d\n\u00a0\nAnd just yesterday, more than 50 state, local and specialty bar associations,\n including the American Bar Association issued a joint statement to \u201cdefend the rule of law and reject efforts to undermine the courts and the legal profession.\u201d\n\u00a0\nLEGAL INTERPRETATION\nIt is important to note:\nThese\n \nletters do not initiate formal administrative or legal proceedings against the law firms.\n In order to initiate formal administrative or legal proceedings against any employer, the EEOC would first need to file a charge of discrimination against the employer, or to intervene in a charge of discrimination filed by an employee/complainant. Since neither of these antecedent steps appears to have occurred, \nit is questionable whether these letters constitute a legitimate exercise of the Commissioner\u2019s enforcement power under Title VII.\u00a0\n\u00a0\nFormer EEOC officials have criticized the letters\n and urged Lucas to withdraw them \nexpressing \u201cgrave concerns\u201d that this order exceeds the agency\u2019s enforcement duties under law.\u00a0\n\u00a0\nFurthermore, the letter argues that the EEOC Acting Chair has exceeded her enforcement authority under Title VII and other agency guidance, by contravening existing agency guidance endorsing DEI efforts as a means of furthering compliance with Title VII, rather than as evidence of non-compliance with Title VII. In fact, \nthe EEOC is unable to alter any existing agency guidance on this issue because the agency does not currently have the required quorum of Commissioners (a minimum of three of the five statutorily designated Commissioners must be present to constitute a quorum) that would allow it to undertake many of its regulatory functions, such as revoking, altering, or otherwise modifying agency guidance.\nCurrently, due to Trump\u2019s removal of two Democratic Commissioners shortly after his inauguration, the EEOC has only two Commissioners, which is less than a quorum.\n Although some work remains possible due to internal operating procedures that allow for routine work in the absence of a quorum (such as receiving and investigating charges of discrimination and issuing right-to-sue letters), \nmuch of the policy work of the EEOC is on hold until it has a quorum of Commissioners\n.\n\u00a0\nBRIDGE POV\nWhile these tactics are designed to create fear and uncertainty, they also offer insight into how the administration is interpreting DEI, particularly in the context\u00a0 of workplace practices. This understanding can be used to inform how organizations can continue their DEI efforts while carefully mitigating risk.\u00a0\u00a0\n\u00a0\nThe Civil Rights Act, and the legal protections it affords, remains unchanged\n - as always employers need to continue to uphold these protections when evaluating their diversity, equity and inclusion practices\nThe (acting) chair of the EEOC has limited authority - \nno member of the Commission can unilaterally change the EEOC\u2019s longstanding position on diversity, equity and inclusion\n or any other agency guidance\nLeaders should take a pragmatic approach and avoid reacting by arbitrarily eliminating their DEI practices - instead without stigma, they should apply the same rigor of evolving DEI as they do to other core\u00a0business strategies: \nidentify what\u2019s working and what isn\u2019t, strengthen its connection to business outcomes and mitigate risk.\n\u00a0\nADDITIONAL RESOURCES\nBar organizations\u2019 statement in support of the rule of law\nTHE INTERSECTION OF IMMIGRATION AND DEPORTATION WITH COMBATTING ANTISEMITISM\nOVERVIEW\nProtecting the American People Against Invasion: Executive Order # 14159\nProtecting the United States from Foreign Terrorists and Other National Security and Public Safety Threats: Executive Order # 14161\nAdditional Measures to Combat Anti-Semitism: Executive Order #13899\n\u00a0\nUpon taking office on Jan 20, 2025 \nTrump issued a number of orders related to immigration, including orders \nProtecting the American People Against Invasion \nand \nProtecting the United States from Foreign Terrorists and Other National Security and Public Safety Threats\n. Like many of the other Executive Orders, \nthe titles often obscure the true intent framing them under the guise of something more palatable or benign.\u00a0\n\u00a0\nAdditionally, within Trump\u2019s first few days in office\n he reaffirmed Executive Order 13899 to combat Antisemitism\n, issued in 2019, and directed additional measures to advance the policy.\n\u00a0\nLEGAL INTERPRETATION\nThe two above-mentioned orders relating to immigration call for a review of contracts, grants, and agreements between the federal government and \u201cnon-governmental organizations supporting or providing services, either directly or indirectly, to removable or illegal aliens.\u201d\u00a0\n\u00a0\nIn addition, the orders direct the Attorney General, Secretary of Homeland Security, and the Director of National Intelligence to \nidentify all resources that may be used to ensure that all visa applicants, including F-1 and J-1 students, are \u201cvetted and screened to the maximum degree possible.\u201d\n The administration also issued a \ndirective\n \nrepealing\n the Biden Administration\u2019s \n\u201csensitive locations\u201d policy, which prohibited raids by Immigration and Customs Enforcement or Customs and Border Protection agents at schools and other protected areas. \nGiven the Administration\u2019s focus on immigration enforcement, institutions are encouraged to \nproactively support international students in maintaining visa compliance and coordinate with campus offices and safety teams to establish a clear, unified response\u00a0plan in the event of an immigration enforcement action.\n\u00a0\nAdditionally, the America First Policy Directive to the Secretary of State executive order, which requires the State Department to align policies and programs to \u201cput American and its interests first,\u201d may impact international exchange programs and study abroad programs funded by the Department of State.\n\u00a0\nWhile \nbusiness immigration policies have largely remained untouched\n thus far, this could shift. Trump has already \nsignaled a return to strict immigration enforcement, including heightened scrutiny of foreign nationals and their employers as well as more rigorous \"vetting\" processes \nat U.S. Embassies and Consulates for foreign nationals obtaining visas abroad. Notably, his first administration attempted to overhaul the prevailing wage structure by significantly increasing employers\u2019 wage obligations - a policy stance that may well surface over the next four years.\n\u00a0\nCompounding the issue however is the \npublic rift within the Trump circle over the H-1B visa program particularly between the far-right and aligned tech allies.\n Though Trump \npreviously criticized and temporarily banned the H-1B program \nduring his first term, he has since\n reversed his stance, calling it a \u201cgreat program.\u201d \nThis flip-flop has \nfueled internal conflict, as some see the visa system as undermining American workers, while others (ironically those against diversity, equity, inclusion) view it as essential to innovation and competitiveness.\n\u00a0\nThis debate\n highlights the complex and evolving nature of the immigration policy and its potential impact on the tech industry and the broader economy.\n Concerns have been raised about \nequitable application of these and other policies suggesting that certain groups are being disproportionately targeted while others are being favored.\nThe \nExecutive Order to combat Antisemitism sits at the intersection of immigration and civil rights policies, with immigration enforcement serving as one method of its implementation.\n\u00a0\nThe Department of Justice (DOJ), in coordination with the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission (EEOC), \nhas initiated an investigation into the University of California (UC) system over allegations of a hostile work environment as a result of antisemitism against Jewish employees\n, allegedly of Title VII\u2019s prohibitions on race, national origin, and religious discrimination.\n\u00a0\nIn furtherance of that Executive Order, Trump established a multi-agency Task Force tasked with gathering information and recommending actions to combat antisemitism. As part of this broader initiative, an investigation has been launched, aligning with recent statements from EEOC Acting Chair Andrea Lucas, who identified protecting workers from religious discrimination as a key priority. This mandate was echoed in a recent EEOC press release, which highlighted the agency\u2019s collaboration with the DOJ to pursue coordinated enforcement efforts aimed at addressing antisemitism in the workplace.\n\u00a0\nReports have emerged indicating that the administration is \ntargeting college students with lawful immigrant status who publicly express support for Palestine by revoking their legal status and initiating deportation proceedings.\u00a0\n\u00a0\nAdditionally, \nrecent reports indicate that lawful individuals, including visa and green-card holders and international visitors have been detained at U.S. border crossings such as airports.\n\u00a0\nBRIDGE POV\nThe \nconvergence of stringent immigration policies, civil rights considerations and allegations of antisemitism presents multifaceted challenges for businesses. \nHeightened immigration enforcement \ncan impact workforce and workplace instability,\n particularly in industries reliant on immigrant labor and/or foreign nationals.\n\u00a0\nSimultaneously, businesses must \nnavigate the complexities of civil rights and anti-discrimination laws while maintaining the delicate balance between compliance with federal mandates and respect for religious freedoms. \nNavigating these issues requires organizations to implement comprehensive policies and consistent values that uphold legal standards while fostering an inclusive work environment.\nWork with all your employees who are \nLawful Permanent Residents (LPRs) to ensure that all their documentation, identification and other proof of status is\n in order\nCollaborate \nclosely with your immigration counsel to establish clear guidelines so that immigrant employees understand their rights to ensure a smooth re-entry\n and ensure they have direct contact in the event they need assistance. For example:\nU.S. Customs and Border Protection (CBP) officers have the authority to question individuals about their immigration status when entering or leaving the United States.\nFor lawful permanent residents (LPRs), it\u2019s advisable to carry your green card and a valid passport from your country of citizenship. While LPRs are generally required to answer questions establishing their identity and residency, refusal to respond to other inquiries may lead to delays but technically should not result in denial of entry acknowledging that everything is less predictable and uncertain at this moment.\nNon-citizen visa holders and visitors should be prepared to answer officers\u2019 questions, as refusal may lead to denial of entry.\nIt\u2019s important to note that officers may not select individuals for questioning based on religion, race, national origin, gender, ethnicity, or political beliefs. If you feel your rights are being violated during the screening process, you can request to speak with a supervisor.\nCarrying contact information for an attorney or legal services organization is also recommended\nEmployee Resource Groups (ERGs), Business Resource Groups (BRGs) or affinity groups, a vital component of a comprehensive Diversity, Equity and Inclusion strategy, p\nrovide much needed support to communities that are disproportionately affected by these policies\nWhile these groups can be created in support of a specific community,\n it\u2019s essential they remain open and accessible to all employees who wish to participate \n(establishing a code of conduct is acceptable)\nClear zero-tolerance policies against religious discrimination should be clearly documented and communicated \nto all employees. While the \nFirst Amendment protects individuals from government restrictions on speech, it does not extend to private employers\n, allowing them to regulate employee expression within the workplace. However, \nemployers must navigate the nuanced legal landscape when considering disciplinary actions related to lawful conduct during non-working hours.\n That being said, the restated EO to combat Antisemitism could insinuate more freedoms to employers around this issue.\nThis policy and other EOs could signal additional policies to be put in place around religious discrimination\n to allegedly \"protect\" Christian Nationalists against LGTBQ+ policies and practices, \nreinforcing the need of strong DEI teams to support these intentionally marginalized communities\n\u00a0\nADDITIONAL RESOURCES\nU.S. Justice Department Launches Investigation of University of California Under Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\nEEOC Acting Chair Promises to Hold Accountable Universities and Colleges for Antisemitism on Campus Workplaces\nHEADLINES TO WATCH CLOSELY\nOver the last 24hrs, there has been a call, as outlined in \nProject 2025\n, to defund NPR and PBS\nFCC threatens to block media mergers over DEI policies - like with other agencies there will likely be questions around scope and constitutionality\nCOMMUNITY EVENTS\nBRIDGE invites everyone to join for our \nmonthly Community Calls\n which take place on the last Thursday of every month, gathering DEI marketing, and business leaders committed to driving systemic change within our organizations and the industry at large.\n\u00a0\nOur next call is \nThursday, April 24th from 12-1p ET\n.\nADD CALL TO CALENDAR\n \nBRIDGE25: FORWARD\n, our annual 2 1/2 day retreat will convene close to 200 of the top DEI, Marketing & Business Leaders at the stunning Seabird Resort overlooking the beach in \nOceanside, CA, May 4-6.\nOur commitment is to deliver and experience that will be \nunapologetically indelible, determined and audacious!\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\nSpots are limited so please don't wait to sign up!\nREQUEST AN INVITE\n \n \n\u00ad \n \n\u00ad \n \n \nBRIDGE\n1276 Auto Park Way Suite D, PMB 183, Escondido, CA 92029\nThis email was sent to\u00a0a.kolodizner@lcwmail.com\nYou've received it because you've subscribed to our newsletter.\nUnsubscribe",

The easy-to-use tool is now home to over 900 forms. Here\u2019s what you need to know:\nIn with the new:\n Form Finder will soon include all dental, vision, life, disability and supplemental health forms for members, producers and employers. \nOut with the old:\n We\u2019ll remove forms in multiple places on bcbsil.com and Blue Access for Employers\nSM\n. Form Finder will be the source of truth for nearly all BCBSIL forms.\n\u00a0\nTwo Ways to Access the Form Finder Tool\nDirect Link:\n Get your \nEmployer\n forms. Bookmark the page for future use.\nNavigate:\n Go to bcbsil.com. Click the Employer tab, select Resources and choose Forms and Documents. A Form Finder button is near the top of every Forms and Documents page.\n\u00a0\nUsing the Tool\nOnce you\u2019re in Form Finder, enter keywords or select a topic from the category menu.\nClick \u201cAll Forms and Documents\u201d at the top of the category menu to display all forms.\nIn the results, forms display as line items. For details on each, click the down arrow for a description.\nExceptions:\n Forms for providers and forms related to Medicare products are not included in Form Finder. Get Provider forms \nhere\n. Medicare-related forms are accessed via the \nForms and Documents webpage\n.\nApril 2025 Worksite Wellness Webinar: The Importance of Financial Wellbeing in the Workplace\nApplies to all groups\nFinancial industry surveys show that people worry about their finances more than they do their physical health. Research confirms that financially stressed employees are less engaged during the workday and spend up to three hours a week dealing with their finances. \nGet the details\n for this webinar.\n\u00a0\nHave Your Health Plan in Hand\nAccess your health plan information anytime, anywhere with our BCBSIL App. Get your member ID card, find doctors and hospitals, see your claims, coverage and out-of-pocket spending information and more.
