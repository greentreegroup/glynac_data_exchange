And input from different teams.\u00a0\nYou run into bottlenecks when information sits with one person. Painful manual updates.\nHowever, revenue forecasting is key to understanding potential problem areas.\u00a0\n\u00a0\nProblem areas such as the ones highlighted in the revenue forecast below. April needs additional resources to support a big month, and June needs a sales push.\nForeseeing this allows you to take action and plan proactively.\n \nA reliable revenue forecast combines data from your won contracts, your sales pipeline and predictions based on your previous performance:\nWon contracts\n - these are your existing projects. It should be recognized in your forecast when you expect to deliver the work. Provides accurate but short-term data for your forecast.\nSales pipeline \n- this includes proposals you have sent to your prospects that you are expecting to win. This amount should be distributed across the project span. Provides less accurate mid-term data for your forecast.\nProjections based on previous performance\n - are based on results from the past and market trends. Since this requires some guesswork, it\u2019s less reliable but it does give you a long-term view.\nEach of these data sources forecasts revenue over different time spans - shown below:\n \nWhat\u2019s next?\nYou\u2019ve seen what data is needed to build a solid revenue forecast.\u00a0\nNow here\u2019s the good news.\u00a0\nScoro brings together your ongoing projects and sales pipeline into one report.\nAutomatically generating your revenue forecast for you.\nYour own company-wide, real-time report, allowing you to plan ahead.\n\u00a0\nHere it is:\n \nFor a detailed guide on how Scoro\u2019s revenue report works see \nhere\n.\nIn Case You Missed It\nSee how easy it is to generate your revenue forecast with the demonstration below:\nAutomating Revenue Forecasting with Scoro\nUnderstand the importance of forecasting, its challenges and a useful framework to follow in this webinar:\nRevenue Forecasting for a Profitable Year Ahead\nTim Downs, director at Aberfield Communications, shares how he motivated his team when putting processes and policies in place in this webinar:\nAct Like a Small Agency, Think Like a Big One\n\ud83d\udccd Upcomin\ng\n Webinar\n \nIn a competitive world, how do you stand out?

    "body": "This month we're diving into why RallyBright surpasses more traditional methods for benchmarking team performance.\n \nHello, Melonya \u2014\n\u00a0\nIn this month's Resilient Teams newsletter, we're sharing our latest RallyBright blog post tackling why traditional employee surveys fall short, and how our platform is better-suited for helping leaders build exceptional teams. We also have a recap of RallyBright's presentation during the recent Women in Tech 2023 event in Boston.\n\u00a0\nFinally, we're unveiling RallyBright's brand new Leadership Experience demo! Leaders are welcome to use our lightweight tool to quickly assess and benchmark their teams' performance.\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u2013Your friends at RallyBright\nLEARNING\n \nRallyBright vs. Traditional Employee Survey Software\nWhile employee surveys are essential, traditional tools and methods often fall short of capturing accurate employee sentiment and engagement. This is where RallyBright comes in--we stand out from other typical types of employee survey software and can make a tangible difference in how your team performs.\u00a0\n\u00a0\nRead on \nhere\n for everything you need to know about employee surveys, why they often fall short, and how RallyBright can positively impact your company.\n \nUse RallyBright to Discover How Adaptable Your Teams Are at Work\nWhen teams are adaptable, they share a strong outside-in focus with both internal and external stakeholders, and they respond rapidly to data and insights. RallyBright can help your teams become more adaptable, driving each member to respond better and faster to setbacks and challenges at work.\n\u00a0\nSo how adaptable is your team? Find out with the RallyBright Team Adaptability Quiz, a quick and free survey \nhere\n.\nWOMEN IN TECH - BOSTON 2023 EVENT RECAP\n \nWomen Leaders Build Better Teams: Using Data to Improve Team Performance in a Hybrid World\nRallyBright's Chief Strategy Officer, \nMike Sweeney\n, spoke at the Women in Tech 2023 event in Boston, MA. With some helpful advice from his daughters, Mike presented RallyBright's case to the women leaders in the audience. Using our science-backed, data-driven tools is key to building better teams. Plus, the data already shows that women are often better leaders than men across the board.\n\u00a0\nIf you missed the event, check out the slides from Mike's presentation \nhere.\nRALLYBRIGHT LEADERSHIP EXPERIENCE DEMO\n \nA Lightweight Tool for Benchmarking Your Teams\nWe're excited to announce RallyBright's brand new Leadership Experience demo! Our platform gives leaders the science, software and skills to understand their team's strengths and development areas. Now leaders can gain these insights right out of the gate with our brand new demo. The Leadership Experience is a light, streamlined tool designed to help anyone jump in and get quick, actionable results for their teams.\u00a0\n\u00a0\nWe're also looking for anyone who would like to help us test out this new Leadership Experience! Please reach out to us at \ncs@rallybright.com\n if you're interested in giving the demo a try.\n \n \n \n \nLet's make this relationship LI-official!\nFollow us on LinkedIn and you'll get insights, news and resources about resilient leadership and inclusive teamwork.

    "body": "This month we're diving into why teams and leaders should embrace adaptability through change and disruption.\n \nHello, Melonya \u2014\n\u00a0\nIn this month's Resilient Teams newsletter, we have tips to share on embracing adaptability, driving more productive meetings at work, and more. For timely insights on staying adaptable through disruption, RallyBright founder and CEO John Estafanous has a brand new blog post through the Forbes Human Resources Council. We also have some new RallyBright platform resources to help your teams on their continuous growth journey.\n\u00a0\n\u2013Your friends at RallyBright\nLEARNING\n \nWhy Your Team Should Embrace Adaptability When Facing Disruption\nStaying\u00a0adaptable through challenges at work\u00a0can be tough. As leaders, when we\u2019re worried about everything that can go wrong, it\u2019s difficult to focus anywhere else. The stakes we face in high-level roles are usually high, and the price of failure can feel like too much to bear. But that is why it\u2019s crucial to keep a level head during times of change and disruption. After all, isn\u2019t it better to focus on recovering and growing from challenges?\n\u00a0\nIn times of immense change or disruption, focusing on adaptability is the key to your team's success. Learn more \nhere\n from RallyBright founder and CEO John Estafanous, in his post for the Forbes Human Resources Council.\nRALLYBRIGHT PLATFORM RESOURCES\n \nRallyBright Team Solutions: Unproductive Meetings at Work\nOne of the most common vulnerabilities among teams includes unproductive, useless, or ineffective meetings. These types of meetings can leave employees feeling disengaged at work. Team members tend to perceive meetings as unproductive when there\u2019s a lack of coordination or direction, or if they view their own work as more important than checking in with the group.\n\u00a0\nUnproductive meetings are usually a symptom of other common issues, such as friction between departments or a lack of shared direction.\n\u00a0\nCheck out our RallyBright resource \nhere\n for tips on driving more productive meetings for your teams.\n \nAn Overview of Team Communication Styles\nYour Team DISC style is an overview of how your team works at work, spread across four primary dimensions:\u00a0\nDominance (D)\n,\u00a0\nInfluencer (I)\n,\u00a0\nSteadiness (S)\n, and\u00a0\nConscientiousness (C)\n. It illustrates how all the different work styles on your team come together to form a cohesive unit and explores the types of behaviors that may be commonly accepted or criticized within the unit.\n\u00a0\nThere are numerous ways in which understanding your team DISC styles and adapting your leadership practice based on your team style can benefit you as a leader. Understanding these styles also benefits the team members you work with, and the organization that the team works within.\n\u00a0\nIf you're interested in learning more about Team DISC communication styles, you can find our platform resource \nhere\n.\n \n \n \n \n \nLet's make this relationship LI-official!\nFollow us on LinkedIn and you'll get insights, news and resources about resilient leadership and inclusive teamwork.
