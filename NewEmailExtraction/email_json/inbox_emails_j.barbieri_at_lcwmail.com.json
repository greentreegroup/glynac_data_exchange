There are a few questions I have here for the team \u2013\n\u00a0\nThe Ad Council proposal date was in 2022, the SOW issue date was in March, and the signed SOW date was 6/8. Should this be eligible for the commission since the proposal and SOW issue date was pre-BD Bonus Structure which started in Q2? It doesn\u2019t qualify for the proposal bonus.\u00a0 \n\u00a0\nIf this commission structure remains, this will need to be clarified and put in writing for Pedro. We were told SOW signature (not for counting towards a proposal creation, but for the percentage of the sale). An SOW is just a proposal until signed, and Hannah is responsible for this sale. We sent the attached, and then it was transitioned to Tamara, who received the signed SOW in June. \nWhat are we paying them for? If it is for proposal then this one seems to exist outside of the agreed timeframe. If it is for SOW signature then it seems to fall well within the timeframe for counting it. Am I missing something else here?\nUlteig is closed won. I don\u2019t see this quote in Compas. \n@Melissa Neu\n, can you confirm? \nThere was confusion with the consultant about whether the attached signed proposal is the same as a SOW. I\u2019ve confirmed with Andrea and discussed with Chuck that she will still need to create an SOW; it doesn\u2019t look like she has done so yet. However, per the attached, the client has committed and signed. \nShould Hannah be paid for the proposals sent after her departure date? (UL LLC, Bright Horizons, nVent, Hopechicago) If not, then the number of proposals for her is 33 (also excluding The Ad Council), which is one short of qualifying for the bonus of 34 total proposals sent for the QTR to qualify. \nHannah worked on Bright Horizons and HopeChicago.\u00a0 Hannah helped build the HopeChicago proposal, but I presented it to the client after she left. Also, the date isn\u2019t accurate for UL, LLC.in HubSpot. The deal was created well after the original proposal was sent on 5/9. I\u2019ll get HubSpot fixed, and I\u2019m attaching the proposal for your records.\n \nIf she was instrumental in getting these in front of the prospect I would reward them to her. It sounds like she was, but the proposals weren\u2019t sent until after she left. As long as we aren\u2019t double paying for these we were going to pay someone, correct?\n\u00a0\nThank you,\nJennifer\n\u00a0\nFrom:\n Melissa Neu <\nm.neu@lcwmail.com\n> \nSent:\n Thursday, July 6, 2023 7:25 PM\nTo:\n Alisa Kolodizner <\na.kolodizner@lcwmail.com\n>; Jennifer Barbieri <\nj.barbieri@lcwmail.com\n>; Chuck Adams <\nc.adams@lcwmail.com\n>\nCc:\n Maria Mercado <\nm.mercado@lcwmail.com\n>; Briza Cardenas <\nb.cardenas@lcwmail.com\n>\nSubject:\n RE: Bonus Payout -BD Team\n\u00a0\nHi Everyone,\n\u00a0\nPlease see the attached report with updates.

Your efforts helped me to review the accuracy of the data as it is being pulled from HubSpot. The report feature I used was not entirely accurate, so I\u2019ve updated the attached report for you today and worked on troubleshooting the issue. The attached has removed any proposals in progress and Deb\u2019s pursuits that we were not involved in. Moog is The only existing client I have record of building a proposal for this quarter.\n\u00a0\nTracking proposals sent by the date is tricky for a few reasons, including that there is no HubSpot reporting feature to pull a deal status change date. Since we don\u2019t only create proposals only in HubSpot and often make proposals that other individual emails to the prospect, this information is typically tracked via email correspondence and notes, I will need to work with Pedro to create a new process that makes the data that you can pull more accurate. \n\u00a0\nOne immediate change is that I\u2019ve created multiple workflows to log the date a deal status is changed to Proposal Sent, Negotiation, and Passed to Consultant. This change will allow folks to quickly look at the left sidebar to see the dates and allow the team to pull a report with the data going forward. Keep in mind it can\u2019t work retroactively; however, it will help Pedro to report progress to you in Q3.\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\nI will work with Pedro to ensure that any changes to the attached are captured in HubSpot by EOB Friday, and I will provide you with a final report at that time.\n\u00a0\nPlease let me know if you have any questions or need additional information.\n\u00a0\nKind regards,\n\u00a0\nMelissa\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\nC.

There are a few questions I have here for the team \u2013\n\u00a0\nThe Ad Council proposal date was in 2022, the SOW issue date was in March, and the signed SOW date was 6/8. Should this be eligible for the commission since the proposal and SOW issue date was pre-BD Bonus Structure which started in Q2? It doesn\u2019t qualify for the proposal bonus.\u00a0 \n\u00a0\nIf this commission structure remains, this will need to be clarified and put in writing for Pedro. We were told SOW signature (not for counting towards a proposal creation, but for the percentage of the sale). An SOW is just a proposal until signed, and Hannah is responsible for this sale. We sent the attached, and then it was transitioned to Tamara, who received the signed SOW in June. \nUlteig is closed won. I don\u2019t see this quote in Compas. \n@Melissa Neu\n, can you confirm? \nThere was confusion with the consultant about whether the attached signed proposal is the same as a SOW. I\u2019ve confirmed with Andrea and discussed with Chuck that she will still need to create an SOW; it doesn\u2019t look like she has done so yet. However, per the attached, the client has committed and signed. \nShould Hannah be paid for the proposals sent after her departure date? (UL LLC, Bright Horizons, nVent, Hopechicago) If not, then the number of proposals for her is 33 (also excluding The Ad Council), which is one short of qualifying for the bonus of 34 total proposals sent for the QTR to qualify. \nHannah worked on Bright Horizons and HopeChicago.\u00a0 Hannah helped build the HopeChicago proposal, but I presented it to the client after she left. Also, the date isn\u2019t accurate for UL, LLC.in HubSpot. The deal was created well after the original proposal was sent on 5/9. I\u2019ll get HubSpot fixed, and I\u2019m attaching the proposal for your records.\n\u00a0\nThank you,\nJennifer\n\u00a0\nFrom:\n Melissa Neu <\nm.neu@lcwmail.com\n> \nSent:\n Thursday, July 6, 2023 7:25 PM\nTo:\n Alisa Kolodizner <\na.kolodizner@lcwmail.com\n>; Jennifer Barbieri <\nj.barbieri@lcwmail.com\n>; Chuck Adams <\nc.adams@lcwmail.com\n>\nCc:\n Maria Mercado <\nm.mercado@lcwmail.com\n>; Briza Cardenas <\nb.cardenas@lcwmail.com\n>\nSubject:\n RE: Bonus Payout -BD Team\n\u00a0\nHi Everyone,\n\u00a0\nPlease see the attached report with updates.

Your efforts helped me to review the accuracy of the data as it is being pulled from HubSpot. The report feature I used was not entirely accurate, so I\u2019ve updated the attached report for you today and worked on troubleshooting the issue. The attached has removed any proposals in progress and Deb\u2019s pursuits that we were not involved in. Moog is The only existing client I have record of building a proposal for this quarter.\n\u00a0\nTracking proposals sent by the date is tricky for a few reasons, including that there is no HubSpot reporting feature to pull a deal status change date. Since we don\u2019t only create proposals only in HubSpot and often make proposals that other individual emails to the prospect, this information is typically tracked via email correspondence and notes, I will need to work with Pedro to create a new process that makes the data that you can pull more accurate. \n\u00a0\nOne immediate change is that I\u2019ve created multiple workflows to log the date a deal status is changed to Proposal Sent, Negotiation, and Passed to Consultant. This change will allow folks to quickly look at the left sidebar to see the dates and allow the team to pull a report with the data going forward. Keep in mind it can\u2019t work retroactively; however, it will help Pedro to report progress to you in Q3.\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\nI will work with Pedro to ensure that any changes to the attached are captured in HubSpot by EOB Friday, and I will provide you with a final report at that time.\n\u00a0\nPlease let me know if you have any questions or need additional information.\n\u00a0\nKind regards,\n\u00a0\nMelissa\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\nC.

Let\u2019s discuss the following:\n\u00a0\nAccording to Hubspot, I see 2 more accounts that Deb is handling (Women Lift Health and Upwardly Global) to make a total of 4. If we exclude all of Deb\u2019s accounts with the exception of Pfizer per your note, the total number of accounts are now 32 which is less than the 34 minimum to qualify for the bonus\nI added in a column for Date Proposal Sent. There are some accounts which do not have a proposal attachment in Hubspot and I don\u2019t know when the proposal was actually sent. Please fill in the missing information so we can evaluate these accounts\nThe bonus specifically states proposals sent. I don\u2019t think we should be including the proposal in progress stage. There are 3 here on the list \n@Alisa Kolodizner\n and \n@Chuck Adams\n please weigh in here\nCommissions are based on executed SOWs so the only account eligible to be paid out commissions on is Insight. SOWs signature pending should not \n@Alisa Kolodizner\n and \n@Chuck Adams\n please weigh in here\n\u00a0\nHappy to discuss further and answer any questions you may have.\n\u00a0\nThank you,\nJennifer\n\u00a0\nFrom:\n Melissa Neu <\nm.neu@lcwmail.com\n> \nSent:\n Thursday, June 22, 2023 2:20 PM\nTo:\n Jennifer Barbieri <\nj.barbieri@lcwmail.com\n>\nCc:\n Maria Mercado <\nm.mercado@lcwmail.com\n>; Chuck Adams <\nc.adams@lcwmail.com\n>; Alisa Kolodizner <\na.kolodizner@lcwmail.com\n>; Briza Cardenas <\nb.cardenas@lcwmail.com\n>\nSubject:\n RE: Bonus Payout -BD Team\n\u00a0\nHi Jennifer,\n\u00a0\nHere\u2019s a report for your review.\u00a0 Do you need additional information?
