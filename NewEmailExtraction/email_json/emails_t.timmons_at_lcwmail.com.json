Exec Sponsorship Program.\u00a0 \u00a0I also requested LCW\u2019s assistance in providing meaningful content and facilitation for session 2 of the Latin X Executive Sponsorship Program (BTW-\u00a0 It took considerable effort to convince Jason, that LCW is needed to deliver a meaningful and believable Latin X program for the sponsors.)\u00a0 My email (attached below) also mentions the possibility of providing executive coaching and support.\n\u00a0\nChuck is included on this email and will reach out to you separately to ensure that his team is aligned with your understanding and expectations.\u00a0 \u00a0Given that I/Redhouse will be pausing operations for 6-8 weeks, I recommended that LCW prepare a brief proposal and execute an agreement/statement of work directly with Danaher Corp D+I.\u00a0\u00a0 Hoping LCW\u2019s previous extensive work with Corporate D+I will help make the contracting process move quickly.\n\u00a0\nI will leave it to the two of you to correct and realign the understanding as needed.\u00a0 I know that I\u2019m passing the baton on these projects to a team who will deliver with excellence.\u00a0 \n\u00a0\nBest regards,\nArlene F.

Our conversation with Lynne Anne went really well, she shared a lot of perspectives that we think will be helpful for global inclusion. It was after our conversation with her that we realized we didn\u2019t have any data from anyone situated in Australia or New Zealand (Pacific) so that\u2019s the gap we were hoping to fill. However, it might also be a good idea for us to speak with Patti Malay and get a different leadership perspective from another part of the region. Could we set that up?\n\u00a0\nTamara\n\u00a0\nFrom:\n Rachel Coleman (FleishmanHillard) <\nRachel.Coleman@fleishman.com\n> \nSent:\n Thursday, August 25, 2022 4:22 PM\nTo:\n Tamara Thorpe <\nt.thorpe@lcwmail.com\n>; Daniel Gough <\nd.gough@lcwmail.com\n>; Vince Bongiovanni <\nv.bongiovanni@lcwmail.com\n>; Tahitia Timmons <\nt.timmons@lcwmail.com\n>\nCc:\n Adrianne Smith (FleishmanHillard) <\nadrianne.smith@fleishman.com\n>\nSubject:\n RE: Our call today\n\u00a0\nExcellent! I have that date and time held on our side, so I can update the invite tomorrow morning and add you all in. And yes, very excited to have that last interview scheduled and glad it isn\u2019t too far into September! \n\u00a0\nIn terms of getting more input from the Pacific region, we do have a wonderful colleague named Patti Malay, who is the GM of our Manila office and also serves as our DE&I director for the APAC region. She has really great knowledge of the region, especially the DE&I issues that exist in different countries, and I know she would be happy to chat with you. Let me know what you think. We can probably get something scheduled fairly quickly as Patti is usually pretty responsive and flexible. \n\u00a0\nJust curious, how did the interview with Lynne Anne Davis go? She is oversees our whole APAC region, so I was hoping she would have some good input to share. \n\u00a0\nThanks! \n\u00a0\nFrom:\n Tamara Thorpe <\nt.thorpe@lcwmail.com\n> \nSent:\n Thursday, August 25, 2022 5:11 PM\nTo:\n Rachel Coleman (FleishmanHillard) <\nRachel.Coleman@fleishman.com\n>; Daniel Gough <\nd.gough@lcwmail.com\n>; Vince Bongiovanni <\nv.bongiovanni@lcwmail.com\n>; Tahitia Timmons <\nt.timmons@lcwmail.com\n>\nCc:\n Adrianne Smith (FleishmanHillard) <\nadrianne.smith@fleishman.com\n>\nSubject:\n RE: Our call today\n\u00a0\nHello Rachel,\n\u00a0\nThanks for your patience.

We are anticipating having a preliminary report for you all mid-September in advance of the read out on the 29\nth\n.\n\u00a0\nUntil then, we are continuing our review and analysis, and we have noted an absence of data and input from the Pacific region, in both the APAC Focus Groups and Interviews, and surveys. Is there any data that you think would give us a broader picture of APAC, and or someone you think we should speak to who could provide insights?\n\u00a0\nThanks,\nTamara\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\nFrom:\n Rachel Coleman (FleishmanHillard) <\nRachel.Coleman@fleishman.com\n> \nSent:\n Wednesday, August 24, 2022 2:30 PM\nTo:\n Tamara Thorpe <\nt.thorpe@lcwmail.com\n>; Daniel Gough <\nd.gough@lcwmail.com\n>; Vince Bongiovanni <\nv.bongiovanni@lcwmail.com\n>; Tahitia Timmons <\nt.timmons@lcwmail.com\n>\nCc:\n Adrianne Smith (FleishmanHillard) <\nadrianne.smith@fleishman.com\n>\nSubject:\n Re: Our call today\n\u00a0\nHi team - Following up on this.

Any chance that could work for your team? \n\u00a0\nIf not, it\u2019d be great if you can share a few other options, and I can work with the team to see what is flexible. Heads up, I\u2019m out the whole week of 9/19 traveling for work, so my availability that week is pretty limited. \n\u00a0\nI\u2019m hoping to get this scheduled ASAP because schedules are already looking challenging, and I know Adrianne, J.J. and Lisa are all eager to get something on the books to hear about next steps. Please let me know when you get a chance. \n\u00a0\nAlso, I\u2019m sharing a short presentation that our team recently pulled together.

Do you have a date in mind that you\u2019d like to regroup? Or should we circle back on that once we have the last two stakeholder interviews scheduled? Also, Adrianne and I talked about the initial readout, and that will likely be Adrianne, Lisa, J.J. and myself. I know we still have some time, but let us know when we should start looking at dates for that. There might be one or two other groups that we want to review the findings, but we can decide on that as we get closer. \n\u00a0\nOne small request from me. I have a call with one of our APAC DE&I leaders and she was wondering how the APAC focus groups went. Could the team send just a few sentences that I could have on hand to send to her? My call with her is Monday evening.

At this point Thursday, 7/7: 11am-12pm CT is probably the best option so let me know if I should look at the second/third weeks of July too. \n1:1 Stakeholder Interviews\nScheduling\n: LCW working on time blocks. I also have a meeting with Lisa Moehlenkamp tomorrow to give her a heads up that we\u2019re starting to schedule. \nQuestions:\n FH/LCW to finalize questions. \nI know your team is working on those based on our conversation last week. \nTo Adrianne\u2019s point on the call, we think there are three \u201cthemes\u201d to these conversations: Personal commitment, accountability (for themselves and others) and I also think hearing their perspective on existing barriers or challenges that make it harder for them or their teams to make inclusion a priority, such as business demands from the firm. \nAlso, if there are any other themes that have emerged from the focus groups that we want to ask about, such as the point that Dan brought up about utilization, that is great too. \nI also gave this some thought so sharing some ideas below. \nWhat personal goals/commitments have you made as it relates to DE&I? Can you share an example of actions that have supported those commitments?\nAs a leader, how are you holding yourself accountable? How do you hold other leaders and managers on your team accountable?\nWhere does DE&I fit in with your other business priorities?\nWould love thoughts on this one. I think it\u2019s easy to say that DE&I is a priority but actually practicing that is more difficult. I think our focus on utilization is a great example. So I want to ask a question that digs into what DE&I being a priority looks like \nin action\n for these leaders beyond just\u00a0 \u201cvoicing support.\u201d \nFrom the GM deck: Which processes or policies limit or enhance a culture of inclusion and sense of belonging at FleishmanHillard? What is working or not working?\nDE&I Certification Exploratory Conversation: Confirmed for 6/30\n\u00a0\nLMK if there is anything I missed. \n\u00a0\nThanks!\nRachel \n\u00a0\nRachel Coleman (She/Her)\nVice President \n|\n \nReputation \nFleishmanHillard\n \n|\n \n225 N.
