Exec Sponsorship Program.\u00a0 \u00a0I also requested LCW\u2019s assistance in providing meaningful content and facilitation for session 2 of the Latin X Executive Sponsorship Program (BTW-\u00a0 It took considerable effort to convince Jason, that LCW is needed to deliver a meaningful and believable Latin X program for the sponsors.)\u00a0 My email (attached below) also mentions the possibility of providing executive coaching and support.\n\u00a0\nChuck is included on this email and will reach out to you separately to ensure that his team is aligned with your understanding and expectations.\u00a0 \u00a0Given that I/Redhouse will be pausing operations for 6-8 weeks, I recommended that LCW prepare a brief proposal and execute an agreement/statement of work directly with Danaher Corp D+I.\u00a0\u00a0 Hoping LCW\u2019s previous extensive work with Corporate D+I will help make the contracting process move quickly.\n\u00a0\nI will leave it to the two of you to correct and realign the understanding as needed.\u00a0 I know that I\u2019m passing the baton on these projects to a team who will deliver with excellence.\u00a0 \n\u00a0\nBest regards,\nArlene F.

Our conversation with Lynne Anne went really well, she shared a lot of perspectives that we think will be helpful for global inclusion. It was after our conversation with her that we realized we didn\u2019t have any data from anyone situated in Australia or New Zealand (Pacific) so that\u2019s the gap we were hoping to fill. However, it might also be a good idea for us to speak with Patti Malay and get a different leadership perspective from another part of the region. Could we set that up?\n\u00a0\nTamara\n\u00a0\nFrom:\n Rachel Coleman (FleishmanHillard) <\nRachel.Coleman@fleishman.com\n> \nSent:\n Thursday, August 25, 2022 4:22 PM\nTo:\n Tamara Thorpe <\nt.thorpe@lcwmail.com\n>; Daniel Gough <\nd.gough@lcwmail.com\n>; Vince Bongiovanni <\nv.bongiovanni@lcwmail.com\n>; Tahitia Timmons <\nt.timmons@lcwmail.com\n>\nCc:\n Adrianne Smith (FleishmanHillard) <\nadrianne.smith@fleishman.com\n>\nSubject:\n RE: Our call today\n\u00a0\nExcellent! I have that date and time held on our side, so I can update the invite tomorrow morning and add you all in. And yes, very excited to have that last interview scheduled and glad it isn\u2019t too far into September! \n\u00a0\nIn terms of getting more input from the Pacific region, we do have a wonderful colleague named Patti Malay, who is the GM of our Manila office and also serves as our DE&I director for the APAC region. She has really great knowledge of the region, especially the DE&I issues that exist in different countries, and I know she would be happy to chat with you. Let me know what you think. We can probably get something scheduled fairly quickly as Patti is usually pretty responsive and flexible. \n\u00a0\nJust curious, how did the interview with Lynne Anne Davis go? She is oversees our whole APAC region, so I was hoping she would have some good input to share. \n\u00a0\nThanks! \n\u00a0\nFrom:\n Tamara Thorpe <\nt.thorpe@lcwmail.com\n> \nSent:\n Thursday, August 25, 2022 5:11 PM\nTo:\n Rachel Coleman (FleishmanHillard) <\nRachel.Coleman@fleishman.com\n>; Daniel Gough <\nd.gough@lcwmail.com\n>; Vince Bongiovanni <\nv.bongiovanni@lcwmail.com\n>; Tahitia Timmons <\nt.timmons@lcwmail.com\n>\nCc:\n Adrianne Smith (FleishmanHillard) <\nadrianne.smith@fleishman.com\n>\nSubject:\n RE: Our call today\n\u00a0\nHello Rachel,\n\u00a0\nThanks for your patience.

We are anticipating having a preliminary report for you all mid-September in advance of the read out on the 29\nth\n.\n\u00a0\nUntil then, we are continuing our review and analysis, and we have noted an absence of data and input from the Pacific region, in both the APAC Focus Groups and Interviews, and surveys.

Any chance that could work for your team? \n\u00a0\nIf not, it\u2019d be great if you can share a few other options, and I can work with the team to see what is flexible. Heads up, I\u2019m out the whole week of 9/19 traveling for work, so my availability that week is pretty limited. \n\u00a0\nI\u2019m hoping to get this scheduled ASAP because schedules are already looking challenging, and I know Adrianne, J.J. and Lisa are all eager to get something on the books to hear about next steps.

Do you have a date in mind that you\u2019d like to regroup? Or should we circle back on that once we have the last two stakeholder interviews scheduled? Also, Adrianne and I talked about the initial readout, and that will likely be Adrianne, Lisa, J.J. and myself. I know we still have some time, but let us know when we should start looking at dates for that. There might be one or two other groups that we want to review the findings, but we can decide on that as we get closer. \n\u00a0\nOne small request from me. I have a call with one of our APAC DE&I leaders and she was wondering how the APAC focus groups went. Could the team send just a few sentences that I could have on hand to send to her? My call with her is Monday evening.

At this point Thursday, 7/7: 11am-12pm CT is probably the best option so let me know if I should look at the second/third weeks of July too. \n1:1 Stakeholder Interviews\nScheduling\n: LCW working on time blocks. I also have a meeting with Lisa Moehlenkamp tomorrow to give her a heads up that we\u2019re starting to schedule. \nQuestions:\n FH/LCW to finalize questions. \nI know your team is working on those based on our conversation last week. \nTo Adrianne\u2019s point on the call, we think there are three \u201cthemes\u201d to these conversations: Personal commitment, accountability (for themselves and others) and I also think hearing their perspective on existing barriers or challenges that make it harder for them or their teams to make inclusion a priority, such as business demands from the firm. \nAlso, if there are any other themes that have emerged from the focus groups that we want to ask about, such as the point that Dan brought up about utilization, that is great too. \nI also gave this some thought so sharing some ideas below. \nWhat personal goals/commitments have you made as it relates to DE&I? Can you share an example of actions that have supported those commitments?\nAs a leader, how are you holding yourself accountable? How do you hold other leaders and managers on your team accountable?\nWhere does DE&I fit in with your other business priorities?\nWould love thoughts on this one. I think it\u2019s easy to say that DE&I is a priority but actually practicing that is more difficult. I think our focus on utilization is a great example. So I want to ask a question that digs into what DE&I being a priority looks like \nin action\n for these leaders beyond just\u00a0 \u201cvoicing support.\u201d \nFrom the GM deck: Which processes or policies limit or enhance a culture of inclusion and sense of belonging at FleishmanHillard? What is working or not working?\nDE&I Certification Exploratory Conversation: Confirmed for 6/30\n\u00a0\nLMK if there is anything I missed. \n\u00a0\nThanks!\nRachel \n\u00a0\nRachel Coleman (She/Her)\nVice President \n|\n \nReputation \nFleishmanHillard\n \n|\n \n225 N.

Our conversation with Lynne Anne went really well, she shared a lot of perspectives that we think will be helpful for global inclusion. It was after our conversation with her that we realized we didn\u2019t have any data from anyone situated in Australia or New Zealand (Pacific) so that\u2019s the gap we were hoping to fill. However, it might also be a good idea for us to speak with Patti Malay and get a different leadership perspective from another part of the region.

And yes, very excited to have that last interview scheduled and glad it isn\u2019t too far into September! \n\u00a0\nIn terms of getting more input from the Pacific region, we do have a wonderful colleague named Patti Malay, who is the GM of our Manila office and also serves as our DE&I director for the APAC region. She has really great knowledge of the region, especially the DE&I issues that exist in different countries, and I know she would be happy to chat with you. Let me know what you think. We can probably get something scheduled fairly quickly as Patti is usually pretty responsive and flexible. \n\u00a0\nJust curious, how did the interview with Lynne Anne Davis go?

We are anticipating having a preliminary report for you all mid-September in advance of the read out on the 29\nth\n.\n\u00a0\nUntil then, we are continuing our review and analysis, and we have noted an absence of data and input from the Pacific region, in both the APAC Focus Groups and Interviews, and surveys.

Do you have a date in mind that you\u2019d like to regroup? Or should we circle back on that once we have the last two stakeholder interviews scheduled? Also, Adrianne and I talked about the initial readout, and that will likely be Adrianne, Lisa, J.J. and myself. I know we still have some time, but let us know when we should start looking at dates for that. There might be one or two other groups that we want to review the findings, but we can decide on that as we get closer. \n\u00a0\nOne small request from me. I have a call with one of our APAC DE&I leaders and she was wondering how the APAC focus groups went. Could the team send just a few sentences that I could have on hand to send to her? My call with her is Monday evening. LMK if that works. \n\u00a0\nThanks, \nRachel \u00a0\n\u00a0\nFrom:\n Tamara Thorpe <\nt.thorpe@lcwmail.com\n> \nSent:\n Thursday, August 4, 2022 12:03 PM\nTo:\n Rachel Coleman (FleishmanHillard) <\nRachel.Coleman@fleishman.com\n>; Daniel Gough <\nd.gough@lcwmail.com\n>; Vince Bongiovanni <\nv.bongiovanni@lcwmail.com\n>; Tahitia Timmons <\nt.timmons@lcwmail.com\n>\nCc:\n Adrianne Smith (FleishmanHillard) <\nadrianne.smith@fleishman.com\n>\nSubject:\n RE: Our call today\n\u00a0\nHello Rachel,\n\u00a0\nLast weeks interview went great!

At this point Thursday, 7/7: 11am-12pm CT is probably the best option so let me know if I should look at the second/third weeks of July too. \n1:1 Stakeholder Interviews\nScheduling\n: LCW working on time blocks. I also have a meeting with Lisa Moehlenkamp tomorrow to give her a heads up that we\u2019re starting to schedule. \nQuestions:\n FH/LCW to finalize questions. \nI know your team is working on those based on our conversation last week. \nTo Adrianne\u2019s point on the call, we think there are three \u201cthemes\u201d to these conversations: Personal commitment, accountability (for themselves and others) and I also think hearing their perspective on existing barriers or challenges that make it harder for them or their teams to make inclusion a priority, such as business demands from the firm. \nAlso, if there are any other themes that have emerged from the focus groups that we want to ask about, such as the point that Dan brought up about utilization, that is great too. \nI also gave this some thought so sharing some ideas below. \nWhat personal goals/commitments have you made as it relates to DE&I? Can you share an example of actions that have supported those commitments?\nAs a leader, how are you holding yourself accountable? How do you hold other leaders and managers on your team accountable?\nWhere does DE&I fit in with your other business priorities?\nWould love thoughts on this one. I think it\u2019s easy to say that DE&I is a priority but actually practicing that is more difficult. I think our focus on utilization is a great example. So I want to ask a question that digs into what DE&I being a priority looks like \nin action\n for these leaders beyond just\u00a0 \u201cvoicing support.\u201d \nFrom the GM deck: Which processes or policies limit or enhance a culture of inclusion and sense of belonging at FleishmanHillard? What is working or not working?\nDE&I Certification Exploratory Conversation: Confirmed for 6/30\n\u00a0\nLMK if there is anything I missed. \n\u00a0\nThanks!\nRachel \n\u00a0\nRachel Coleman (She/Her)\nVice President \n|\n \nReputation \nFleishmanHillard\n \n|\n \n225 N.

And yes, very excited to have that last interview scheduled and glad it isn\u2019t too far into September! \n\u00a0\nIn terms of getting more input from the Pacific region, we do have a wonderful colleague named Patti Malay, who is the GM of our Manila office and also serves as our DE&I director for the APAC region. She has really great knowledge of the region, especially the DE&I issues that exist in different countries, and I know she would be happy to chat with you. Let me know what you think. We can probably get something scheduled fairly quickly as Patti is usually pretty responsive and flexible. \n\u00a0\nJust curious, how did the interview with Lynne Anne Davis go?

Do you have a date in mind that you\u2019d like to regroup? Or should we circle back on that once we have the last two stakeholder interviews scheduled? Also, Adrianne and I talked about the initial readout, and that will likely be Adrianne, Lisa, J.J. and myself.

There might be one or two other groups that we want to review the findings, but we can decide on that as we get closer. \n\u00a0\nOne small request from me. I have a call with one of our APAC DE&I leaders and she was wondering how the APAC focus groups went. Could the team send just a few sentences that I could have on hand to send to her?

I also have a meeting with Lisa Moehlenkamp tomorrow to give her a heads up that we\u2019re starting to schedule. \nQuestions:\n FH/LCW to finalize questions. \nI know your team is working on those based on our conversation last week. \nTo Adrianne\u2019s point on the call, we think there are three \u201cthemes\u201d to these conversations: Personal commitment, accountability (for themselves and others) and I also think hearing their perspective on existing barriers or challenges that make it harder for them or their teams to make inclusion a priority, such as business demands from the firm. \nAlso, if there are any other themes that have emerged from the focus groups that we want to ask about, such as the point that Dan brought up about utilization, that is great too. \nI also gave this some thought so sharing some ideas below. \nWhat personal goals/commitments have you made as it relates to DE&I? Can you share an example of actions that have supported those commitments?\nAs a leader, how are you holding yourself accountable? How do you hold other leaders and managers on your team accountable?\nWhere does DE&I fit in with your other business priorities?\nWould love thoughts on this one. I think it\u2019s easy to say that DE&I is a priority but actually practicing that is more difficult. I think our focus on utilization is a great example. So I want to ask a question that digs into what DE&I being a priority looks like \nin action\n for these leaders beyond just\u00a0 \u201cvoicing support.\u201d \nFrom the GM deck: Which processes or policies limit or enhance a culture of inclusion and sense of belonging at FleishmanHillard?

There might be one or two other groups that we want to review the findings, but we can decide on that as we get closer. \n\u00a0\nOne small request from me. I have a call with one of our APAC DE&I leaders and she was wondering how the APAC focus groups went. Could the team send just a few sentences that I could have on hand to send to her?

I also have a meeting with Lisa Moehlenkamp tomorrow to give her a heads up that we\u2019re starting to schedule. \nQuestions:\n FH/LCW to finalize questions. \nI know your team is working on those based on our conversation last week. \nTo Adrianne\u2019s point on the call, we think there are three \u201cthemes\u201d to these conversations: Personal commitment, accountability (for themselves and others) and I also think hearing their perspective on existing barriers or challenges that make it harder for them or their teams to make inclusion a priority, such as business demands from the firm. \nAlso, if there are any other themes that have emerged from the focus groups that we want to ask about, such as the point that Dan brought up about utilization, that is great too. \nI also gave this some thought so sharing some ideas below. \nWhat personal goals/commitments have you made as it relates to DE&I? Can you share an example of actions that have supported those commitments?\nAs a leader, how are you holding yourself accountable? How do you hold other leaders and managers on your team accountable?\nWhere does DE&I fit in with your other business priorities?\nWould love thoughts on this one. I think it\u2019s easy to say that DE&I is a priority but actually practicing that is more difficult. I think our focus on utilization is a great example. So I want to ask a question that digs into what DE&I being a priority looks like \nin action\n for these leaders beyond just\u00a0 \u201cvoicing support.\u201d \nFrom the GM deck: Which processes or policies limit or enhance a culture of inclusion and sense of belonging at FleishmanHillard? What is working or not working?\nDE&I Certification Exploratory Conversation: Confirmed for 6/30\n\u00a0\nLMK if there is anything I missed. \n\u00a0\nThanks!\nRachel \n\u00a0\nRachel Coleman (She/Her)\nVice President \n|\n \nReputation \nFleishmanHillard\n \n|\n \n225 N.

Yet, many organizations\u00a0do not consider this important\u00a0part of workers\u2019 identities outside the Christian faith. In practicing cultural competency, it is crucial that organizations move beyond religious tolerance and toward inclusion\u00ad\u00ad\u2014especially for non-Christian faiths and non-faiths\u2014to ensure equitable policies for their diverse communities.\nIn this conversation, Culture Moments host Larry Baker (he/him) and DEI consultant Rahimeh Ramizany (she/her) delve into the complexities of faith in the workplace, drawing on Rahimeh\u2019s experience as a consultant, speaker, DEI expert, and multiethnic, neurodiverse, visibly Muslim American woman.\nLive stream link (YouTube):\n\u00a0\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s4a4WvXkDDo\nLive stream link (LinkedIn):\n\u00a0\nhttps://www.linkedin.com/video/event/urn:li:ugcPost:6964983243003621376/\nPlease reach out to \nmarketing@lcwmail.com\n with any questions or issues.\nSee you soon! \n \n \n \n \nCopyright \u00a9 2022 Language & Culture Worldwide, LLC, All rights reserved.\nOur mailing address is:\nLanguage & Culture Worldwide, LLC\n100 S Saunders Rd, Suite 150\nLake Forest, IL 60045\nWant to change how you receive these emails?\nYou can \nupdate your preferences\n or \nunsubscribe from this list\n.",

Yet, many workplaces do not consider this crucial part of workers\u2019 identities outside the Christian faith. In practicing cultural competency, it is crucial that organizations move beyond religious tolerance and toward inclusion\u00ad\u00ad\u2014especially for non-Christian faiths and non-faiths\u2014to ensure equitable policies for their diverse communities.\nIn this conversation, Culture Moments host Larry Baker (he/him) and DEI consultant Rahimeh Ramizany (she/her) delve into the complexities of faith in the workplace, drawing on Rahimeh\u2019s experience as a consultant, speaker, DEI expert, and multiethnic, neurodiverse, visibly Muslim American woman.\nYou can join the conversation by attending this complimentary live stream session. Whether you\u2019re a practitioner, ally, or leader, we invite you to join this discussion and bring your questions for our experts.\nLive stream link:\n\u00a0\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s4a4WvXkDDo\nSee you soon!\n\u00a0\nClick here to join!\n \nNot already following LCW on social?\nFollow LCW on your favorite channel and never miss content like this live stream again!\n \n \n \nCopyright \u00a9 2022 Language & Culture Worldwide, LLC, All rights reserved.\nOur mailing address is:\n100 S Saunders Rd, Suite 150\nLake Forest, IL 60045\nWant to change how you receive these emails?\nYou can \nupdate your preferences\n or \nunsubscribe from this list\n.",

I know there\u2019s voice over attached as well, so we\u2019d probably have to remove the voice over (and not just for this one, but for each of the examples in this section, since it would be odd to have voice over for all the others). We adjusted the copy in the text below it, but not in the top line.\u00a0 And yes, even though HB7 has a temporary injunction, it \u2018s possible we could see it again if it\u2019s appealed, and so I\u2019d hate to have to go into this module again.\u00a0 I\u2019d love your thoughts on how do-able this would be, so that we can wrap up this work. \n\u00a0\n\u00a0\nFrom:\n Tahitia Timmons <\nt.timmons@lcwmail.com\n> \nSent:\n Friday, August 19, 2022 12:01 PM\nTo:\n Marisa Afzali <\nMarisa_Afzali@Progressive.com\n>\nCc:\n Kelly Salek <\nk.salek@lcwmail.com\n>\nSubject:\n [EXTERNAL] RE: Progressive Review Links Enclosed\n\u00a0\nHi Marisa. \nI am sure you are already aware but the judge ruled the Woke act violated constitutionality.

Do you have a date in mind that you\u2019d like to regroup? Or should we circle back on that once we have the last two stakeholder interviews scheduled? Also, Adrianne and I talked about the initial readout, and that will likely be Adrianne, Lisa, J.J. and myself. I know we still have some time, but let us know when we should start looking at dates for that. There might be one or two other groups that we want to review the findings, but we can decide on that as we get closer. \n\u00a0\nOne small request from me. I have a call with one of our APAC DE&I leaders and she was wondering how the APAC focus groups went. Could the team send just a few sentences that I could have on hand to send to her?

At this point Thursday, 7/7: 11am-12pm CT is probably the best option so let me know if I should look at the second/third weeks of July too. \n1:1 Stakeholder Interviews\nScheduling\n: LCW working on time blocks. I also have a meeting with Lisa Moehlenkamp tomorrow to give her a heads up that we\u2019re starting to schedule. \nQuestions:\n FH/LCW to finalize questions. \nI know your team is working on those based on our conversation last week. \nTo Adrianne\u2019s point on the call, we think there are three \u201cthemes\u201d to these conversations: Personal commitment, accountability (for themselves and others) and I also think hearing their perspective on existing barriers or challenges that make it harder for them or their teams to make inclusion a priority, such as business demands from the firm. \nAlso, if there are any other themes that have emerged from the focus groups that we want to ask about, such as the point that Dan brought up about utilization, that is great too. \nI also gave this some thought so sharing some ideas below. \nWhat personal goals/commitments have you made as it relates to DE&I? Can you share an example of actions that have supported those commitments?\nAs a leader, how are you holding yourself accountable? How do you hold other leaders and managers on your team accountable?\nWhere does DE&I fit in with your other business priorities?\nWould love thoughts on this one. I think it\u2019s easy to say that DE&I is a priority but actually practicing that is more difficult. I think our focus on utilization is a great example. So I want to ask a question that digs into what DE&I being a priority looks like \nin action\n for these leaders beyond just\u00a0 \u201cvoicing support.\u201d \nFrom the GM deck: Which processes or policies limit or enhance a culture of inclusion and sense of belonging at FleishmanHillard? What is working or not working?\nDE&I Certification Exploratory Conversation: Confirmed for 6/30\n\u00a0\nLMK if there is anything I missed. \n\u00a0\nThanks!\nRachel \n\u00a0\nRachel Coleman (She/Her)\nVice President \n|\n \nReputation \nFleishmanHillard\n \n|\n \n225 N.

It was such a pleasure to get to know more about you, your perspective, and your various offerings. After some consideration, we agreed that utilizing you for Pride month might be putting you in too small of a box \u2013 you have so much more to offer. We are drawn to you as a speaker because of your unique intersectionality, and we want every aspect of that to have the opportunity to shine because it is what makes you such a great fit for our organization. We would like to utilize you for a 45 min session next year, likely February. The topic would be open ended, but we hope you may be able to speak about your experiences with intersectionality as well as sharing ways in which our clinicians can help to promote health equity. Can you please confirm what your cost would be for this session?

I included the facilitated learnings we discussed and three micro learnings with pricing. As I mentioned they are moving away from the current eLearning model toward an LMS (soft launch end of Q4). I have these at 25 users and 6 months (they are not doing 12 months). \u00a0There were also price increases since the list you shared and I cannot override them BUT I was able to still have the 25% show up, however that is contingent on the prepay and 4+ and will no longer be available moving forward\nI am also enclosing a link to a zip folder with pdfs of the facilitated titles we discussed. \nThat is available here \nhttps://www.dropbox.com/l/AACk8tB0EdaazCqPPmltk1-8gcXTHuk8WVs\nPlease let me know that this opens and is viewable. \nHopefully this will assist you when you meet with the group on Monday. \nThanks and have a great weekend!\n\u00a0\nTahitia\n\u00a0\n------------------------------------------------------\nTahitia Timmons\n(she/her/hers)\nSenior Consultant\nLCW \n100 S Saunders Rd, Suite 150\nLake Forest, IL 60045\n\u00a0 \n\u00a0\n \n\u00a0\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\nwww\n\u00a0\n|\n\u00a0\nTwitter\n \n|\n\u00a0\nFacebook\n\u00a0\n|\n\u00a0\nLinkedIn",

Your Scoro site \nlcw.scoro.com\n has been updated!\nAccurately tracking your costs helps you determine what\u2019s eating away at your profit margin. With this update, we are introducing the much-anticipated retrospective cost linking option, so you can track and manage project-related costs at the most granular level. In addition, we\u2019ve improved Scoro\u2019s export options and polished up a few things on the task management side. \nSee what we\u2019ve been up to!\nCost tracking\nYou can use the \nQuoted vs Actual table\n to keep a close eye on your project budget and profitability. Now it is much easier to \nlink cost documents with quote lines\n retrospectively to maintain an up-to-date overview of project-related costs in the Quoted vs Actual table. \nUse the \nLink to quote\n button in the bill/expense detailed view to open up the linking modal. Then simply \ndrag and drop the lines\n to link them. You can link any bills and expenses that are created from scratch or imported from Xero, Quickbooks or Expensify. \nRead more\n \nSmarter export option\nYou can now pick and choose which data fields you want to export from your detailed work and financial reports. Simply customize your report view with the information you need and \nexport only the visible fields\n. \nRead more\n \nTask planning in Gantt chart\nNow it\u2019s easier to plan tasks with no start and due dates using the \nGantt chart\n. Move your cursor to the relevant task row and place the corresponding task into the desired slot with just a click. \nRead more\n \nGroup tasks by phases\nYou can now group tasks in your \ntask list\n by project phases. This makes it easier to get a phase-based overview of tasks and distinguish between similarly named tasks in different phases of the same project. \nRead more\n \nThat's not all! \nSee our blog post for more details\n.\nWe do our very best to make Scoro better every day, so we really appreciate your feedback.

    "body": "Hi Karen \u2013\nHappiest Friday!!\n\u00a0\nBased on our conversation a few weeks back and the three needs listed below (I added a 4\nth\n need, based on our conversation), here are my responses/proposal:\n\u00a0\nIntro to MUB\n:\n\u00a0\nWe are interested in seeing the revised e-learning as we are still using the original elearning for all new hires.\nThe revised version will look similar to the screenshots I shared below. The narration script and onscreen treatments are being outlined and reviewed currently. The newly updated version of IMUB will have a lot of the same content and in a similar flow of content, but with fresher \nWhat Would You Do\n quiz questions and \nCustomer Connections\n. This refresh will be available in late October/early November with a subscription model format. \nThis course will also be used in many of our \nlearning path experiences\n (ways to get learners to deep dive into more concepts that are theme based and have more than one online learning). A subscription model will be used for the distribution of those experiences as well. The costs will range either by number of seats, monthly packages, or an annual membership.\u00a0 \nThe 3-hour workshop we have is \u201c\nMUB in the Workplace\n\u201d \u2013 I\u2019m not sure of the replacement, if any\nCurrently there is no replacement of this and as you previously stated, the content needs a refresh, and suggested a hybrid approach. This is a good idea and one we will be exploring in a future build complete with online videos, supplemental activities (collaboration), and a check-in with a facilitator. This idea and outline have been pitched to the content team and awaiting a review. If you are interested in pursuing this, perhaps we can partner in the build and use your organization to pilot the approach.\u00a0\u00a0 \n\u00a0\nVery interested in the \nsubscription model pricing\nThe final pricing of the LMS has not been finalized but will be by 8/31. We are looking to presell annual memberships to the LMS; which includes a learning path experience (1-2 online learnings, 1-2 microlearnings, quarterly DEI articles, and free facilitated spotlight learnings for some heritage/celebration months/themes). The idea is to work with companies to deliver solutions and behavior changing experiences\u2026not just courses. The LMS offering is away to allow clients to customize their learning paths rather than customized content. If interested, I\u2019m happy to set up a meeting to provide you more information.\n\u00a0\nDEI Audit\n\u00a0\nYou mentioned starting at ground zero with your DEIB learning needs\u2026interestingly, many of our clients are starting to feel this way as they dig deeper into wanting more than IMUB. They feel as if they have done so many things in the way of DEIB that they need a plan, a path, a way to start moving the needle in behaviors and data. Our DEI audit takes a deep-dive analysis to identify where unconscious bias may exist in processes, projects, and practices across the organization. LCW will then work with SBD to outline a range of de-biasing solutions and create a plan for implementation, including action steps, ERG integration, talent management strategies (or other departmental strategies), and DEIB learnings. I\u2019m happy to share a sample plan of a recent audit. \u00a0\n\u00a0\nPlease let me know if you have any follow-up questions. I can arrange a demo of each if you like\u2014please advise!\n\u00a0\n-\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nKELLY SALEK\nDirector of Instructional Design\nLCW \n100 S Saunders Rd, Suite 150\nLake Forest, IL 60045\n\u00a0 \n\u00a0\n \nDirect: +1.630.234.7807\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \n\u00a0\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\nwww\n\u00a0\n|\n\u00a0\nTwitter\n \n|\n\u00a0\nFacebook\n\u00a0\n|\n\u00a0\nLinkedIn\n\u00a0\n \n\u00a0\nTo inspire kindness, deepen\u00a0understanding, and\nfoster equity in\u00a0the communities\u00a0where people\nlive\u00a0and at the organizations where they\u00a0work.\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\nFrom:\n Rubano, Karen <Karen.Rubano@sbdinc.com> \nSent:\n Wednesday, August 17, 2022 8:58 AM\nTo:\n Kelly Salek <k.salek@lcwmail.com>; Tahitia Timmons <t.timmons@lcwmail.com>\nCc:\n Conner Williams <c.williams@lcwmail.com>\nSubject:\n RE: Hello from Stanley Black & Decker - Unconscious Bias\n\u00a0\nHello!\u00a0 Kelly \u2013 TY for taking the time to map out the plans.\u00a0 In summary, for Stanley Black & Decker purposes:\n\u00a0\nIntro to MUB:\u00a0 we are interested in seeing the revised e-learning as we are still using the original elearning for all new hires.\nThe 3 hour workshop we have is \u201cMUB in the Workplace\u201d \u2013 I\u2019m not sure of the replacement, if any\nVery interested in the subscription model pricing\n\u00a0\nAs far as the \u201cpilot\u201d which was brought to the table, I am not sure where that fits in all this.\u00a0 We are truly starting from scratch.\u00a0 Please stay in touch with your progress on the above!\n\u00a0\nKaren Rubano\u00a0 \n\u00a0\nGlobal Diversity, Equity and Inclusion Center of Excellence\nStanley Black & Decker\n860-304-1228\n\u00a0\nwww.stanleyblackanddecker.com\nhttps://www.stanleyblackanddecker.com/careers/working-here\nhttps://www.stanleyblackanddecker.com/who-we-are/our-culture\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\nFrom:\n Kelly Salek <\nk.salek@lcwmail.com\n> \nSent:\n Wednesday, August 17, 2022 12:27 AM\nTo:\n Rubano, Karen <\nKaren.Rubano@sbdinc.com\n>; Tahitia Timmons <\nt.timmons@lcwmail.com\n>\nCc:\n Conner Williams <\nc.williams@lcwmail.com\n>\nSubject:\n RE: Hello from Stanley Black & Decker - Unconscious Bias\n\u00a0\n***CAUTION: EXTERNAL MESSAGE***\n\u00a0\nKaren & Tahitia \u2013 \nThank you for all the clarification below\u2026I am happy to step in a share a few insights from the Product, Design, and Development department at LCW.\n\u00a0\nCurrently, we are revamping the look and feel of our online learnings, including the \nIntroduction to Managing Unconscious Bias\n and accompanying microlearnings on \nManaging Bias in Performance Reviews\n and \nTalent Reviews\n (see table below for full list). The content for all the learnings is in the process of being reviewed and undergoing a research analysis (determining the relevancy and accuracy of the research documentation\u2026some historical documentation is still quite relevant).\u00a0 \n\u00a0\nAdditionally, we have been working on a follow-up to the \nIntroduction to Managing Unconscious Bias \nthat takes the information to the next level, integrating \nhabits for practicing conscious inclusion\n and the power of neuroplasticity (\nneuroplasticity shapes our processes of behavioral change\n). This is like a 201 course on managing bias (see new build below)\u2014Conscious Inclusion. \n\u00a0\nMaintenance Schedule\nCourse\nTime\nEst. Delivery Date\nIntroduction to Managing Unconscious Bias\n20-30 Mins\nMid/End October\nManaging Bias in Talent Review\n10 Mins\nOctober\nManaging Bias in Performance Reviews\n10 Mins\nOctober\nConscious Inclusion **\nNEW BUILD\n \u2013 See concepts below**\n20-30 Mins\nEarly/Mid November\nHiring & Promoting Top Talent\n20 Mins\nNovember\nHiring & Promoting Top Talent (Microlearning Series)\n10 Min Each (x3)\nNovember\nCulture & Identity\n20-30 Mins\nDecember\n\u00a0\nHere are the storyboard concepts. During design and development, often we include organizations that want this type of learning to be included in the design process/content review and piloting\u2026of course this includes a price break. For more information, let me know, we can organize a meeting to better align on the cost and process for how this works. Conner Williams is our resident expert in our new course design/development company integrations (cc\u2019d here) as well as our bundled Learning path packages.\u00a0 \n\u00a0\n\u00a0\nLastly, you asked about LCWs Learning platform. We have heard that although there is still a need for one-off purchasing of courses, companies are in need of learning experiences, something that continues and reinforces the need for DEIB experiential learning.

Any chance that could work for your team? \n\u00a0\nIf not, it\u2019d be great if you can share a few other options, and I can work with the team to see what is flexible. Heads up, I\u2019m out the whole week of 9/19 traveling for work, so my availability that week is pretty limited. \n\u00a0\nI\u2019m hoping to get this scheduled ASAP because schedules are already looking challenging, and I know Adrianne, J.J. and Lisa are all eager to get something on the books to hear about next steps. Please let me know when you get a chance. \n\u00a0\nAlso, I\u2019m sharing a short presentation that our team recently pulled together. They had a series of conversations with GMs about this year\u2019s DE&I survey results, and this deck highlights their findings. This presentation has gotten some attention internally, so I wanted to pass along. \n\u00a0\nThanks!\nRachel \n\u00a0\n\u00a0\nFrom:\n Tamara Thorpe <t.thorpe@lcwmail.com> \nSent:\n Thursday, August 11, 2022 10:36 AM\nTo:\n Rachel Coleman (FleishmanHillard) <Rachel.Coleman@fleishman.com>; Daniel Gough <d.gough@lcwmail.com>; Vince Bongiovanni <v.bongiovanni@lcwmail.com>; Tahitia Timmons <t.timmons@lcwmail.com>\nCc:\n Adrianne Smith (FleishmanHillard) <adrianne.smith@fleishman.com>\nSubject:\n RE: Our call today\n\u00a0\nHello Rachel,\n\u00a0\nI\u2019d suggest an hour for the readouts.\n\u00a0\nTamara\n\u00a0\nFrom:\n Rachel Coleman (FleishmanHillard) <\nRachel.Coleman@fleishman.com\n> \nSent:\n Thursday, August 11, 2022 9:11 AM\nTo:\n Tamara Thorpe <\nt.thorpe@lcwmail.com\n>; Daniel Gough <\nd.gough@lcwmail.com\n>; Vince Bongiovanni <\nv.bongiovanni@lcwmail.com\n>; Tahitia Timmons <\nt.timmons@lcwmail.com\n>\nCc:\n Adrianne Smith (FleishmanHillard) <\nadrianne.smith@fleishman.com\n>\nSubject:\n RE: Our call today\n\u00a0\nThanks, Tamara.

Do you have a date in mind that you\u2019d like to regroup? Or should we circle back on that once we have the last two stakeholder interviews scheduled? Also, Adrianne and I talked about the initial readout, and that will likely be Adrianne, Lisa, J.J. and myself. I know we still have some time, but let us know when we should start looking at dates for that. There might be one or two other groups that we want to review the findings, but we can decide on that as we get closer. \n\u00a0\nOne small request from me. I have a call with one of our APAC DE&I leaders and she was wondering how the APAC focus groups went. Could the team send just a few sentences that I could have on hand to send to her? My call with her is Monday evening. LMK if that works. \n\u00a0\nThanks, \nRachel \u00a0\n\u00a0\nFrom:\n Tamara Thorpe <\nt.thorpe@lcwmail.com\n> \nSent:\n Thursday, August 4, 2022 12:03 PM\nTo:\n Rachel Coleman (FleishmanHillard) <\nRachel.Coleman@fleishman.com\n>; Daniel Gough <\nd.gough@lcwmail.com\n>; Vince Bongiovanni <\nv.bongiovanni@lcwmail.com\n>; Tahitia Timmons <\nt.timmons@lcwmail.com\n>\nCc:\n Adrianne Smith (FleishmanHillard) <\nadrianne.smith@fleishman.com\n>\nSubject:\n RE: Our call today\n\u00a0\nHello Rachel,\n\u00a0\nLast weeks interview went great! We are looking forward to the last 3; we know Vince has gotten dates out to you so we look forward to connecting with those leaders. Given that there is a lot of data for us to sort through already, I\u2019d like to suggest we hold off on our weekly meetings until all of the interviews are complete. This will allow our team to repurpose the time for data review and analysis.\n\u00a0\nLet me know if that works for you and your team, or if you prefer to have a touch base in the interim.\n\u00a0\nAll the best,\nTamara\n\u00a0\nFrom:\n Rachel Coleman (FleishmanHillard) <\nRachel.Coleman@fleishman.com\n> \nSent:\n Thursday, July 28, 2022 9:11 AM\nTo:\n Tamara Thorpe <\nt.thorpe@lcwmail.com\n>; Daniel Gough <\nd.gough@lcwmail.com\n>; Vince Bongiovanni <\nv.bongiovanni@lcwmail.com\n>; Tahitia Timmons <\nt.timmons@lcwmail.com\n>\nCc:\n Adrianne Smith (FleishmanHillard) <\nadrianne.smith@fleishman.com\n>\nSubject:\n RE: Our call today\n\u00a0\nHi Tamara and team, \n\u00a0\nThanks for the update!

At this point Thursday, 7/7: 11am-12pm CT is probably the best option so let me know if I should look at the second/third weeks of July too. \n1:1 Stakeholder Interviews\nScheduling\n: LCW working on time blocks. I also have a meeting with Lisa Moehlenkamp tomorrow to give her a heads up that we\u2019re starting to schedule. \nQuestions:\n FH/LCW to finalize questions. \nI know your team is working on those based on our conversation last week. \nTo Adrianne\u2019s point on the call, we think there are three \u201cthemes\u201d to these conversations: Personal commitment, accountability (for themselves and others) and I also think hearing their perspective on existing barriers or challenges that make it harder for them or their teams to make inclusion a priority, such as business demands from the firm. \nAlso, if there are any other themes that have emerged from the focus groups that we want to ask about, such as the point that Dan brought up about utilization, that is great too. \nI also gave this some thought so sharing some ideas below. \nWhat personal goals/commitments have you made as it relates to DE&I? Can you share an example of actions that have supported those commitments?\nAs a leader, how are you holding yourself accountable? How do you hold other leaders and managers on your team accountable?\nWhere does DE&I fit in with your other business priorities?\nWould love thoughts on this one. I think it\u2019s easy to say that DE&I is a priority but actually practicing that is more difficult. I think our focus on utilization is a great example. So I want to ask a question that digs into what DE&I being a priority looks like \nin action\n for these leaders beyond just\u00a0 \u201cvoicing support.\u201d \nFrom the GM deck: Which processes or policies limit or enhance a culture of inclusion and sense of belonging at FleishmanHillard? What is working or not working?\nDE&I Certification Exploratory Conversation: Confirmed for 6/30\n\u00a0\nLMK if there is anything I missed. \n\u00a0\nThanks!\nRachel \n\u00a0\nRachel Coleman (She/Her)\nVice President \n|\n \nReputation \nFleishmanHillard\n \n|\n \n225 N.

The content for all the learnings is in the process of being reviewed and undergoing a research analysis (determining the relevancy and accuracy of the research documentation\u2026some historical documentation is still quite relevant).\u00a0 \n\u00a0\nAdditionally, we have been working on a follow-up to the \nIntroduction to Managing Unconscious Bias \nthat takes the information to the next level, integrating \nhabits for practicing conscious inclusion\n and the power of neuroplasticity (\nneuroplasticity shapes our processes of behavioral change\n). This is like a 201 course on managing bias (see new build below)\u2014Conscious Inclusion. \n\u00a0\nMaintenance Schedule\nCourse\nTime\nEst.

During design and development, often we include organizations that want this type of learning to be included in the design process/content review and piloting\u2026of course this includes a price break. For more information, let me know, we can organize a meeting to better align on the cost and process for how this works. Conner Williams is our resident expert in our new course design/development company integrations (cc\u2019d here) as well as our bundled Learning path packages.\u00a0 \n\u00a0\n\u00a0\nLastly, you asked about LCWs Learning platform. We have heard that although there is still a need for one-off purchasing of courses, companies are in need of learning experiences, something that continues and reinforces the need for DEIB experiential learning. With that in mind, we will be offering Learning Path Experiences that provide organizations with learning opportunities that can be used all year long\u2026this might include 1-2 online learning courses, 1-2 microlearnings, articles and trends, and inclusion tips. All these things would be available through a subscription-based model using a cloud-based platform. The product is still in review and aims to be released in November\u2026I\u2019ll have the subscription model pricing done in two weeks.\u00a0\u00a0 \n\u00a0\nI am happy to share more about any of the individual projects mentioned above and walk-through the process of being a part of the development of content and/or a pilot [company] participant for the learning platform. \nBest!!!\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n-\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nKELLY SALEK\nDirector of Instructional Design\nLCW \n100 S Saunders Rd, Suite 150\nLake Forest, IL 60045\n\u00a0 \n\u00a0\n \nDirect: +1.630.234.7807\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \n\u00a0\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\nwww\n\u00a0\n|\n\u00a0\nTwitter\n \n|\n\u00a0\nFacebook\n\u00a0\n|\n\u00a0\nLinkedIn\n\u00a0\n \n\u00a0\nTo inspire kindness, deepen\u00a0understanding, and\nfoster equity in\u00a0the communities\u00a0where people\nlive\u00a0and at the organizations where they\u00a0work.\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\nFrom:\n Rubano, Karen <\nKaren.Rubano@sbdinc.com\n> \nSent:\n Tuesday, August 16, 2022 6:53 AM\nTo:\n Tahitia Timmons <\nt.timmons@lcwmail.com\n>; Kelly Salek <\nk.salek@lcwmail.com\n>\nSubject:\n RE: Hello from Stanley Black & Decker - Unconscious Bias\n\u00a0\nHi!\n\u00a0\nI am referring to the 30 minute Introduction to MUB \u2013 the elearning/video for which we just provided Compliance the script.\u00a0 See attached.\u00a0 My question \u2013 is this also undergoing an update, and if yes, the timeframe?\u00a0 TY!\n\u00a0\nI want to make sure we are on the same page.\u00a0 We discussed a pilot proposal based on LCW\u2019s new content and learning platform.\u00a0 We are interested in what that pilot would look like and cost.\u00a0I don\u2019t want to lose sight of that.\u00a0 The proposal should be associated with the new content and look.\u00a0 \n\u00a0\nKaren\n\u00a0\nKaren Rubano\u00a0 \n\u00a0\nGlobal Diversity, Equity and Inclusion Center of Excellence\nStanley Black & Decker\n860-304-1228\n\u00a0\nwww.stanleyblackanddecker.com\nhttps://www.stanleyblackanddecker.com/careers/working-here\nhttps://www.stanleyblackanddecker.com/who-we-are/our-culture\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\nFrom:\n Tahitia Timmons <\nt.timmons@lcwmail.com\n> \nSent:\n Tuesday, August 16, 2022 6:31 AM\nTo:\n Rubano, Karen <\nKaren.Rubano@sbdinc.com\n>; Kelly Salek <\nk.salek@lcwmail.com\n>\nSubject:\n RE: Hello from Stanley Black & Decker - Unconscious Bias\n\u00a0\n***CAUTION: EXTERNAL MESSAGE***\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\nHi Karen,\nSorry,\u00a0Can you clarify what video you are referring to?\nWe can always update client specific content and provide timelines.\nCurrently the MUB (course 101)\u00a0is being updated with the ability to adapt as needed for organization and includes revised\n/new content along with an updated look.

    "body": "Karen & Tahitia \u2013 \nThank you for all the clarification below\u2026I am happy to step in a share a few insights from the Product, Design, and Development department at LCW.\n\u00a0\nCurrently, we are revamping the look and feel of our online learnings, including the \nIntroduction to Managing Unconscious Bias\n and accompanying microlearnings on \nManaging Bias in Performance Reviews\n and \nTalent Reviews\n (see table below for full list). The content for all the learnings is in the process of being reviewed and undergoing a research analysis (determining the relevancy and accuracy of the research documentation\u2026some historical documentation is still quite relevant).\u00a0 \n\u00a0\nAdditionally, we have been working on a follow-up to the \nIntroduction to Managing Unconscious Bias \nthat takes the information to the next level, integrating \nhabits for practicing conscious inclusion\n and the power of neuroplasticity (\nneuroplasticity shapes our processes of behavioral change\n). This is like a 201 course on managing bias (see new build below)\u2014Conscious Inclusion. \n\u00a0\nMaintenance Schedule\nCourse\nTime\nEst. Delivery Date\nIntroduction to Managing Unconscious Bias\n20-30 Mins\nMid/End October\nManaging Bias in Talent Review\n10 Mins\nOctober\nManaging Bias in Performance Reviews\n10 Mins\nOctober\nConscious Inclusion **\nNEW BUILD\n \u2013 See concepts below**\n20-30 Mins\nEarly/Mid November\nHiring & Promoting Top Talent\n20 Mins\nNovember\nHiring & Promoting Top Talent (Microlearning Series)\n10 Min Each (x3)\nNovember\nCulture & Identity\n20-30 Mins\nDecember\n\u00a0\nHere are the storyboard concepts. During design and development, often we include organizations that want this type of learning to be included in the design process/content review and piloting\u2026of course this includes a price break. For more information, let me know, we can organize a meeting to better align on the cost and process for how this works. Conner Williams is our resident expert in our new course design/development company integrations (cc\u2019d here) as well as our bundled Learning path packages.\u00a0 \n\u00a0\n\u00a0\nLastly, you asked about LCWs Learning platform. We have heard that although there is still a need for one-off purchasing of courses, companies are in need of learning experiences, something that continues and reinforces the need for DEIB experiential learning. With that in mind, we will be offering Learning Path Experiences that provide organizations with learning opportunities that can be used all year long\u2026this might include 1-2 online learning courses, 1-2 microlearnings, articles and trends, and inclusion tips. All these things would be available through a subscription-based model using a cloud-based platform. The product is still in review and aims to be released in November\u2026I\u2019ll have the subscription model pricing done in two weeks.\u00a0\u00a0 \n\u00a0\nI am happy to share more about any of the individual projects mentioned above and walk-through the process of being a part of the development of content and/or a pilot [company] participant for the learning platform. \nBest!!!\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n-\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nKELLY SALEK\nDirector of Instructional Design\nLCW \n100 S Saunders Rd, Suite 150\nLake Forest, IL 60045\n\u00a0 \n\u00a0\n \nDirect: +1.630.234.7807\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \n\u00a0\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\nwww\n\u00a0\n|\n\u00a0\nTwitter\n \n|\n\u00a0\nFacebook\n\u00a0\n|\n\u00a0\nLinkedIn\n\u00a0\n \n\u00a0\nTo inspire kindness, deepen\u00a0understanding, and\nfoster equity in\u00a0the communities\u00a0where people\nlive\u00a0and at the organizations where they\u00a0work.\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\nFrom:\n Rubano, Karen <Karen.Rubano@sbdinc.com> \nSent:\n Tuesday, August 16, 2022 6:53 AM\nTo:\n Tahitia Timmons <t.timmons@lcwmail.com>; Kelly Salek <k.salek@lcwmail.com>\nSubject:\n RE: Hello from Stanley Black & Decker - Unconscious Bias\n\u00a0\nHi!\n\u00a0\nI am referring to the 30 minute Introduction to MUB \u2013 the elearning/video for which we just provided Compliance the script.\u00a0 See attached.\u00a0 My question \u2013 is this also undergoing an update, and if yes, the timeframe?\u00a0 TY!\n\u00a0\nI want to make sure we are on the same page.\u00a0 We discussed a pilot proposal based on LCW\u2019s new content and learning platform.\u00a0 We are interested in what that pilot would look like and cost.\u00a0I don\u2019t want to lose sight of that.\u00a0 The proposal should be associated with the new content and look.\u00a0 \n\u00a0\nKaren\n\u00a0\nKaren Rubano\u00a0 \n\u00a0\nGlobal Diversity, Equity and Inclusion Center of Excellence\nStanley Black & Decker\n860-304-1228\n\u00a0\nwww.stanleyblackanddecker.com\nhttps://www.stanleyblackanddecker.com/careers/working-here\nhttps://www.stanleyblackanddecker.com/who-we-are/our-culture\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\nFrom:\n Tahitia Timmons <\nt.timmons@lcwmail.com\n> \nSent:\n Tuesday, August 16, 2022 6:31 AM\nTo:\n Rubano, Karen <\nKaren.Rubano@sbdinc.com\n>; Kelly Salek <\nk.salek@lcwmail.com\n>\nSubject:\n RE: Hello from Stanley Black & Decker - Unconscious Bias\n\u00a0\n***CAUTION: EXTERNAL MESSAGE***\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\nHi Karen,\nSorry,\u00a0Can you clarify what video you are referring to?\nWe can always update client specific content and provide timelines.\nCurrently the MUB (course 101)\u00a0is being updated with the ability to adapt as needed for organization and includes revised\n/new content along with an updated look.

    "body": "Karen & Tahitia \u2013 \nThank you for all the clarification below\u2026I am happy to step in a share a few insights from the Product, Design, and Development department at LCW.\n\u00a0\nCurrently, we are revamping the look and feel of our online learnings, including the \nIntroduction to Managing Unconscious Bias\n and accompanying microlearnings on \nManaging Bias in Performance Reviews\n and \nTalent Reviews\n (see table below for full list). The content for all the learnings is in the process of being reviewed and undergoing a research analysis (determining the relevancy and accuracy of the research documentation\u2026some historical documentation is still quite relevant).\u00a0 \n\u00a0\nAdditionally, we have been working on a follow-up to the \nIntroduction to Managing Unconscious Bias \nthat takes the information to the next level, integrating \nhabits for practicing conscious inclusion\n and the power of neuroplasticity (\nneuroplasticity shapes our processes of behavioral change\n). This is like a 201 course on managing bias (see new build below)\u2014Conscious Inclusion. \n\u00a0\nMaintenance Schedule\nCourse\nTime\nEst. Delivery Date\nIntroduction to Managing Unconscious Bias\n20-30 Mins\nMid/End October\nManaging Bias in Talent Review\n10 Mins\nOctober\nManaging Bias in Performance Reviews\n10 Mins\nOctober\nConscious Inclusion **\nNEW BUILD\n \u2013 See concepts below**\n20-30 Mins\nEarly/Mid November\nHiring & Promoting Top Talent\n20 Mins\nNovember\nHiring & Promoting Top Talent (Microlearning Series)\n10 Min Each (x3)\nNovember\nCulture & Identity\n20-30 Mins\nDecember\n\u00a0\nHere are the storyboard concepts. During design and development, often we include organizations that want this type of learning to be included in the design process/content review and piloting\u2026of course this includes a price break. For more information, let me know, we can organize a meeting to better align on the cost and process for how this works. Conner Williams is our resident expert in our new course design/development company integrations (cc\u2019d here).\u00a0 \n\u00a0\n\u00a0\nLastly, you asked about LCWs Learning platform. We have heard that although there is still a need for one-off purchasing of courses, companies are in need of learning experiences, something that continues and reinforces the need for DEIB experiential learning. With that in mind, we will be offering \nLearning Path Experiences\n (see sample image below) that provide organizations with learning opportunities that can be used all year long\u2026this might include 1-2 online learning courses, 1-2 microlearnings, articles and trends, and inclusion tips. All these things would be available through a subscription-based model using a cloud-based platform. The product is still in review and aims to be released in November.\u00a0\u00a0 \n\u00a0\n\u00a0\nI am happy to share more about any of the individual projects mentioned above (updated course, new course build, learning platform) and walk-through the process of being a part of the development of content and/or a pilot [company] participant for the learning platform. This might be just the kind of conversation and plan SBD needs to integrate the learnings from past LCW experiences, new learning opportunities from LCW and your LinkedIn Learning plan. \n\u00a0\nBest!!!\n\u00a0\n-\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nKELLY SALEK\nDirector of Instructional Design\nLCW \n100 S Saunders Rd, Suite 150\nLake Forest, IL 60045\n\u00a0 \n\u00a0\n \nDirect: +1.630.234.7807\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \n\u00a0\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\nwww\n\u00a0\n|\n\u00a0\nTwitter\n \n|\n\u00a0\nFacebook\n\u00a0\n|\n\u00a0\nLinkedIn\n\u00a0\n \n\u00a0\nTo inspire kindness, deepen\u00a0understanding, and\nfoster equity in\u00a0the communities\u00a0where people\nlive\u00a0and at the organizations where they\u00a0work.\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\nFrom:\n Rubano, Karen <Karen.Rubano@sbdinc.com> \nSent:\n Tuesday, August 16, 2022 6:53 AM\nTo:\n Tahitia Timmons <t.timmons@lcwmail.com>; Kelly Salek <k.salek@lcwmail.com>\nSubject:\n RE: Hello from Stanley Black & Decker - Unconscious Bias\n\u00a0\nHi!\n\u00a0\nI am referring to the 30 minute Introduction to MUB \u2013 the elearning/video for which we just provided Compliance the script.\u00a0 See attached.\u00a0 My question \u2013 is this also undergoing an update, and if yes, the timeframe?\u00a0 TY!\n\u00a0\nI want to make sure we are on the same page.\u00a0 We discussed a pilot proposal based on LCW\u2019s new content and learning platform.\u00a0 We are interested in what that pilot would look like and cost.\u00a0I don\u2019t want to lose sight of that.\u00a0 The proposal should be associated with the new content and look.\u00a0 \n\u00a0\nKaren\n\u00a0\nKaren Rubano\u00a0 \n\u00a0\nGlobal Diversity, Equity and Inclusion Center of Excellence\nStanley Black & Decker\n860-304-1228\n\u00a0\nwww.stanleyblackanddecker.com\nhttps://www.stanleyblackanddecker.com/careers/working-here\nhttps://www.stanleyblackanddecker.com/who-we-are/our-culture\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\nFrom:\n Tahitia Timmons <\nt.timmons@lcwmail.com\n> \nSent:\n Tuesday, August 16, 2022 6:31 AM\nTo:\n Rubano, Karen <\nKaren.Rubano@sbdinc.com\n>; Kelly Salek <\nk.salek@lcwmail.com\n>\nSubject:\n RE: Hello from Stanley Black & Decker - Unconscious Bias\n\u00a0\n***CAUTION: EXTERNAL MESSAGE***\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\nHi Karen,\nSorry,\u00a0Can you clarify what video you are referring to?\nWe can always update client specific content and provide timelines.\nCurrently the MUB (course 101)\u00a0is being updated with the ability to adapt as needed for organization and includes revised\n/new content along with an updated look.

The content for all the learnings is in the process of being reviewed and undergoing a research analysis (determining the relevancy and accuracy of the research documentation\u2026some historical documentation is still quite relevant).\u00a0 \n\u00a0\nAdditionally, we have been working on a follow-up to the \nIntroduction to Managing Unconscious Bias \nthat takes the information to the next level, integrating \nhabits for practicing conscious inclusion\n and the power of neuroplasticity (\nneuroplasticity shapes our processes of behavioral change\n). This is like a 201 course on managing bias (see new build below)\u2014Conscious Inclusion. \n\u00a0\nMaintenance Schedule\nCourse\nTime\nEst. Delivery Date\nIntroduction to Managing Unconscious Bias\n20-30 Mins\nMid/End October\nManaging Bias in Talent Review\n10 Mins\nOctober\nManaging Bias in Performance Reviews\n10 Mins\nOctober\nConscious Inclusion **\nNEW BUILD\n \u2013 See concepts below**\n20-30 Mins\nEarly/Mid November\nHiring & Promoting Top Talent\n20 Mins\nNovember\nHiring & Promoting Top Talent (Microlearning Series)\n10 Min Each (x3)\nNovember\nCulture & Identity\n20-30 Mins\nDecember\n\u00a0\nHere are the storyboard concepts. During design and development, often we include organizations that want this type of learning to be included in the design process/content review and piloting\u2026of course this includes a price break. For more information, let me know, we can organize a meeting to better align on the cost and process for how this works. Conner Williams is our resident expert in our new course design/development company integrations (cc\u2019d here).\u00a0 \n\u00a0\n\u00a0\nLastly, you asked about LCWs Learning platform. We have heard that although there is still a need for one-off purchasing of courses, companies are in need of learning experiences, something that continues and reinforces the need for DEIB experiential learning. With that in mind, we will be offering \nLearning Path Experiences\n (see sample image below) that provide organizations with learning opportunities that can be used all year long\u2026this might include 1-2 online learning courses, 1-2 microlearnings, articles and trends, and inclusion tips. All these things would be available through a subscription-based model using a cloud-based platform. The product is still in review and aims to be released in November.\u00a0\u00a0 \n\u00a0\n\u00a0\nI am happy to share more about any of the individual projects mentioned above (updated course, new course build, learning platform) and walk-through the process of being a part of the development of content and/or a pilot [company] participant for the learning platform. This might be just the kind of conversation and plan SBD needs to integrate the learnings from past LCW experiences, new learning opportunities from LCW and your LinkedIn Learning plan. \n\u00a0\nBest!!!\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\nFrom:\n Tahitia Timmons <\nt.timmons@lcwmail.com\n> \nSent:\n Tuesday, August 16, 2022 5:31 AM\nTo:\n Rubano, Karen <\nKaren.Rubano@sbdinc.com\n>; Kelly Salek <\nk.salek@lcwmail.com\n>\nSubject:\n RE: Hello from Stanley Black & Decker - Unconscious Bias\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\nHi Karen,\nSorry,\u00a0Can you clarify what video you are referring to?\nWe can always update client specific content and provide timelines.\nCurrently the MUB (course 101)\u00a0is being updated with the ability to adapt as needed for organization and includes revised\n/new content along with an updated look.

Yet, many organizations\u00a0do not consider this important\u00a0part of workers\u2019 identities outside the Christian faith. In practicing cultural competency, it is crucial that organizations move beyond religious tolerance and toward inclusion\u00ad\u00ad\u2014especially for non-Christian faiths and non-faiths\u2014to ensure equitable policies for their diverse communities.\nIn this conversation, Culture Moments host Larry Baker (he/him) and DEI consultant Rahimeh Ramizany (she/her) delve into the complexities of faith in the workplace, drawing on Rahimeh\u2019s experience as a consultant, speaker, DEI expert, and multiethnic, neurodiverse, visibly Muslim American woman.\nPlease use the button above to register for this complimentary live stream.

    "body": "THIS IS GOING TO BE MY RESPONSE\u2026OK\u2026thoughts?\n\u00a0\nKaren & Tahitia \u2013 \nThank you for all the clarification below\u2026I am happy to step in a share a few insights from the Product, Design, and Development department at LCW.\n\u00a0\nCurrently, we are revamping the look and feel of our online learnings, including the \nIntroduction to Managing Unconscious Bias\n and accompanying microlearnings on \nManaging Bias in Performance Reviews\n and \nTalent Reviews\n (see table below for full list). The content for all the learnings is in the process of being reviewed and undergoing a research analysis (determining the relevancy and accuracy of the research documentation\u2026some historical documentation is still quite relevant).\u00a0 \n\u00a0\nAdditionally, we have been working on a follow-up to the \nIntroduction to Managing Unconscious Bias \nthat takes the information to the next level, integrating \nhabits for practicing conscious inclusion\n and the power of neuroplasticity (\nneuroplasticity shapes our processes of behavioral change\n). This is like a 201 course on managing bias (see new build below)\u2014Conscious Inclusion. \n\u00a0\nMaintenance Schedule\nCourse\nTime\nEst. Delivery Date\nIntroduction to Managing Unconscious Bias\n20-30 Mins\nMid/End October\nManaging Bias in Talent Review\n10 Mins\nOctober\nManaging Bias in Performance Reviews\n10 Mins\nOctober\nConscious Inclusion **\nNEW BUILD\n \u2013 See concepts below**\n20-30 Mins\nEarly/Mid November\nHiring & Promoting Top Talent\n20 Mins\nNovember\nHiring & Promoting Top Talent (Microlearning Series)\n10 Min Each (x3)\nNovember\nCulture & Identity\n20-30 Mins\nDecember\n\u00a0\nHere are the storyboard concepts. During design and development, often we include organizations that want this type of learning to be included in the design process/content review and piloting\u2026of course this includes a price break. For more information, let me know, we can organize a meeting to better align on the cost and process for how this works. Conner Williams is our resident expert in our new course design/development company integrations (cc\u2019d here).\u00a0 \n\u00a0\n\u00a0\nLastly, you asked about LCWs Learning platform. We have heard that although there is still a need for one-off purchasing of courses, companies are in need of learning experiences, something that continues and reinforces the need for DEIB experiential learning. With that in mind, we will be offering \nLearning Path Experiences\n (see sample image below) that provide organizations with learning opportunities that can be used all year long\u2026this might include 1-2 online learning courses, 1-2 microlearnings, articles and trends, and inclusion tips. All these things would be available through a subscription-based model using a cloud-based platform. The product is still in review and aims to be released in November.\u00a0\u00a0 \n\u00a0\n\u00a0\nI am happy to share more about any of the individual projects mentioned above (updated course, new course build, learning platform) and walk-through the process of being a part of the development of content and/or a pilot [company] participant for the learning platform. This might be just the kind of conversation and plan SBD needs to integrate the learnings from past LCW experiences, new learning opportunities from LCW and your LinkedIn Learning plan. \n\u00a0\nBest!!!\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\nFrom:\n Tahitia Timmons <t.timmons@lcwmail.com> \nSent:\n Tuesday, August 16, 2022 5:31 AM\nTo:\n Rubano, Karen <Karen.Rubano@sbdinc.com>; Kelly Salek <k.salek@lcwmail.com>\nSubject:\n RE: Hello from Stanley Black & Decker - Unconscious Bias\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\nHi Karen,\nSorry,\u00a0Can you clarify what video you are referring to?\nWe can always update client specific content and provide timelines.\nCurrently the MUB (course 101)\u00a0is being updated with the ability to adapt as needed for organization and includes revised\n/new content along with an updated look.

Of course \u2013 eventually a gorgeous formatting job from Keri/Kelly will also be needed. \n\ud83d\ude0a\n\u00a0\nBut for now\u2026 as a first step\u2026\n\u00a0\nSince each of you has expressed interest in seeing what journey maps aligned to the SCI model and Inclusive Leadership might look like\u2013I\u2019d love your thoughts on the attached. It is by no means PRETTY (at all) \u2013 but note I focused on:\ncolor-coding the Inclusive Leadership Competency Framework to align with the already agreed upon graphic for the \u201cSustainable Culture of Inclusion Model\u201d\ncreating distinct inclusive leadership learning journeys for 3 groups: \nAll audiences including individual contributors \nSenior leaders\nMiddle managers\n\u00a0\nTahitia, Andrea, Sarah, Dan and Tamara\n \u2013 I\u2019d love you to see if you like the courses listed under each, and what you might change.\n\u00a0\nChuck, Alisa, Kell, Nicole and Melissa\n \u2013 I\u2019d welcome your thoughts on the overall concepts here, knowing that I\u2019ve tried to capture my expertise and experience for you in a transferrable way.\n\u00a0\nIf we are headed in the right direction \u2013 I will format the \u201cBias Learning Journeys\u201d attached. For now I\u2019ve just documented the courses, trying to minimize (but not necessarily completely eliminate) redundancy with the Inclusive Leadership Journeys so that you can sell both to a given client. \n\u00a0\nI\u2019ll set up time to talk through these with some of you next week. \n\u00a0\n\u00a0\nThank you \n\ud83d\ude0a\nM",

Yet for best effects, employers need to make sure they define it thoughtfully and differentiate it from other important practices, including mentoring, training, and therapy. What is the essence of the collaborative relationship between the coach and the employee? How can the relationship keep focused on building momentum and moving forward?

At this point Thursday, 7/7: 11am-12pm CT is probably the best option so let me know if I should look at the second/third weeks of July too. \n1:1 Stakeholder Interviews\nScheduling\n: LCW working on time blocks. I also have a meeting with Lisa Moehlenkamp tomorrow to give her a heads up that we\u2019re starting to schedule. \nQuestions:\n FH/LCW to finalize questions. \nI know your team is working on those based on our conversation last week. \nTo Adrianne\u2019s point on the call, we think there are three \u201cthemes\u201d to these conversations: Personal commitment, accountability (for themselves and others) and I also think hearing their perspective on existing barriers or challenges that make it harder for them or their teams to make inclusion a priority, such as business demands from the firm. \nAlso, if there are any other themes that have emerged from the focus groups that we want to ask about, such as the point that Dan brought up about utilization, that is great too. \nI also gave this some thought so sharing some ideas below. \nWhat personal goals/commitments have you made as it relates to DE&I? Can you share an example of actions that have supported those commitments?\nAs a leader, how are you holding yourself accountable? How do you hold other leaders and managers on your team accountable?\nWhere does DE&I fit in with your other business priorities?\nWould love thoughts on this one. I think it\u2019s easy to say that DE&I is a priority but actually practicing that is more difficult. I think our focus on utilization is a great example. So I want to ask a question that digs into what DE&I being a priority looks like \nin action\n for these leaders beyond just\u00a0 \u201cvoicing support.\u201d \nFrom the GM deck: Which processes or policies limit or enhance a culture of inclusion and sense of belonging at FleishmanHillard? What is working or not working?\nDE&I Certification Exploratory Conversation: Confirmed for 6/30\n\u00a0\nLMK if there is anything I missed. \n\u00a0\nThanks!\nRachel \n\u00a0\nRachel Coleman (She/Her)\nVice President \n|\n \nReputation \nFleishmanHillard\n \n|\n \n225 N.

At this point Thursday, 7/7: 11am-12pm CT is probably the best option so let me know if I should look at the second/third weeks of July too. \n1:1 Stakeholder Interviews\nScheduling\n: LCW working on time blocks. I also have a meeting with Lisa Moehlenkamp tomorrow to give her a heads up that we\u2019re starting to schedule. \nQuestions:\n FH/LCW to finalize questions. \nI know your team is working on those based on our conversation last week. \nTo Adrianne\u2019s point on the call, we think there are three \u201cthemes\u201d to these conversations: Personal commitment, accountability (for themselves and others) and I also think hearing their perspective on existing barriers or challenges that make it harder for them or their teams to make inclusion a priority, such as business demands from the firm. \nAlso, if there are any other themes that have emerged from the focus groups that we want to ask about, such as the point that Dan brought up about utilization, that is great too. \nI also gave this some thought so sharing some ideas below. \nWhat personal goals/commitments have you made as it relates to DE&I? Can you share an example of actions that have supported those commitments?\nAs a leader, how are you holding yourself accountable? How do you hold other leaders and managers on your team accountable?\nWhere does DE&I fit in with your other business priorities?\nWould love thoughts on this one. I think it\u2019s easy to say that DE&I is a priority but actually practicing that is more difficult. I think our focus on utilization is a great example. So I want to ask a question that digs into what DE&I being a priority looks like \nin action\n for these leaders beyond just\u00a0 \u201cvoicing support.\u201d \nFrom the GM deck: Which processes or policies limit or enhance a culture of inclusion and sense of belonging at FleishmanHillard? What is working or not working?\nDE&I Certification Exploratory Conversation: Confirmed for 6/30\n\u00a0\nLMK if there is anything I missed. \n\u00a0\nThanks!\nRachel \n\u00a0\nRachel Coleman (She/Her)\nVice President \n|\n \nReputation \nFleishmanHillard\n \n|\n \n225 N.

I\u2019ve put some thoughts and notes in the attached, in case helpful, but I love how you\u2019ve set it up. Agree with keeping 5, this is for me the most important part of these documents (clearly I\u2019m a visual learner \n\ud83d\ude0a\n) but also I find the process view to be so useful for accountability.

That said 508 compliance with AA or AAA is often the goal for all industries since it allows you to be a third-party vendor to organizations that require it. \nI go to these sites when I need to look for resources around 508 compliance and Web content Accessibility Guidelines( from W3C) and the new rulings.\nSection 508 site \nhttps://www.section508.gov/\nWorld Wide Web Consortium (the governing body for the web) \nhttps://www.w3.org/\n \nWeb Content Accessibility Guidelines (WCAG) 2.0\u00a0 \nhttp://www.w3.org/TR/WCAG20/\n\u00a0\nThanks hope this is helpful\nTahitia\n------------------------------------------------------\nTahitia Timmons\n(she/her/hers)\nSenior Consultant\nLCW \n100 S Saunders Rd, Suite 150\nLake Forest, IL 60045\n\u00a0 \n\u00a0\n \n\u00a0\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\nwww\n\u00a0\n|\n\u00a0\nTwitter\n \n|\n\u00a0\nFacebook\n\u00a0\n|\n\u00a0\nLinkedIn",

That said 508 compliance with AA or AAA is often the goal for all industries since it allows you to be a third-party vendor to organizations that require it. \nI go to these sites when I need to look for resources around 508 compliance and Web content Accessibility Guidelines( from W3C) and the new rulings.\nSection 508 site \nhttps://www.section508.gov/\nWorld Wide Web Consortium (the governing body for the web) \nhttps://www.w3.org/\n \nWeb Content Accessibility Guidelines (WCAG) 2.0\u00a0 \nhttp://www.w3.org/TR/WCAG20/\n\u00a0\nThanks hope this is helpful\nTahitia\n------------------------------------------------------\nTahitia Timmons\n(she/her/hers)\nSenior Consultant\nLCW \n100 S Saunders Rd, Suite 150\nLake Forest, IL 60045\n\u00a0 \n\u00a0\n \n\u00a0\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\nwww\n\u00a0\n|\n\u00a0\nTwitter\n \n|\n\u00a0\nFacebook\n\u00a0\n|\n\u00a0\nLinkedIn",

Love the colors, the buckets, the emerging sense of the journey, the foregrounding of inclusive leadership\nI am evaluating these through the lens of how I will talk to a client about these journeys, especially in the context of a 30-45-minute meeting, where clients want to know\nWhat are the skills their leaders need (i.e., the 4 inclusive leader competencies)\nWhat are the content areas they need to engage (e.g., unconscious bias, microaggressions, inclusion)\nI have mocked up a few slides (attached) to place between the SCI and the detailed slides that more succinctly communicate what we are trying to do\u2014many of the more detailed slides are great as backup/appendix slides, as well for upskilling our consultants, but too much information for our clients to digest at first \nSimilarly, the hierarchy-specific journeys are great and useful for similar reasons, but too much information for clients until we have alignment and buy-in on the overall journey\n\u00a0\nCourse-specific\nI think the most urgent to-do here is picking out 2-3 themes for each Inclusive leadership competency (e.g., \u201cUnconscious Bias\u201d and \u201cMicroaggressions\u201d for #1 Awareness and Knowledge)\nSpecifically, the content areas look mostly good to me\u2014I think the blurriest line is between #3 and #4, and I\u2019m wondering if #4 is where we can place something that addresses \u201cPsychological Safety,\u201d or other areas where we know our clients are moving toward but that where we haven\u2019t developed content quite yet. I, personally, am comfortable socializing these themes without a completed course, since most of our clients aren\u2019t anywhere neat that. If it becomes a need/request, we can build it. But we should at least show that we are moving toward something new. \n\u00a0\nHappy to answer any questions and/or voice over the mock slides I made.\n\u00a0\nThanks,\nDan\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\nDaniel Gough, PhD\n(he, him, his)\nPrincipal Consultant\nLCW\n100 S Saunders Rd, Suite 150\nLake Forest, IL 60045\n\u00a0\nOffice +1 773 938 4170\nMobile +1 312 285 9689\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\nwww\n\u00a0\n|\n\u00a0\nTwitter\n \n|\n\u00a0\nFacebook\n\u00a0\n|\n\u00a0\nLinkedIn\n\u00a0\n \n\u00a0\nFrom:\n Chuck Adams <\nc.adams@lcwmail.com\n> \nSent:\n Tuesday, August 9, 2022 1:09 PM\nTo:\n Monica Marcel <\nm.marcel@lcwmail.com\n>; Alisa Kolodizner <\na.kolodizner@lcwmail.com\n>; Kelly Salek <\nk.salek@lcwmail.com\n>; Daniel Gough <\nd.gough@lcwmail.com\n>; Tahitia Timmons <\nt.timmons@lcwmail.com\n>; Andrea Wicks Bowles <\na.wicksbowles@lcwmail.com\n>; Sarah Nodarse <\ns.nodarse@lcwmail.com\n>; Tamara Thorpe <\nt.thorpe@lcwmail.com\n>; Melissa Neu <\nm.neu@lcwmail.com\n>; Nicole Barile <\nn.barile@lcwmail.com\n>\nSubject:\n RE: Inclusion Learning Journeys.pptx\n\u00a0\nCLT \u2013 Can you provide any feedback you might have on these by the end of this week?\n\u00a0\n______________________________________\nChuck Adams \nCo-CEO and Managing Principal\n\u00a0\nLCW\n100 South Saunders Rd, Suite 150\nLake Forest, IL 60045 USA\nOffice: \n+1.773.938.4285\nMobile: +1.630.373.5068\n\u00a0\nwww\n\u00a0:\u00a0\ntwitter\n\u00a0\n:\u00a0\nfacebook\n\u00a0\n:\u00a0\nlinkedin\n\u00a0\n \n\u00a0\nFrom:\n Monica Marcel <\nm.marcel@lcwmail.com\n> \nSent:\n Friday, August 5, 2022 7:04 PM\nTo:\n Chuck Adams <\nc.adams@lcwmail.com\n>; Alisa Kolodizner <\na.kolodizner@lcwmail.com\n>; Kelly Salek <\nk.salek@lcwmail.com\n>; Daniel Gough <\nd.gough@lcwmail.com\n>; Tahitia Timmons <\nt.timmons@lcwmail.com\n>; Andrea Wicks Bowles <\na.wicksbowles@lcwmail.com\n>; Sarah Nodarse <\ns.nodarse@lcwmail.com\n>; Tamara Thorpe <\nt.thorpe@lcwmail.com\n>; Melissa Neu <\nm.neu@lcwmail.com\n>; Nicole Barile <\nn.barile@lcwmail.com\n>\nSubject:\n Inclusion Learning Journeys.pptx\nImportance:\n High\n\u00a0\nHello folks!\nAttached is an updated effort to incorporate feedback on what people liked/didn\u2019t like in the \u201cUTBE\u201d Learning Journey.

It is by no means PRETTY (at all) \u2013 but note I focused on:\ncolor-coding the Inclusive Leadership Competency Framework to align with the already agreed upon graphic for the \u201cSustainable Culture of Inclusion Model\u201d\ncreating distinct inclusive leadership learning journeys for 3 groups: \nAll audiences including individual contributors \nSenior leaders\nMiddle managers\n\u00a0\nTahitia, Andrea, Sarah, Dan and Tamara\n \u2013 I\u2019d love you to see if you like the courses listed under each, and what you might change.\n\u00a0\nChuck, Alisa, Kell, Nicole and Melissa\n \u2013 I\u2019d welcome your thoughts on the overall concepts here, knowing that I\u2019ve tried to capture my expertise and experience for you in a transferrable way.\n\u00a0\nIf we are headed in the right direction \u2013 I will format the \u201cBias Learning Journeys\u201d attached. For now I\u2019ve just documented the courses, trying to minimize (but not necessarily completely eliminate) redundancy with the Inclusive Leadership Journeys so that you can sell both to a given client. \n\u00a0\nI\u2019ll set up time to talk through these with some of you next week. \n\u00a0\n\u00a0\nThank you \n\ud83d\ude0a\nM",

Do you have a date in mind that you\u2019d like to regroup? Or should we circle back on that once we have the last two stakeholder interviews scheduled? Also, Adrianne and I talked about the initial readout, and that will likely be Adrianne, Lisa, J.J. and myself. I know we still have some time, but let us know when we should start looking at dates for that. There might be one or two other groups that we want to review the findings, but we can decide on that as we get closer. \n\u00a0\nOne small request from me. I have a call with one of our APAC DE&I leaders and she was wondering how the APAC focus groups went. Could the team send just a few sentences that I could have on hand to send to her?

At this point Thursday, 7/7: 11am-12pm CT is probably the best option so let me know if I should look at the second/third weeks of July too. \n1:1 Stakeholder Interviews\nScheduling\n: LCW working on time blocks. I also have a meeting with Lisa Moehlenkamp tomorrow to give her a heads up that we\u2019re starting to schedule. \nQuestions:\n FH/LCW to finalize questions. \nI know your team is working on those based on our conversation last week. \nTo Adrianne\u2019s point on the call, we think there are three \u201cthemes\u201d to these conversations: Personal commitment, accountability (for themselves and others) and I also think hearing their perspective on existing barriers or challenges that make it harder for them or their teams to make inclusion a priority, such as business demands from the firm. \nAlso, if there are any other themes that have emerged from the focus groups that we want to ask about, such as the point that Dan brought up about utilization, that is great too. \nI also gave this some thought so sharing some ideas below. \nWhat personal goals/commitments have you made as it relates to DE&I? Can you share an example of actions that have supported those commitments?\nAs a leader, how are you holding yourself accountable? How do you hold other leaders and managers on your team accountable?\nWhere does DE&I fit in with your other business priorities?\nWould love thoughts on this one. I think it\u2019s easy to say that DE&I is a priority but actually practicing that is more difficult. I think our focus on utilization is a great example. So I want to ask a question that digs into what DE&I being a priority looks like \nin action\n for these leaders beyond just\u00a0 \u201cvoicing support.\u201d \nFrom the GM deck: Which processes or policies limit or enhance a culture of inclusion and sense of belonging at FleishmanHillard? What is working or not working?\nDE&I Certification Exploratory Conversation: Confirmed for 6/30\n\u00a0\nLMK if there is anything I missed. \n\u00a0\nThanks!\nRachel \n\u00a0\nRachel Coleman (She/Her)\nVice President \n|\n \nReputation \nFleishmanHillard\n \n|\n \n225 N.

Love the colors, the buckets, the emerging sense of the journey, the foregrounding of inclusive leadership\nI am evaluating these through the lens of how I will talk to a client about these journeys, especially in the context of a 30-45-minute meeting, where clients want to know\nWhat are the skills their leaders need (i.e., the 4 inclusive leader competencies)\nWhat are the content areas they need to engage (e.g., unconscious bias, microaggressions, inclusion)\nI have mocked up a few slides (attached) to place between the SCI and the detailed slides that more succinctly communicate what we are trying to do\u2014many of the more detailed slides are great as backup/appendix slides, as well for upskilling our consultants, but too much information for our clients to digest at first \nSimilarly, the hierarchy-specific journeys are great and useful for similar reasons, but too much information for clients until we have alignment and buy-in on the overall journey\n\u00a0\nCourse-specific\nI think the most urgent to-do here is picking out 2-3 themes for each Inclusive leadership competency (e.g., \u201cUnconscious Bias\u201d and \u201cMicroaggressions\u201d for #1 Awareness and Knowledge)\nSpecifically, the content areas look mostly good to me\u2014I think the blurriest line is between #3 and #4, and I\u2019m wondering if #4 is where we can place something that addresses \u201cPsychological Safety,\u201d or other areas where we know our clients are moving toward but that where we haven\u2019t developed content quite yet. I, personally, am comfortable socializing these themes without a completed course, since most of our clients aren\u2019t anywhere neat that. If it becomes a need/request, we can build it. But we should at least show that we are moving toward something new. \n\u00a0\nHappy to answer any questions and/or voice over the mock slides I made.\n\u00a0\nThanks,\nDan\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\nDaniel Gough, PhD\n(he, him, his)\nPrincipal Consultant\nLCW\n100 S Saunders Rd, Suite 150\nLake Forest, IL 60045\n\u00a0\nOffice +1 773 938 4170\nMobile +1 312 285 9689\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\nwww\n\u00a0\n|\n\u00a0\nTwitter\n \n|\n\u00a0\nFacebook\n\u00a0\n|\n\u00a0\nLinkedIn\n\u00a0\n \n\u00a0\nFrom:\n Chuck Adams <\nc.adams@lcwmail.com\n> \nSent:\n Tuesday, August 9, 2022 1:09 PM\nTo:\n Monica Marcel <\nm.marcel@lcwmail.com\n>; Alisa Kolodizner <\na.kolodizner@lcwmail.com\n>; Kelly Salek <\nk.salek@lcwmail.com\n>; Daniel Gough <\nd.gough@lcwmail.com\n>; Tahitia Timmons <\nt.timmons@lcwmail.com\n>; Andrea Wicks Bowles <\na.wicksbowles@lcwmail.com\n>; Sarah Nodarse <\ns.nodarse@lcwmail.com\n>; Tamara Thorpe <\nt.thorpe@lcwmail.com\n>; Melissa Neu <\nm.neu@lcwmail.com\n>; Nicole Barile <\nn.barile@lcwmail.com\n>\nSubject:\n RE: Inclusion Learning Journeys.pptx\n\u00a0\nCLT \u2013 Can you provide any feedback you might have on these by the end of this week?\n\u00a0\n______________________________________\nChuck Adams \nCo-CEO and Managing Principal\n\u00a0\nLCW\n100 South Saunders Rd, Suite 150\nLake Forest, IL 60045 USA\nOffice: \n+1.773.938.4285\nMobile: +1.630.373.5068\n\u00a0\nwww\n\u00a0:\u00a0\ntwitter\n\u00a0\n:\u00a0\nfacebook\n\u00a0\n:\u00a0\nlinkedin\n\u00a0\n \n\u00a0\nFrom:\n Monica Marcel <\nm.marcel@lcwmail.com\n> \nSent:\n Friday, August 5, 2022 7:04 PM\nTo:\n Chuck Adams <\nc.adams@lcwmail.com\n>; Alisa Kolodizner <\na.kolodizner@lcwmail.com\n>; Kelly Salek <\nk.salek@lcwmail.com\n>; Daniel Gough <\nd.gough@lcwmail.com\n>; Tahitia Timmons <\nt.timmons@lcwmail.com\n>; Andrea Wicks Bowles <\na.wicksbowles@lcwmail.com\n>; Sarah Nodarse <\ns.nodarse@lcwmail.com\n>; Tamara Thorpe <\nt.thorpe@lcwmail.com\n>; Melissa Neu <\nm.neu@lcwmail.com\n>; Nicole Barile <\nn.barile@lcwmail.com\n>\nSubject:\n Inclusion Learning Journeys.pptx\nImportance:\n High\n\u00a0\nHello folks!\nAttached is an updated effort to incorporate feedback on what people liked/didn\u2019t like in the \u201cUTBE\u201d Learning Journey.

I thought they were leaning towards a more Girls who code and/or we hire old people, or women and aging thing.\u00a0 But clarify with them, if they also do not need two facilitators you could spend that on an external expert in the tech field OR try and get Kelly to do it as a woman in tech with experience in the field. \nThanks\nTahitia",

I, personally, am comfortable socializing these themes without a completed course, since most of our clients aren\u2019t anywhere neat that. If it becomes a need/request, we can build it.

The term of each SOWshall be as specified in that SOW. \nTo the extent any SOWs remain in effect upon the expiration of thisAgreement pursuant to this Section 2, the Agreement shall automatically continue solely with respect tosuch SOW\n(s) but no additional SOWs may be issued hereunder unless the Parties agree to renew the Termpursuant to this Section 2.\n\u00a0\nWhat we have done with other clients is to amend the MSA (not create a new one) & just extend the term.\n\u00a0\nSo, first see if Randy has the final doc. Then share with me (if you get it), and you can loop me into the email chain so I can see if I can get them to agree to amend the term.\n\u00a0\nMake sense?\n\u00a0\nNicole Barile\nDirector of Operations\n, \nLCW\n\u00a0\nFrom:\n Tahitia Timmons <\nt.timmons@lcwmail.com\n> \nSent:\n Thursday, August 4, 2022 4:58 PM\nTo:\n Nicole Barile <\nn.barile@lcwmail.com\n>\nSubject:\n Danaher MSA question \n\u00a0\nHi Nicole, \nI have a request from Danaher to send a copy of our current MSA to them. I found this version, but it says draft, along with this signature page. Can you double-check if this is the newest MSA? I was told by we need an MSA agreement no older than 1 year. If we do not have one, we will need to start the MSA process with them which may take a few months. \nAlso if this is it am I ok to send what I found which has track changes still on. \nThank you \n------------------------------------------------------\nTahitia Timmons\n(she/her/hers)\nSenior Consultant\nLCW \n100 S Saunders Rd, Suite 150\nLake Forest, IL 60045\n\u00a0 \n\u00a0\n \n\u00a0\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\nwww\n\u00a0\n|\n\u00a0\nTwitter\n \n|\n\u00a0\nFacebook\n\u00a0\n|\n\u00a0\nLinkedIn",

The term of each SOWshall be as specified in that SOW. \nTo the extent any SOWs remain in effect upon the expiration of thisAgreement pursuant to this Section 2, the Agreement shall automatically continue solely with respect tosuch SOW\n(s) but no additional SOWs may be issued hereunder unless the Parties agree to renew the Termpursuant to this Section 2.\n\u00a0\nWhat we have done with other clients is to amend the MSA (not create a new one) & just extend the term.\n\u00a0\nSo, first see if Randy has the final doc. Then share with me (if you get it), and you can loop me into the email chain so I can see if I can get them to agree to amend the term.\n\u00a0\nMake sense?\n\u00a0\nNicole Barile\nDirector of Operations\n, \nLCW\n\u00a0\nFrom:\n Tahitia Timmons <t.timmons@lcwmail.com> \nSent:\n Thursday, August 4, 2022 4:58 PM\nTo:\n Nicole Barile <n.barile@lcwmail.com>\nSubject:\n Danaher MSA question \n\u00a0\nHi Nicole, \nI have a request from Danaher to send a copy of our current MSA to them.

At this point Thursday, 7/7: 11am-12pm CT is probably the best option so let me know if I should look at the second/third weeks of July too. \n1:1 Stakeholder Interviews\nScheduling\n: LCW working on time blocks. I also have a meeting with Lisa Moehlenkamp tomorrow to give her a heads up that we\u2019re starting to schedule. \nQuestions:\n FH/LCW to finalize questions. \nI know your team is working on those based on our conversation last week. \nTo Adrianne\u2019s point on the call, we think there are three \u201cthemes\u201d to these conversations: Personal commitment, accountability (for themselves and others) and I also think hearing their perspective on existing barriers or challenges that make it harder for them or their teams to make inclusion a priority, such as business demands from the firm. \nAlso, if there are any other themes that have emerged from the focus groups that we want to ask about, such as the point that Dan brought up about utilization, that is great too. \nI also gave this some thought so sharing some ideas below. \nWhat personal goals/commitments have you made as it relates to DE&I? Can you share an example of actions that have supported those commitments?\nAs a leader, how are you holding yourself accountable? How do you hold other leaders and managers on your team accountable?\nWhere does DE&I fit in with your other business priorities?\nWould love thoughts on this one. I think it\u2019s easy to say that DE&I is a priority but actually practicing that is more difficult. I think our focus on utilization is a great example. So I want to ask a question that digs into what DE&I being a priority looks like \nin action\n for these leaders beyond just\u00a0 \u201cvoicing support.\u201d \nFrom the GM deck: Which processes or policies limit or enhance a culture of inclusion and sense of belonging at FleishmanHillard? What is working or not working?\nDE&I Certification Exploratory Conversation: Confirmed for 6/30\n\u00a0\nLMK if there is anything I missed. \n\u00a0\nThanks!\nRachel \n\u00a0\nRachel Coleman (She/Her)\nVice President \n|\n \nReputation \nFleishmanHillard\n \n|\n \n225 N.

At this point Thursday, 7/7: 11am-12pm CT is probably the best option so let me know if I should look at the second/third weeks of July too. \n1:1 Stakeholder Interviews\nScheduling\n: LCW working on time blocks. I also have a meeting with Lisa Moehlenkamp tomorrow to give her a heads up that we\u2019re starting to schedule. \nQuestions:\n FH/LCW to finalize questions. \nI know your team is working on those based on our conversation last week. \nTo Adrianne\u2019s point on the call, we think there are three \u201cthemes\u201d to these conversations: Personal commitment, accountability (for themselves and others) and I also think hearing their perspective on existing barriers or challenges that make it harder for them or their teams to make inclusion a priority, such as business demands from the firm. \nAlso, if there are any other themes that have emerged from the focus groups that we want to ask about, such as the point that Dan brought up about utilization, that is great too. \nI also gave this some thought so sharing some ideas below. \nWhat personal goals/commitments have you made as it relates to DE&I? Can you share an example of actions that have supported those commitments?\nAs a leader, how are you holding yourself accountable? How do you hold other leaders and managers on your team accountable?\nWhere does DE&I fit in with your other business priorities?\nWould love thoughts on this one. I think it\u2019s easy to say that DE&I is a priority but actually practicing that is more difficult. I think our focus on utilization is a great example. So I want to ask a question that digs into what DE&I being a priority looks like \nin action\n for these leaders beyond just\u00a0 \u201cvoicing support.\u201d \nFrom the GM deck: Which processes or policies limit or enhance a culture of inclusion and sense of belonging at FleishmanHillard? What is working or not working?\nDE&I Certification Exploratory Conversation: Confirmed for 6/30\n\u00a0\nLMK if there is anything I missed. \n\u00a0\nThanks!\nRachel \n\u00a0\nRachel Coleman (She/Her)\nVice President \n|\n \nReputation \nFleishmanHillard\n \n|\n \n225 N.

But we could also find another way to include that.\n\u00a0\nHappy to help however I can.\n\u00a0\nThanks!\nGrace\n\u00a0\nFrom:\n Tahitia Timmons <t.timmons@lcwmail.com> \nSent:\n Wednesday, August 3, 2022 11:52 AM\nTo:\n Nicole Barile <n.barile@lcwmail.com>; Grace Vottero <g.vottero@lcwmail.com>\nSubject:\n Process/SOP template\n\u00a0\nHello, \nI am attaching a blank template that I would like to get some feedback on.

I have these at 25 users and 6 months (they are not doing 12 months). \u00a0There were also price increases since the list you shared and I cannot override them BUT I was able to still have the 25% show up, however that is contingent on the prepay and 4+ and will no longer be available moving forward\nI am also enclosing a link to a zip folder with pdfs of the facilitated titles we discussed. \nThat is available here \nhttps://www.dropbox.com/l/AACk8tB0EdaazCqPPmltk1-8gcXTHuk8WVs\nPlease let me know that this opens and is viewable. \nHopefully this will assist you when you meet with the group on Monday. \nThanks and have a great weekend!\n\u00a0\nTahitia\n\u00a0\n------------------------------------------------------\nTahitia Timmons\n(she/her/hers)\nSenior Consultant\nLCW \n100 S Saunders Rd, Suite 150\nLake Forest, IL 60045\n\u00a0 \n\u00a0\n \n\u00a0\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\nwww\n\u00a0\n|\n\u00a0\nTwitter\n \n|\n\u00a0\nFacebook\n\u00a0\n|\n\u00a0\nLinkedIn",

    "body": "Do more than share your scheduling link... \nHi Tahitia,\nThis is Jeff, head of product marketing for Calendly. I\u2019d love to share a few tips and product updates with you.\n\u00a0\nTip of the Day: Scheduling with a teammate\nThis shouldn\u2019t surprise you, but I spend a lot of time reading customers\u2019 tweets and other social media posts about Calendly. Know what one of the most surprising requests is?\n\u201cI wish I could use Calendly to bring my coworker into a meeting.\u201d\"\nWe have the feature! It\u2019s \nCollective Scheduling\n, one of our \nmulti-person scheduling options\n.\n\u00a0\nImagine using Collective event types to:\nTeam up with a subject-matter expert to close a sales deal with a prospect\nJoin your colleague for a meeting with a freelancer or agency\nConvince a new recruit to join your company \u2014 together with a hiring manager\nCollective-scheduling proponent and Square\u2019s partnership manager Winta Habteslassie\n puts the pain best: \u201cIt was so difficult to manage three or four different calendars across the board. And by the time I would find an open slot and a partner would get back to me, I\u2019d have to go back and forth, telling them \u2018hey I'm sorry, actually those days and times that I provided to you are no longer available.\u2019\u201d\u00a0\nRead Winta\u2019s experience with Collective event types in this blog post\n.\nTry Collective Scheduling\nRouting Forms Update: Tool for Developers\nEntrepreneur Yaron Hadad\n says, \u201cI love Calendly Routing Forms.\u201d\nIf you\u2019re unfamiliar, our Routing Forms feature lets you \u201cqualify,\u201d or request information from potential meeting attendees, and then automatically direct them to a specific scheduling page or website based on their responses.\u00a0 \u00a0\nNow, \nsoftware developers can build third-party workflow applications that programmatically pull Routing Form responses out of Calendly via our API\n. This enables teams to trigger automated workflows the moment an individual submits a form.\nLearn More\nMobile Apps: Get more scheduling flexibility\nWe are constantly improving Calendly\u2019s mobile apps for \niOS\n and \nAndroid\n. Our \nlatest improvements\n add more of the functionality you\u2019re accustomed to, as well as a few that make so much more sense when you\u2019re on the go:\nExpanded options for sharing your availability:\n Create and share a QR code for an Event Type, customize the message that accompanies your shared links, and more.\nEasier rescheduling for invitees:\n Send a rescheduling-specific link that lets invitees choose a new date/time on your calendar, or reschedule the meeting on behalf of the invitee.\nManage your availability from anywhere:\n It\u2019s now easier than ever to quickly adjust your time zone because you\u2019re traveling, or block out specific days because of prior engagement, or adjust your availability for personal time off.\nLearn More\nFeatured Integrations: Google Analytics & Facebook Pixel\nUnderstanding customer traffic and conversion rates is a critical aspect of marketing your business.\u00a0\nOur \nGoogle Analytics\n and \nFacebook (Meta) Pixel\n integrations enable Calendly users to track the effectiveness of scheduling and Facebook campaigns where users are directed to a Calendly booking call-to-action (CTA). With this information, marketers can gain insights into their campaigns and create more specific targeting and ads.\u00a0\nNow, both of these integrations can track events related to Calendly\u2019s \nRouting Forms\n feature. With these updates, teams can use Facebook Pixels or Google Analytics to understand how their routing forms are performing and converting. For example, imagine analyzing when a prospect lands on and submits a routing form.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\n\u00a0\nLearn More\nAdditional Resources\nAssign high-volume meetings more efficiently with Round Robin\nThe Time Economy customer survey results\nTeam scheduling options overview\nThanks for reading,\u00a0\nJeff Hardison\nHead of Product Marketing\u00a0\nCalendly\n \n \n \n \nSent from Calendly\n88 N Avondale Rd #603\nAvondale Estates, GA 30002\nUnsubscribe\n from our emails",

I was slightly concerned around timing and not feeling like I was speed talking through it. \u00a0I am highlighting what I will say out loud the rest would go in the chat.\nWould love feedback. \nThanks\n\u00a0\n0:19 to 0:23 (4 minutes = 3 minutes for quiz + 1 minute for debrief of Q1; note rest of questions debriefed on next slide)\nFAC B\nOPEN POLL 1: Let\u2019s do a quiz\u2026 (FACILITATOR: Quiz/Poll questions are in separate Word document in UTLE folder.)\nDebrief q#1 = 1 min\nSay: Here\u2019s a pop quiz about facts and history about the Latinx community in the U.S. No googling allowed.\n [Give people 3 minutes to complete quiz.]. \nAfter everyone is done with quiz, go through and debrief answers 1 by 1.\u00a0 \nQuiz question #1: People whose cultural background or heritage is Latin American prefer to identify as:\nThe answer is \u2018any of the above.\u2019 Different people prefer to identify differently.\u00a0 \nInoculate the question \u201cJust tell me what to call them\u201d by proactively bringing it up \u2013 \n\u00a0When in doubt, just ask the person, how do you identify?\nHispanic\n refers to \nlanguage \n\u2013 someone with origins in a Spanish speaking country. This includes Spain but not countries like Brazil (Portuguese) or Haiti (Haitian Creole- based largely on French).\n [If anyone asks: Belize (ENG), Guyana (ENG), Suriname (Dutch), and French Guiana (French)]. \nLatino/a\n relates to \ngeographic location\n \u2013 meaning a person whose country of origin is within Latin America (Central and South America and the Caribbean). This includes people with cultural background in the non-Spanish speaking countries like Brazil.\nLatinx\n is being used more and more, especially by younger people, as a gender-neutral word for Latino/a identity. It includes people of any gender or gender identity. \nChicano\n refers to Mexican-American heritage. It\u2019s also associated with the Mexican-American labor and civil rights movement of the 1960\u2019s and 70\u2019s. For many Mexican Americans, it connotes pride in a shared cultural, ethnic and community identity.\nCountry of origin:\n Many people prefer to identify not only as Latino or Hispanic, but also or primarily with their country of origin, e.g., as Guatemalan-American, Mexican-American, Venezuelan, or Cuban-American. \nOther: Boricua\n means Puerto Rican \u2013 it comes from the indigenous Puerto Ricans\u2019 name for the island: Borik\u00e9n or Borinquen. \nSpanish\n - Some people call Latinos \u201cSpanish\u201d \u2013 but what does Spanish mean? Right, that you\u2019re from Spain.\nI will be referring to American residents of Latin American origin interchangeably as Latinx, Latino, and Hispanic.\n\u00a0\nTransition\n: \nOkay, let\u2019s move on to q#2, what percent of the population identifies as Latinx? \nMOVE TO NEXT SLIDE TO DEBRIEF Q #2\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 LATINX image adapted from: \nhttps://www.elle.com/culture/career-politics/a38249/latinx-activists-roundtable/\n \n\u00a0\nDebrief remaining questions \u2013 provide answer key in a handout to save time\n2. Q2: The answer is (e). \nLatinos represent 18.7% of the U.S. population \nor about 62.1 million people (2020 census).\n \nOther answers\n: 12.4% Black non-Latino, 10.2% two or more races, 6% Asian, 1.1% Am Indian & Alaska Native (\nIf asked:\n .2% Hawaiian and Pacific Islander and 61.6% white)\n.\nSource: \nhttps://www.census.gov/library/visualizations/interactive/race-and-ethnicity-in-the-united-state-2010-and-2020-census.html\nLatinos are the largest U.S. minority and the 2nd fastest growing ethnic group (after Asians) in the US. The US Census predicts the Latino pop will reach almost 30% of the population by 2060.\nThis \ntable shows the countries of origin for different Latino groups in the US. \nFrom the most recent 2020 US Census.\nAs you can see people of Mexican origin represent the biggest group \u2013 \n61.5%\n / \n9.7% \nare Puerto Rican / Salvadoran and Cuban Latinos make up almost \n4% each\n / \n3.4%\n Dominican / \n2.7%\n Guatemalan/ Colombia 2%, Honduras 1.8%\n3. [Q5 in UTLE Quiz]. The first European language spoken in what is now the United States was: (a) English, (b) Dutch, (c) Portuguese, \n(d) Spanish,\n (e) French\n.\n\u00a0In 1565 - \nThe first permanent European settlement, Saint Augustine, Florida, is established in what is now the U.S. by Spanish admiral Pedro Men\u00e9ndez de Avil\u00e9s, \nintroducing Catholicism and the Spanish language to the nation\n. \nNote that this was 42 years \nbefore\n the first permanent English settlement, Jamestown, VA, was established 1607.\n\u00a0\n4. [Q7 in UTLE Quiz]. True or \nFalse:\n About 25% of the 500k-2 million Mexicans deported by the U.S. in the 1930\u2019s were American citizens. \nEXPLAIN: \nIn the prework that we have to prepare people for the full 4-hour Cultural Immersion, they have a chance to watch a short video and read some articles that include important history\u2014like this about the mass deportations of Mexicans and Mexican Americans from the U.S., that took place called the \n\u201cMexican Repatriation\u201d which took place during the Great Depression\n \n(1929-36).\nThe answer is False \u2013 the answer is 60%\n. (If anyone asks, the vast majority were birthright citizens). Latinos were widely \nblamed for exacerbating the overall economic consequences of the Great Depression.\nWhile supported by the federal government, \nmany of the deportations were largely organized and carried out by city and state governments, with support from private companies. For this reason it\u2019s nearly impossible to quantify the exact number of people who were deported.\nTransition\n: Let\u2019s watch a video to kick off some key historical events for Latinx in the U.S. \n============================================================================\nSources:\nhttps://www.nationalgeographic.com/magazine/2020/07/latinos-hispanic-power-america-immigration-future/\n2016 American Community Survey (HISPANIC OR LATINO BY SPECIFIC ORIGIN) - \nhttps://factfinder.census.gov/bkmk/table/1.0/en/ACS/16_1YR/B03001\n) \n\u00a0\n------------------------------------------------------\nTahitia Timmons\n(she/her/hers)\nSenior Consultant\nLCW \n100 S Saunders Rd, Suite 150\nLake Forest, IL 60045\n\u00a0 \n\u00a0\n \n\u00a0\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\nwww\n\u00a0\n|\n\u00a0\nTwitter\n \n|\n\u00a0\nFacebook\n\u00a0\n|\n\u00a0\nLinkedIn\n\u00a0\nFrom:\n Jake Pieczynski <\nj.pieczynski@lcwmail.com\n> \nSent:\n Tuesday, July 26, 2022 6:01 PM\nTo:\n Ada Vargas <\na.vargas@lcwmail.com\n>; Tahitia Timmons <\nt.timmons@lcwmail.com\n>\nSubject:\n RE: Hispanic Heritage Event \n\u00a0\nGreat thank you both!

This includes Spain but not countries like Brazil (Portuguese) or Haiti (Haitian Creole- based largely on French).\n [If anyone asks: Belize (ENG), Guyana (ENG), Suriname (Dutch), and French Guiana (French)]. \nLatino/a\n relates to \ngeographic location\n \u2013 meaning a person whose country of origin is within Latin America (Central and South America and the Caribbean). This includes people with cultural background in the non-Spanish speaking countries like Brazil.\nLatinx\n is being used more and more, especially by younger people, as a gender-neutral word for Latino/a identity. It includes people of any gender or gender identity. \nChicano\n refers to Mexican-American heritage. It\u2019s also associated with the Mexican-American labor and civil rights movement of the 1960\u2019s and 70\u2019s. For many Mexican Americans, it connotes pride in a shared cultural, ethnic and community identity.\nCountry of origin:\n Many people prefer to identify not only as Latino or Hispanic, but also or primarily with their country of origin, e.g., as Guatemalan-American, Mexican-American, Venezuelan, or Cuban-American. \nOther: Boricua\n means Puerto Rican \u2013 it comes from the indigenous Puerto Ricans\u2019 name for the island: Borik\u00e9n or Borinquen. \nSpanish\n - Some people call Latinos \u201cSpanish\u201d \u2013 but what does Spanish mean? Right, that you\u2019re from Spain.\nI will be referring to American residents of Latin American origin interchangeably as Latinx, Latino, and Hispanic.\n\u00a0\nTransition\n: \nOkay, let\u2019s move on to q#2, what percent of the population identifies as Latinx? \nMOVE TO NEXT SLIDE TO DEBRIEF Q #2\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 LATINX image adapted from: \nhttps://www.elle.com/culture/career-politics/a38249/latinx-activists-roundtable/\n \n\u00a0\nDebrief remaining questions \u2013 provide answer key in a handout to save time\n2. Q2: The answer is (e). \nLatinos represent 18.7% of the U.S. population \nor about 62.1 million people (2020 census).\n \nOther answers\n: 12.4% Black non-Latino, 10.2% two or more races, 6% Asian, 1.1% Am Indian & Alaska Native (\nIf asked:\n .2% Hawaiian and Pacific Islander and 61.6% white)\n.\nSource: \nhttps://www.census.gov/library/visualizations/interactive/race-and-ethnicity-in-the-united-state-2010-and-2020-census.html\nLatinos are the largest U.S. minority and the 2nd fastest growing ethnic group (after Asians) in the US. The US Census predicts the Latino pop will reach almost 30% of the population by 2060.\nThis \ntable shows the countries of origin for different Latino groups in the US. \nFrom the most recent 2020 US Census.\nAs you can see people of Mexican origin represent the biggest group \u2013 \n61.5%\n / \n9.7% \nare Puerto Rican / Salvadoran and Cuban Latinos make up almost \n4% each\n / \n3.4%\n Dominican / \n2.7%\n Guatemalan/ Colombia 2%, Honduras 1.8%\n3. [Q5 in UTLE Quiz]. The first European language spoken in what is now the United States was: (a) English, (b) Dutch, (c) Portuguese, \n(d) Spanish,\n (e) French\n.\n\u00a0In 1565 - \nThe first permanent European settlement, Saint Augustine, Florida, is established in what is now the U.S. by Spanish admiral Pedro Men\u00e9ndez de Avil\u00e9s, \nintroducing Catholicism and the Spanish language to the nation\n. \nNote that this was 42 years \nbefore\n the first permanent English settlement, Jamestown, VA, was established 1607.\n\u00a0\n4. [Q7 in UTLE Quiz]. True or \nFalse:\n About 25% of the 500k-2 million Mexicans deported by the U.S. in the 1930\u2019s were American citizens. \nEXPLAIN: \nIn the prework that we have to prepare people for the full 4-hour Cultural Immersion, they have a chance to watch a short video and read some articles that include important history\u2014like this about the mass deportations of Mexicans and Mexican Americans from the U.S., that took place called the \n\u201cMexican Repatriation\u201d which took place during the Great Depression\n \n(1929-36).\nThe answer is False \u2013 the answer is 60%\n. (If anyone asks, the vast majority were birthright citizens). Latinos were widely \nblamed for exacerbating the overall economic consequences of the Great Depression.\nWhile supported by the federal government, \nmany of the deportations were largely organized and carried out by city and state governments, with support from private companies. For this reason it\u2019s nearly impossible to quantify the exact number of people who were deported.\nTransition\n: Let\u2019s watch a video to kick off some key historical events for Latinx in the U.S. \n============================================================================\nSources:\nhttps://www.nationalgeographic.com/magazine/2020/07/latinos-hispanic-power-america-immigration-future/\n2016 American Community Survey (HISPANIC OR LATINO BY SPECIFIC ORIGIN) - \nhttps://factfinder.census.gov/bkmk/table/1.0/en/ACS/16_1YR/B03001\n) \n\u00a0\n------------------------------------------------------\nTahitia Timmons\n(she/her/hers)\nSenior Consultant\nLCW \n100 S Saunders Rd, Suite 150\nLake Forest, IL 60045\n\u00a0 \n\u00a0\n \n\u00a0\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\nwww\n\u00a0\n|\n\u00a0\nTwitter\n \n|\n\u00a0\nFacebook\n\u00a0\n|\n\u00a0\nLinkedIn\n\u00a0\nFrom:\n Jake Pieczynski <\nj.pieczynski@lcwmail.com\n> \nSent:\n Tuesday, July 26, 2022 6:01 PM\nTo:\n Ada Vargas <\na.vargas@lcwmail.com\n>; Tahitia Timmons <\nt.timmons@lcwmail.com\n>\nSubject:\n RE: Hispanic Heritage Event \n\u00a0\nGreat thank you both!

This includes Spain but not countries like Brazil (Portuguese) or Haiti (Haitian Creole- based largely on French).\n [If anyone asks: Belize (ENG), Guyana (ENG), Suriname (Dutch), and French Guiana (French)]. \nLatino/a\n relates to \ngeographic location\n \u2013 meaning a person whose country of origin is within Latin America (Central and South America and the Caribbean). This includes people with cultural background in the non-Spanish speaking countries like Brazil.\nLatinx\n is being used more and more, especially by younger people, as a gender-neutral word for Latino/a identity. It includes people of any gender or gender identity. \nChicano\n refers to Mexican-American heritage. It\u2019s also associated with the Mexican-American labor and civil rights movement of the 1960\u2019s and 70\u2019s. For many Mexican Americans, it connotes pride in a shared cultural, ethnic and community identity.\nCountry of origin:\n Many people prefer to identify not only as Latino or Hispanic, but also or primarily with their country of origin, e.g., as Guatemalan-American, Mexican-American, Venezuelan, or Cuban-American. \nOther: Boricua\n means Puerto Rican \u2013 it comes from the indigenous Puerto Ricans\u2019 name for the island: Borik\u00e9n or Borinquen. \nSpanish\n - Some people call Latinos \u201cSpanish\u201d \u2013 but what does Spanish mean? Right, that you\u2019re from Spain.\nI will be referring to American residents of Latin American origin interchangeably as Latinx, Latino, and Hispanic.\n\u00a0\nTransition\n: \nOkay, let\u2019s move on to q#2, what percent of the population identifies as Latinx? \nMOVE TO NEXT SLIDE TO DEBRIEF Q #2\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 LATINX image adapted from: \nhttps://www.elle.com/culture/career-politics/a38249/latinx-activists-roundtable/\n \n\u00a0\nDebrief remaining questions \u2013 provide answer key in a handout to save time\n2. Q2: The answer is (e). \nLatinos represent 18.7% of the U.S. population \nor about 62.1 million people (2020 census).\n \nOther answers\n: 12.4% Black non-Latino, 10.2% two or more races, 6% Asian, 1.1% Am Indian & Alaska Native (\nIf asked:\n .2% Hawaiian and Pacific Islander and 61.6% white)\n.\nSource: \nhttps://www.census.gov/library/visualizations/interactive/race-and-ethnicity-in-the-united-state-2010-and-2020-census.html\nLatinos are the largest U.S. minority and the 2nd fastest growing ethnic group (after Asians) in the US. The US Census predicts the Latino pop will reach almost 30% of the population by 2060.\nThis \ntable shows the countries of origin for different Latino groups in the US. \nFrom the most recent 2020 US Census.\nAs you can see people of Mexican origin represent the biggest group \u2013 \n61.5%\n / \n9.7% \nare Puerto Rican / Salvadoran and Cuban Latinos make up almost \n4% each\n / \n3.4%\n Dominican / \n2.7%\n Guatemalan/ Colombia 2%, Honduras 1.8%\n3. [Q5 in UTLE Quiz]. The first European language spoken in what is now the United States was: (a) English, (b) Dutch, (c) Portuguese, \n(d) Spanish,\n (e) French\n.\n\u00a0In 1565 - \nThe first permanent European settlement, Saint Augustine, Florida, is established in what is now the U.S. by Spanish admiral Pedro Men\u00e9ndez de Avil\u00e9s, \nintroducing Catholicism and the Spanish language to the nation\n. \nNote that this was 42 years \nbefore\n the first permanent English settlement, Jamestown, VA, was established 1607.\n\u00a0\n4. [Q7 in UTLE Quiz]. True or \nFalse:\n About 25% of the 500k-2 million Mexicans deported by the U.S. in the 1930\u2019s were American citizens. \nEXPLAIN: \nIn the prework that we have to prepare people for the full 4-hour Cultural Immersion, they have a chance to watch a short video and read some articles that include important history\u2014like this about the mass deportations of Mexicans and Mexican Americans from the U.S., that took place called the \n\u201cMexican Repatriation\u201d which took place during the Great Depression\n \n(1929-36).\nThe answer is False \u2013 the answer is 60%\n. (If anyone asks, the vast majority were birthright citizens). Latinos were widely \nblamed for exacerbating the overall economic consequences of the Great Depression.\nWhile supported by the federal government, \nmany of the deportations were largely organized and carried out by city and state governments, with support from private companies. For this reason it\u2019s nearly impossible to quantify the exact number of people who were deported.\nTransition\n: Let\u2019s watch a video to kick off some key historical events for Latinx in the U.S. \n============================================================================\nSources:\nhttps://www.nationalgeographic.com/magazine/2020/07/latinos-hispanic-power-america-immigration-future/\n2016 American Community Survey (HISPANIC OR LATINO BY SPECIFIC ORIGIN) - \nhttps://factfinder.census.gov/bkmk/table/1.0/en/ACS/16_1YR/B03001\n) \n\u00a0\n------------------------------------------------------\nTahitia Timmons\n(she/her/hers)\nSenior Consultant\nLCW \n100 S Saunders Rd, Suite 150\nLake Forest, IL 60045\n\u00a0 \n\u00a0\n \n\u00a0\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\nwww\n\u00a0\n|\n\u00a0\nTwitter\n \n|\n\u00a0\nFacebook\n\u00a0\n|\n\u00a0\nLinkedIn\n\u00a0\nFrom:\n Jake Pieczynski <\nj.pieczynski@lcwmail.com\n> \nSent:\n Tuesday, July 26, 2022 6:01 PM\nTo:\n Ada Vargas <\na.vargas@lcwmail.com\n>; Tahitia Timmons <\nt.timmons@lcwmail.com\n>\nSubject:\n RE: Hispanic Heritage Event \n\u00a0\nGreat thank you both!

Can you share an example of actions that have supported those commitments?\nAs a leader, how are you holding yourself accountable? How do you hold other leaders and managers on your team accountable?\nWhere does DE&I fit in with your other business priorities?\nWould love thoughts on this one. I think it\u2019s easy to say that DE&I is a priority but actually practicing that is more difficult. I think our focus on utilization is a great example. So I want to ask a question that digs into what DE&I being a priority looks like \nin action\n for these leaders beyond just\u00a0 \u201cvoicing support.\u201d \nFrom the GM deck: Which processes or policies limit or enhance a culture of inclusion and sense of belonging at FleishmanHillard?

Suppose you are interested in being a part of the community of practice. In that case, this will allow you to form a virtual community depending on the purpose and needs of each individual. \nOur official Communities of Practice launch date will be January 5th, 2023. Currently, the Linked In groups are not visible to the public; we would like all of our members to have first dibs on them.\nIf you have any questions or concerns, please email \nAmbermartin@societyfordiversity.org.\n\u00a0 \nDomain:\n\u00a0Community members have a shared domain of interest, competence and commitment that distinguishes them from others. This shared domain creates common ground, inspires members to participate, guides their learning, and gives meaning to their actions.\nCommunity\n:\nMembers pursue this interest through joint activities, discussions, problem-solving opportunities, information sharing and relationship building. The notion of a community creates the social fabric for enabling collective learning. A strong community fosters interaction and encourages a willingness to share ideas.\n \nPractice:\nCommunity members are actual practitioners in this domain of interest and build a shared repertoire of resources and ideas that they take back to their practice. While the domain provides the general area of interest for the community, the practice is the specific focus around which the community develops, shares and maintains its core of collective knowledge\n.\u00a0\nCOMMUNITIES OF PRACTICE GROUPS\u00a0\nConference Planning Community (Chair: Jamie Hale, Co-Chair Dr. Danielle Jackman)\nPlan the Society for Diversity's \n2022 \nConference, including developing the conference theme; choosing a location; identifying and selecting speakers; recruiting and assigning event day volunteers; assisting with promotions; and more! The conference will focus\u00a0\non an\u00a0opportunity for you to reimagine your resource groups with intentional strategies, fresh insights, and bold ideas. We'll share and discover a game plan for employee participation, ERG/BRG management, recruiting, and more\n!\nJoin Now \nMember News and Recognitions Community (Chair: Maggie Roju, Co-Chair Lea Ann Bowers)\nShine the spotlight on the work of different members monthly, by developing a profile that consists of a brief bio and Q&A. This Community will also report on the accomplishments of members, such as promotions, awards, and other accomplishments.\nJoin Now \nAdvocacy Community (Chair: Harry Petaway, CDE, Tahitia Timmons, CDP)\nThis Community of Practice will determine how the Society for Diversity can play an important role in changing the future of Equity and Inclusion by providing support for initiatives that will advance the field, including but not limited to ensuring that the role is formally recognized by the U.S. Department of Labor, Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS); writing letters of support for/against legislation, court cases, or United Nations (U.N.) efforts; and monitoring global trends in Equity, Diversity and Inclusion.\nJoin Now \nCareers & Collaborations Community (Chair: Jenn Tardy, CDE, Co-Chair: Taheti Watson)\nOffer career advancement tips and advice, as well as help members to navigate through career pitfalls or recover from a setback. This Community can also coordinate opportunities for group meet-ups before/after conferences, or host lunch and learn events at member's offices.\nJoin Now \n\u00a0 \nD&I Resources Community (Chair: Enid-Mai Jones, Co-Chair: Maritza Guerr\na\n)\nIdentify webinar speakers, write blogs, share events, or suggest books and reports that members should read. This Community of Practice is also responsible for creating member polls and/or identifying resources that Equity, Diversity and Inclusion leaders need to succeed.\nJoin Now \nThis message was sent to you by \nThe Society for Diversity Inc.\nIf you no longer wish to receive these emails, you can\u00a0\nunsubscribe\n\u00a0at any time\n111 Front Street West, Suite 111, Toronto, Ontario M0 0L0 Canada\n1-111-111-1111, \nhttps://societyfordiversity.wildapricot.org/\nUnsubscribe",

    "body": "Hello, \nDo either of you care if for the quiz the bulk of the information for the questions goes in the chat? I was slightly concerned around timing and not feeling like I was speed talking through it. \u00a0I am highlighting what I will say out loud the rest would go in the chat.\nWould love feedback. \nThanks\n\u00a0\n0:19 to 0:23 (4 minutes = 3 minutes for quiz + 1 minute for debrief of Q1; note rest of questions debriefed on next slide)\nFAC B\nOPEN POLL 1: Let\u2019s do a quiz\u2026 (FACILITATOR: Quiz/Poll questions are in separate Word document in UTLE folder.)\nDebrief q#1 = 1 min\nSay: Here\u2019s a pop quiz about facts and history about the Latinx community in the U.S. No googling allowed.\n [Give people 3 minutes to complete quiz.]. \nAfter everyone is done with quiz, go through and debrief answers 1 by 1.\u00a0 \nQuiz question #1: People whose cultural background or heritage is Latin American prefer to identify as:\nThe answer is \u2018any of the above.\u2019 Different people prefer to identify differently.\u00a0 \nInoculate the question \u201cJust tell me what to call them\u201d by proactively bringing it up \u2013 \n\u00a0When in doubt, just ask the person, how do you identify?\nHispanic\n refers to \nlanguage \n\u2013 someone with origins in a Spanish speaking country. This includes Spain but not countries like Brazil (Portuguese) or Haiti (Haitian Creole- based largely on French).\n [If anyone asks: Belize (ENG), Guyana (ENG), Suriname (Dutch), and French Guiana (French)]. \nLatino/a\n relates to \ngeographic location\n \u2013 meaning a person whose country of origin is within Latin America (Central and South America and the Caribbean). This includes people with cultural background in the non-Spanish speaking countries like Brazil.\nLatinx\n is being used more and more, especially by younger people, as a gender-neutral word for Latino/a identity. It includes people of any gender or gender identity. \nChicano\n refers to Mexican-American heritage. It\u2019s also associated with the Mexican-American labor and civil rights movement of the 1960\u2019s and 70\u2019s. For many Mexican Americans, it connotes pride in a shared cultural, ethnic and community identity.\nCountry of origin:\n Many people prefer to identify not only as Latino or Hispanic, but also or primarily with their country of origin, e.g., as Guatemalan-American, Mexican-American, Venezuelan, or Cuban-American. \nOther: Boricua\n means Puerto Rican \u2013 it comes from the indigenous Puerto Ricans\u2019 name for the island: Borik\u00e9n or Borinquen. \nSpanish\n - Some people call Latinos \u201cSpanish\u201d \u2013 but what does Spanish mean? Right, that you\u2019re from Spain.\nI will be referring to American residents of Latin American origin interchangeably as Latinx, Latino, and Hispanic.\n\u00a0\nTransition\n: \nOkay, let\u2019s move on to q#2, what percent of the population identifies as Latinx? \nMOVE TO NEXT SLIDE TO DEBRIEF Q #2\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 LATINX image adapted from: \nhttps://www.elle.com/culture/career-politics/a38249/latinx-activists-roundtable/\n \n\u00a0\nDebrief remaining questions \u2013 provide answer key in a handout to save time\n2. Q2: The answer is (e). \nLatinos represent 18.7% of the U.S. population \nor about 62.1 million people (2020 census).\n \nOther answers\n: 12.4% Black non-Latino, 10.2% two or more races, 6% Asian, 1.1% Am Indian & Alaska Native (\nIf asked:\n .2% Hawaiian and Pacific Islander and 61.6% white)\n.\nSource: \nhttps://www.census.gov/library/visualizations/interactive/race-and-ethnicity-in-the-united-state-2010-and-2020-census.html\nLatinos are the largest U.S. minority and the 2nd fastest growing ethnic group (after Asians) in the US. The US Census predicts the Latino pop will reach almost 30% of the population by 2060.\nThis \ntable shows the countries of origin for different Latino groups in the US. \nFrom the most recent 2020 US Census.\nAs you can see people of Mexican origin represent the biggest group \u2013 \n61.5%\n / \n9.7% \nare Puerto Rican / Salvadoran and Cuban Latinos make up almost \n4% each\n / \n3.4%\n Dominican / \n2.7%\n Guatemalan/ Colombia 2%, Honduras 1.8%\n3. [Q5 in UTLE Quiz]. The first European language spoken in what is now the United States was: (a) English, (b) Dutch, (c) Portuguese, \n(d) Spanish,\n (e) French\n.\n\u00a0In 1565 - \nThe first permanent European settlement, Saint Augustine, Florida, is established in what is now the U.S. by Spanish admiral Pedro Men\u00e9ndez de Avil\u00e9s, \nintroducing Catholicism and the Spanish language to the nation\n. \nNote that this was 42 years \nbefore\n the first permanent English settlement, Jamestown, VA, was established 1607.\n\u00a0\n4. [Q7 in UTLE Quiz]. True or \nFalse:\n About 25% of the 500k-2 million Mexicans deported by the U.S. in the 1930\u2019s were American citizens. \nEXPLAIN: \nIn the prework that we have to prepare people for the full 4-hour Cultural Immersion, they have a chance to watch a short video and read some articles that include important history\u2014like this about the mass deportations of Mexicans and Mexican Americans from the U.S., that took place called the \n\u201cMexican Repatriation\u201d which took place during the Great Depression\n \n(1929-36).\nThe answer is False \u2013 the answer is 60%\n. (If anyone asks, the vast majority were birthright citizens). Latinos were widely \nblamed for exacerbating the overall economic consequences of the Great Depression.\nWhile supported by the federal government, \nmany of the deportations were largely organized and carried out by city and state governments, with support from private companies. For this reason it\u2019s nearly impossible to quantify the exact number of people who were deported.\nTransition\n: Let\u2019s watch a video to kick off some key historical events for Latinx in the U.S. \n============================================================================\nSources:\nhttps://www.nationalgeographic.com/magazine/2020/07/latinos-hispanic-power-america-immigration-future/\n2016 American Community Survey (HISPANIC OR LATINO BY SPECIFIC ORIGIN) - \nhttps://factfinder.census.gov/bkmk/table/1.0/en/ACS/16_1YR/B03001\n) \n\u00a0\n------------------------------------------------------\nTahitia Timmons\n(she/her/hers)\nSenior Consultant\nLCW \n100 S Saunders Rd, Suite 150\nLake Forest, IL 60045\n\u00a0 \n\u00a0\n \n\u00a0\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\nwww\n\u00a0\n|\n\u00a0\nTwitter\n \n|\n\u00a0\nFacebook\n\u00a0\n|\n\u00a0\nLinkedIn\n\u00a0\nFrom:\n Jake Pieczynski <j.pieczynski@lcwmail.com> \nSent:\n Tuesday, July 26, 2022 6:01 PM\nTo:\n Ada Vargas <a.vargas@lcwmail.com>; Tahitia Timmons <t.timmons@lcwmail.com>\nSubject:\n RE: Hispanic Heritage Event \n\u00a0\nGreat thank you both!

Can you please confirm? If we are not, then this is good to go & it can be signed.\n\u00a0\nI notice Alisa\u2019s name at the bottom. Typically, SOW owners sign SOWs. Alisa usually just signs MSAs. But if you want, Alisa can sign it. Not sure if this is a client request. \nIt is preferred that the client signs & sends to Alisa electronically for her signature.

You should use this when charging clients postponement and cancelation fees.\nThe new SOW includes additional language asking for PO info\nThe new SOW mentions 25% prepayment & thereafter rolling, monthly invoices at the start of each month\nNew language: \u201cPlease note this quote is valid for 30 days or until signed.\u201d\nNew language: \u201cAll review of content tailoring and/or customization includes two (2) rounds of reviews.\u201d This means that if you deliver something to a client, we are only allowing for 2 rounds of their reviews.

Can you please confirm? If we are not, then this is good to go & it can be signed.\n\u00a0\nI notice Alisa\u2019s name at the bottom. Typically, SOW owners sign SOWs. Alisa usually just signs MSAs.

I\u2019m sad we won\u2019t get to work together for long, but so excited for you to start this endeavor. There\u2019s lots to be done in the realm of Health Equity and I wish you the best of luck b/c we certainly need people who get it to lead the charge as it quite literally is a matter of life and death for so many folks! Again, let me know if I can be of help with JTI\u2014especially as you offload your clients and step into this transitionary period.

I hope that we can stay in touch.\u00a0\nI was just in a meeting talking about IDI stuff. Conner mentioned that you would like to observe Jeffrey doing a few 1:1 IDI debriefs? If so, I will start to contact the participants/client to see if they are okay with someone shadowing.\u00a0\nThanks,\nKaitlin",

As I mentioned they are moving away from the current eLearning model toward an LMS (soft launch end of Q4). I have these at 25 users and 6 months (they are not doing 12 months). \u00a0There were also price increases since the list you shared and I cannot override them BUT I was able to still have the 25% show up, however that is contingent on the prepay and 4+ and will no longer be available moving forward\nI am also enclosing a link to a zip folder with pdfs of the facilitated titles we discussed. \nThat is available here \nhttps://www.dropbox.com/l/AACk8tB0EdaazCqPPmltk1-8gcXTHuk8WVs\nPlease let me know that this opens and is viewable. \nHopefully this will assist you when you meet with the group on Monday. \nThanks and have a great weekend!\n\u00a0\nTahitia\n\u00a0\n------------------------------------------------------\nTahitia Timmons\n(she/her/hers)\nSenior Consultant\nLCW \n100 S Saunders Rd, Suite 150\nLake Forest, IL 60045\n\u00a0 \n\u00a0\n \n\u00a0\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\nwww\n\u00a0\n|\n\u00a0\nTwitter\n \n|\n\u00a0\nFacebook\n\u00a0\n|\n\u00a0\nLinkedIn",

We could not be happier for Tahitia\u2019s next chapter.\n\u00a0\nThe few months that Tahitia has been with LCW have been wonderful, and too short. She freely offered her unique perspective and her deep expertise internally and performed with considerable aplomb with our clients. She is knowledgeable, unflappable, and sharing. She contributed to our success by challenging the status quo and offering potential solutions based on her broad experiences in the field. She never critiqued a process or approach without also offering a different perspective as a way forward. That was always greatly appreciated.\n\u00a0\nTahitia will spend the next few weeks transitioning her work. More information will follow.\n\u00a0\nAlisa and I wish Tahitia the very best and are happy that her circumstances have presented her with this amazing opportunity, and we strongly support her striking out on her own.

We could not be happier for Tahitia\u2019s next chapter.\n\u00a0\nThe few months that Tahitia has been with LCW have been wonderful, and too short. She freely offered her unique perspective and her deep expertise internally and performed with considerable aplomb with our clients. She is knowledgeable, unflappable, and sharing. She contributed to our success by challenging the status quo and offering potential solutions based on her broad experiences in the field. She never critiqued a process or approach without also offering a different perspective as a way forward. That was always greatly appreciated.\n\u00a0\nTahitia will spend the next few weeks transitioning her work. More information will follow.\n\u00a0\nAlisa and I wish Tahitia the very best and are happy that her circumstances have presented her with this amazing opportunity, and we strongly support her striking out on her own. Please join us in congratulating Tahitia on this exciting move.\n\u00a0\nBest,\n\u00a0\nAlisa/Chuck\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n______________________________________\nChuck Adams\u00a0\nCo-CEO and Managing Principal\n\u00a0\nLCW\n100 South Saunders Rd, Suite 150\nLake Forest, IL 60045 USA\nOffice:\u00a0\n+1.773.938.4285\nMobile:\u00a0+1.630.373.5068\n\u00a0\nwww\n\u00a0:\u00a0\ntwitter\n\u00a0\n:\u00a0\nfacebook\n\u00a0\n:\u00a0\nlinkedin",

Upon review, it became clear that your shift in focus is an opportunity for LCW to craft a \nbespoke\n learning journey that will address individual leadership development needs and engage your Global Leadership Team to take measurable actions towards Clariant's desire to build a sustainable culture of inclusion. This approach will build self-awareness, create mutual understanding around inclusive leadership, and support DEI strategy and accountability. LCW is pleased to present the following recommendations:\n\u00a0\nIDI Individual Assessments & Individual Debriefs - $47,500\n8-Hour Inclusive Leadership Program\n \n- $105,000*\nLCW will leverage our proven senior leader agendas as a starting place to tailor material and co-create an upskilling journey that makes Clariant leaders feel more confident, comfortable, and knowledgeable on the subject and equips them to act as true advocates and champions. LCW recommends that all participants take the IDI \u00ae Assessment and receive the group IDI \u00ae debrief results during the Leadership Training Program. Participants will receive individualized results after the facilitated training to prepare for and align with the Leadership Coaching Clinic.\n2 Sessions - Virtual\n25 Participants per session\nIncludes Group IDI Debrief\nLeadership Coaching Clinic \u2013 $80,000*\nDuring this \nbespoke\n program, LCW will work with your Global Leadership Team to explore the role your executives and senior leaders must play to build a sustainable culture of inclusion. The coaching clinic will support your leadership team in individual and personalized development journeys. Participants will work to identify areas of upskilling and choose areas of focus by selecting from a list of curricula, which LCW will tailor to meet the Global Leadership Team's needs. For example, group coaching sessions may focus on gender or perhaps microaggressions. \nFour Cohorts\nEight weeks (4 sessions every other week) - Virtual\nFour \n1-2 hour\n sessions\nAccountability Partners\nFour growth assignments\nBespoke\n Action Planning Workshop \u2013 $33,500*\nUsing the IDI \u00ae and the Leadership Coaching Clinic as the framework, LCW will guide the Global Leadership Team through exercises that include reflection, commitment, and accountability. This session will align with Clariant's diversity, equity, and inclusion roadmap, which revolves around the following pillars Leadership Commitment, Building a Culture of Inclusion, Gender Equality, and Cultural Identity. Participants will leave the session with commitments to action items that support these initiatives, along with an understanding of the amount of effort required and the potential impacts of these efforts. It will also include \ngoal-setting\n and expectations. \n2-Hour Session - Virtual\n2-Facilitators\nIncorporates Growth Assignments from Coaching Clinic\nHyper-focused on Individual Leadership Action Planning and Strategic Planning\n\u00a0\n*The pricing reflects LCW's customization and revisions \nrates\n and consulting hours associated with the Scope of Work. Additional consulting hours are billed at an hourly rate. LCW commits to obtaining Clariant's approval before the start of work outlined in the agreement.\n\u00a0\nIn addition to the abovementioned costs, LCW will charge a \n10% Project Management Fee. \n\u00a0\nLCW's eagerness to partner with you on this journey has not waivered.

If we change this one, we will either need to have the voiceover talent rerecord (need to find out availability and cost) or we can remove all the audio pieces from the IDI interaction slides? \nThoughts?\n\u00a0 \nI believe removing the voice over from all is the best way to go.\n\u00a0\nSlide 5: Was this the suggested text we talked about:\nIt makes no difference to me if my \nteammates \nhave cultural differences \nshe is from the North or the South, single, married or divorced, thin or fat, black or white, or what religion she belongs to. She\u2019s one of us, and\n \nas long as we \nlet her know that, we \ncan all work together.\u00a0 \nThat could work, or here\u2019s what we\u2019ve used elsewhere: \u201cMy team members\u2019 cultural backgrounds don\u2019t make any difference to me.

If we change out the references, I do believe that we will also need to exclude or cut the red-marked audio as well.

If we change this one, we will either need to have the voiceover talent rerecord (need to find out availability and cost) or we can remove all the audio pieces from the IDI interaction slides? \nThoughts?\n\u00a0 \nI believe removing the voice over from all is the best way to go.\n\u00a0\nSlide 5: Was this the suggested text we talked about:\nIt makes no difference to me if my \nteammates \nhave cultural differences \nshe is from the North or the South, single, married or divorced, thin or fat, black or white, or what religion she belongs to. She\u2019s one of us, and\n \nas long as we \nlet her know that, we \ncan all work together.\u00a0 \nThat could work, or here\u2019s what we\u2019ve used elsewhere: \u201cMy team members\u2019 cultural backgrounds don\u2019t make any difference to me. We\u2019re part of the same team working toward the same business goals, and that\u2019s all we need to work well together\u201d\u00a0 \n\u00a0\n\u00a0\nOn \nslide 6\n, here is what I have written down\u2026\nMen and women often\n \nEmployees\n People \nmay analyze issues \ndifferently\n and communicate about them differently.\u00a0 I think a group can be more creative if these differences are put to good use.\n (intercultural)\u00a0 \nI would just use \u201cpeople\u201d vs \u201cemployees\u201d.\u00a0 We can also remove the extra \u201cdifferently\u201d\n\u00a0\nModule 5: Evaluating Talent\nFor the slide that references Kochman\u2019s work is the one shown below. If we change out the references, I do believe that we will also need to exclude or cut the red-marked audio as well. Please advise. \u00a0\u00a0\nYes, I agree.\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\nFrom:\n Tahitia Timmons <\nt.timmons@lcwmail.com\n> \nSent:\n Monday, July 11, 2022 11:06 AM\nTo:\n \nMarisa_Afzali@Progressive.com\nCc:\n Kelly Salek <\nk.salek@lcwmail.com\n>; Monica Marcel <\nm.marcel@lcwmail.com\n>\nSubject:\n Post conversation follow-up\n\u00a0\nHello Marisa, \nThank you for meeting with the team last week. As a newer consultant here at LCW I really appreciated learning about the relationship Progressive and LCW built along with your successes.\u00a0 Kudos on being named #1 on Forbes list of America\u2019s Best Employers for Diversity 2022! Interesting fact, LCW has worked with 2 of the 5 top companies on the list.\nWould you be able to reply to the areas highlighted in the table? Our goal is to have this done quickly, we are tentatively hoping by end of next week. \nI am off but will be monitoring emails as I know this is something your group would like to get completed ASAP. I will also be sending over an estimated quote/sow for the work by tomorrow. \nThank you \nTahitia\n\u00a0\nModule\nConcern\nSuggested change/recommendations\nManaging with Intercultural Competence\nSlide 5 - intercultural development continuum: Minimization example - \"It makes no difference to me if she's from the North or the South, single, married or divorced, black or white, or what religion she belongs to\" \nThe Progressive Team will share the language that they have used in other areas with the LCW team.\n \nSee above suggestion\nManaging with Intercultural Competence\nSlide 6:\u00a0 \"Men and women often analyze issues differently and communicate about them differently.\u00a0 I think a group can be more creative if these differences are put to good use\"\nThe Progressive Team will share the language that they have used in other areas with the LCW team.\n\u00a0 \nSee above suggestion\nEvaluating Talent\nPage 13: Insight highlights Thomas Kochman\u2019s work on \u201cBlack and White Styles in Conflict,\u201d \u2013 based on his research, Kochman states that \u201cblack and white Americans use two different communication styles for establishing the same goal of trust in communication: truth over peace and peace over truth.\u201d\u00a0 \nIt is part of the voiceover, and when the insight is clicked this shows\nLCW checking for replacement references\nLCW will update with new text and audio as needed\n*Marisa were there any concerns regarding the second reference which is about gender difference? We can look for a replacement there too if that would be helpful.\n\u00a0 \nGood catch, yes, probably so.\u00a0 If you can look at alternatives, that would be great\nProviding Opportunity\nPage 11: \n2nd example\u2013 \u201cWhen we hear dissent from someone from a different race, it provokes more thought than when it comes from someone of our race.\u201d - article citation from Scientific American, \u201cHow Diversity Made Us Smarter.\u201d Oct. 2014.\u00a0\u00a0 \n\u00a0\n4th example: \u201cThe groups with racial diversity significantly outperformed the group with no racial diversity.

We could not be happier for Tahitia\u2019s next chapter.\n\u00a0\nThe few months that Tahitia has been with LCW have been wonderful, and too short. She freely offered her unique perspective and her deep expertise internally and performed with considerable aplomb with our clients. She is knowledgeable, unflappable, and sharing. She contributed to our success by challenging the status quo and offering potential solutions based on her broad experiences in the field. She never critiqued a process or approach without also offering a different perspective as a way forward. That was always greatly appreciated.\n\u00a0\nTahitia will spend the next few weeks transitioning her work. More information will follow.\n\u00a0\nAlisa and I wish Tahitia the very best and are happy that her circumstances have presented her with this amazing opportunity, and we strongly support her striking out on her own.

We could not be happier for Tahitia\u2019s next chapter.\n\u00a0\nThe few months that Tahitia has been with LCW have been wonderful, and too short. She freely offered her unique perspective and her deep expertise internally and performed with considerable aplomb with our clients. She is knowledgeable, unflappable, and sharing. She contributed to our success by challenging the status quo and offering potential solutions based on her broad experiences in the field. She never critiqued a process or approach without also offering a different perspective as a way forward. That was always greatly appreciated.\n\u00a0\nTahitia will spend the next few weeks transitioning her work. More information will follow.\n\u00a0\nAlisa and I wish Tahitia the very best and are happy that her circumstances have presented her with this amazing opportunity, and we strongly support her striking out on her own.

I was not sure what best practice is here for this type of work. \nMy plan was to follow up with Nicole once I have your input. \u00a0Also do we want to just all get together briefly to walk Dan through this project? I gave him a semi high level overview of the request. \n\u00a0\nInvoicing and SOW\nFor this client I have in my notes we had not determined whether we were invoicing Danaher or Arlene - Redhouse Performance Consulting (RPC). \u00a0However, I see that Arlene has since requested we invoice Danaher directly during the time she is out (8 weeks). Nicole Wormley was checking to see if we were still \nactive in their system\n \u2013 we will need to verify that as I did not see an invoice in 2021.\u00a0 \n\u00a0\nDid you discuss any costs related to this project with Arlene? I know they want us to take over and do Session 3 of the program and work with Jason Butler at Danaher to support initiate the Latinx program and I can price those items out, but is there a price point we are staying within? This would help with writing that SOW. \n\u00a0\nLCW Actionable Request \nBlack Executive Sponsorship Program (Redhouse Performance Consulting, LLC)\nDevelop and anchor a panel discussion with Danaher Board Member Shane Sanders and a Black Female Executive (TBD).\nRequest is to have this lead by a Black female (LCW or collaborate an external pick) \nTarget delivery is mid/late 3Q.\u00a0 \nProgram format can be a hybrid live/virtual.\u00a0 \nLCW and at least one panelist is live; the other panelist(s) can have interviews pre-recorded.\u00a0 \nThe target audience are Danaher\u2019s senior executive leadership team members who are actively sponsoring mid-career Black executives.\u00a0 \nDeliver Two IDIs and debrief\nLatinx Executive Sponsorship Program \nAssist/Support the initiation of a similar rollout of the Latinx program which is being led by Sr. Director Corp D+I (Needs to be built or perhaps this is the CCLP with a look and feel like Redhouse\u2019s stuff since the plan is to hand this back to Arlene? \n\u00a0\nExecutive Coaching request\nChuck you were checking availability or the possibility of another Black male providing executive coaching for the Sr. Director Corp D+I.\u00a0 \u00a0\n\u00a0\nThank you \n\u00a0\n------------------------------------------------------\nTahitia Timmons\n(she/her/hers)\nSenior Consultant\nLCW \n100 S Saunders Rd, Suite 150\nLake Forest, IL 60045\n\u00a0 \n\u00a0\n \n\u00a0\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\nwww\n\u00a0\n|\n\u00a0\nTwitter\n \n|\n\u00a0\nFacebook\n\u00a0\n|\n\u00a0\nLinkedIn\n\u00a0\nFrom:\n Roane, Arlene <\narlene.roane@danaher.com\n> \nSent:\n Friday, July 8, 2022 2:16 PM\nTo:\n Chuck Adams <\nc.adams@lcwmail.com\n>; Tahitia Timmons <\nt.timmons@lcwmail.com\n>\nCc:\n Arlene Roane <\narlene@redhouse-performance.com\n>\nSubject:\n Re: DHR Exec Sponsorship Program & LCW \n\u00a0\nThank you for arranging your schedules to join today's call with Nicole.\u00a0 It was great meeting you Tahitia!\u00a0\u00a0\n\u00a0\nHere is the link to the DropBox containing the documents and content for the Black Associate Sponsorship Program.\u00a0\u00a0\nhttps://www.dropbox.com/sh/b538vz5r1g0w1td/AAA_y6brM9FrHmo-OdRNe8Lqa?dl=0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\nPlease ensure that you have access to the information.\u00a0 \u00a0I will be in the office Monday and until 12 noon on Tuesday.\n\u00a0\nEnjoy the weekend!\n\u00a0\nArlene R.\u00a0\nFrom:\n Chuck Adams <\nc.adams@lcwmail.com\n>\nSent:\n Monday, July 4, 2022 7:10 PM\nTo:\n Arlene Roane <\narlene@redhouse-performance.com\n>; Wormley, Nicole A <\nnicole.wormley@danaher.com\n>\nCc:\n Roane, Arlene <\narlene.roane@danaher.com\n>; Tahitia Timmons <\nt.timmons@lcwmail.com\n>\nSubject:\n RE: DHR Exec Sponsorship Program & LCW \n\u00a0\nThank you for the gracious introduction, Arlene.

Currently we do not have longer offerings as e-modules, just the shorter pieces of content.

If we change this one, we will either need to have the voiceover talent rerecord (need to find out availability and cost) or we can remove all the audio pieces from the IDI interaction slides? \nThoughts?\n\u00a0 \nI believe removing the voice over from all is the best way to go.\n\u00a0\nSlide 5: Was this the suggested text we talked about:\nIt makes no difference to me if my \nteammates \nhave cultural differences \nshe is from the North or the South, single, married or divorced, thin or fat, black or white, or what religion she belongs to. She\u2019s one of us, and\n \nas long as we \nlet her know that, we \ncan all work together.\u00a0 \nThat could work, or here\u2019s what we\u2019ve used elsewhere: \u201cMy team members\u2019 cultural backgrounds don\u2019t make any difference to me. We\u2019re part of the same team working toward the same business goals, and that\u2019s all we need to work well together\u201d\u00a0 \n\u00a0\n\u00a0\nOn \nslide 6\n, here is what I have written down\u2026\nMen and women often\n \nEmployees\n People \nmay analyze issues \ndifferently\n and communicate about them differently.\u00a0 I think a group can be more creative if these differences are put to good use.\n (intercultural)\u00a0 \nI would just use \u201cpeople\u201d vs \u201cemployees\u201d.\u00a0 We can also remove the extra \u201cdifferently\u201d\n\u00a0\nModule 5: Evaluating Talent\nFor the slide that references Kochman\u2019s work is the one shown below. If we change out the references, I do believe that we will also need to exclude or cut the red-marked audio as well.

If we change this one, we will either need to have the voiceover talent rerecord (need to find out availability and cost) or we can remove all the audio pieces from the IDI interaction slides? \nThoughts?\n\u00a0 \nI believe removing the voice over from all is the best way to go.\n\u00a0\nSlide 5: Was this the suggested text we talked about:\nIt makes no difference to me if my \nteammates \nhave cultural differences \nshe is from the North or the South, single, married or divorced, thin or fat, black or white, or what religion she belongs to. She\u2019s one of us, and\n \nas long as we \nlet her know that, we \ncan all work together.\u00a0 \nThat could work, or here\u2019s what we\u2019ve used elsewhere: \u201cMy team members\u2019 cultural backgrounds don\u2019t make any difference to me. We\u2019re part of the same team working toward the same business goals, and that\u2019s all we need to work well together\u201d\u00a0 \n\u00a0\n\u00a0\nOn \nslide 6\n, here is what I have written down\u2026\nMen and women often\n \nEmployees\n People \nmay analyze issues \ndifferently\n and communicate about them differently.\u00a0 I think a group can be more creative if these differences are put to good use.\n (intercultural)\u00a0 \nI would just use \u201cpeople\u201d vs \u201cemployees\u201d.\u00a0 We can also remove the extra \u201cdifferently\u201d\n\u00a0\nModule 5: Evaluating Talent\nFor the slide that references Kochman\u2019s work is the one shown below. If we change out the references, I do believe that we will also need to exclude or cut the red-marked audio as well.

If we change this one, we will either need to have the voiceover talent rerecord (need to find out availability and cost) or we can remove all the audio pieces from the IDI interaction slides? \nThoughts?\n\u00a0 \nI believe removing the voice over from all is the best way to go.\n\u00a0\nSlide 5: Was this the suggested text we talked about:\nIt makes no difference to me if my \nteammates \nhave cultural differences \nshe is from the North or the South, single, married or divorced, thin or fat, black or white, or what religion she belongs to. She\u2019s one of us, and\n \nas long as we \nlet her know that, we \ncan all work together.\u00a0 \nThat could work, or here\u2019s what we\u2019ve used elsewhere: \u201cMy team members\u2019 cultural backgrounds don\u2019t make any difference to me. We\u2019re part of the same team working toward the same business goals, and that\u2019s all we need to work well together\u201d\u00a0 \n\u00a0\n\u00a0\nOn \nslide 6\n, here is what I have written down\u2026\nMen and women often\n \nEmployees\n People \nmay analyze issues \ndifferently\n and communicate about them differently.\u00a0 I think a group can be more creative if these differences are put to good use.\n (intercultural)\u00a0 \nI would just use \u201cpeople\u201d vs \u201cemployees\u201d.\u00a0 We can also remove the extra \u201cdifferently\u201d\n\u00a0\nModule 5: Evaluating Talent\nFor the slide that references Kochman\u2019s work is the one shown below. If we change out the references, I do believe that we will also need to exclude or cut the red-marked audio as well.

At this point Thursday, 7/7: 11am-12pm CT is probably the best option so let me know if I should look at the second/third weeks of July too. \n1:1 Stakeholder Interviews\nScheduling\n: LCW working on time blocks. I also have a meeting with Lisa Moehlenkamp tomorrow to give her a heads up that we\u2019re starting to schedule. \nQuestions:\n FH/LCW to finalize questions. \nI know your team is working on those based on our conversation last week. \nTo Adrianne\u2019s point on the call, we think there are three \u201cthemes\u201d to these conversations: Personal commitment, accountability (for themselves and others) and I also think hearing their perspective on existing barriers or challenges that make it harder for them or their teams to make inclusion a priority, such as business demands from the firm. \nAlso, if there are any other themes that have emerged from the focus groups that we want to ask about, such as the point that Dan brought up about utilization, that is great too. \nI also gave this some thought so sharing some ideas below. \nWhat personal goals/commitments have you made as it relates to DE&I? Can you share an example of actions that have supported those commitments?\nAs a leader, how are you holding yourself accountable? How do you hold other leaders and managers on your team accountable?\nWhere does DE&I fit in with your other business priorities?\nWould love thoughts on this one. I think it\u2019s easy to say that DE&I is a priority but actually practicing that is more difficult. I think our focus on utilization is a great example. So I want to ask a question that digs into what DE&I being a priority looks like \nin action\n for these leaders beyond just\u00a0 \u201cvoicing support.\u201d \nFrom the GM deck: Which processes or policies limit or enhance a culture of inclusion and sense of belonging at FleishmanHillard?

If we change this one, we will either need to have the voiceover talent rerecord (need to find out availability and cost) or we can remove all the audio pieces from the IDI interaction slides? \nThoughts?\n\u00a0 \nI believe removing the voice over from all is the best way to go.\n\u00a0\nSlide 5: Was this the suggested text we talked about:\nIt makes no difference to me if my \nteammates \nhave cultural differences \nshe is from the North or the South, single, married or divorced, thin or fat, black or white, or what religion she belongs to. She\u2019s one of us, and\n \nas long as we \nlet her know that, we \ncan all work together.\u00a0 \nThat could work, or here\u2019s what we\u2019ve used elsewhere: \u201cMy team members\u2019 cultural backgrounds don\u2019t make any difference to me. We\u2019re part of the same team working toward the same business goals, and that\u2019s all we need to work well together\u201d\u00a0 \n\u00a0\n\u00a0\nOn \nslide 6\n, here is what I have written down\u2026\nMen and women often\n \nEmployees\n People \nmay analyze issues \ndifferently\n and communicate about them differently.\u00a0 I think a group can be more creative if these differences are put to good use.\n (intercultural)\u00a0 \nI would just use \u201cpeople\u201d vs \u201cemployees\u201d.\u00a0 We can also remove the extra \u201cdifferently\u201d\n\u00a0\nModule 5: Evaluating Talent\nFor the slide that references Kochman\u2019s work is the one shown below. If we change out the references, I do believe that we will also need to exclude or cut the red-marked audio as well. Please advise. \u00a0\u00a0\nYes, I agree.\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\nFrom:\n Tahitia Timmons <\nt.timmons@lcwmail.com\n> \nSent:\n Monday, July 11, 2022 11:06 AM\nTo:\n \nMarisa_Afzali@Progressive.com\nCc:\n Kelly Salek <\nk.salek@lcwmail.com\n>; Monica Marcel <\nm.marcel@lcwmail.com\n>\nSubject:\n Post conversation follow-up\n\u00a0\nHello Marisa, \nThank you for meeting with the team last week.

If we change this one, we will either need to have the voiceover talent rerecord (need to find out availability and cost) or we can remove all the audio pieces from the IDI interaction slides? \nThoughts?\n\u00a0 \nI believe removing the voice over from all is the best way to go.\n\u00a0\nSlide 5: Was this the suggested text we talked about:\nIt makes no difference to me if my \nteammates \nhave cultural differences \nshe is from the North or the South, single, married or divorced, thin or fat, black or white, or what religion she belongs to. She\u2019s one of us, and\n \nas long as we \nlet her know that, we \ncan all work together.\u00a0 \nThat could work, or here\u2019s what we\u2019ve used elsewhere: \u201cMy team members\u2019 cultural backgrounds don\u2019t make any difference to me. We\u2019re part of the same team working toward the same business goals, and that\u2019s all we need to work well together\u201d\u00a0 \n\u00a0\n\u00a0\nOn \nslide 6\n, here is what I have written down\u2026\nMen and women often\n \nEmployees\n People \nmay analyze issues \ndifferently\n and communicate about them differently.\u00a0 I think a group can be more creative if these differences are put to good use.\n (intercultural)\u00a0 \nI would just use \u201cpeople\u201d vs \u201cemployees\u201d.\u00a0 We can also remove the extra \u201cdifferently\u201d\n\u00a0\nModule 5: Evaluating Talent\nFor the slide that references Kochman\u2019s work is the one shown below. If we change out the references, I do believe that we will also need to exclude or cut the red-marked audio as well. Please advise. \u00a0\u00a0\nYes, I agree.\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\nFrom:\n Tahitia Timmons <\nt.timmons@lcwmail.com\n> \nSent:\n Monday, July 11, 2022 11:06 AM\nTo:\n \nMarisa_Afzali@Progressive.com\nCc:\n Kelly Salek <\nk.salek@lcwmail.com\n>; Monica Marcel <\nm.marcel@lcwmail.com\n>\nSubject:\n Post conversation follow-up\n\u00a0\nHello Marisa, \nThank you for meeting with the team last week.

I was hopeful maybe we could pick your brain if you had time over the next couple of weeks. \nLCW also has some great e-content that with some tweaks could meet some of the Nursing groups DEI & Health Equity work, which could also be a future opportunity. \nThank you, hopefully this will be a fruitful intro for everyone. \nTahitia\n\u00a0\n------------------------------------------------------\nTahitia Timmons\n(she/her/hers)\nSenior Consultant\nLCW \n100 S Saunders Rd, Suite 150\nLake Forest, IL 60045\n\u00a0 \n\u00a0\n \n\u00a0\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\nwww\n\u00a0\n|\n\u00a0\nTwitter\n \n|\n\u00a0\nFacebook\n\u00a0\n|\n\u00a0\nLinkedIn",

At this point Thursday, 7/7: 11am-12pm CT is probably the best option so let me know if I should look at the second/third weeks of July too. \n1:1 Stakeholder Interviews\nScheduling\n: LCW working on time blocks. I also have a meeting with Lisa Moehlenkamp tomorrow to give her a heads up that we\u2019re starting to schedule. \nQuestions:\n FH/LCW to finalize questions. \nI know your team is working on those based on our conversation last week. \nTo Adrianne\u2019s point on the call, we think there are three \u201cthemes\u201d to these conversations: Personal commitment, accountability (for themselves and others) and I also think hearing their perspective on existing barriers or challenges that make it harder for them or their teams to make inclusion a priority, such as business demands from the firm. \nAlso, if there are any other themes that have emerged from the focus groups that we want to ask about, such as the point that Dan brought up about utilization, that is great too. \nI also gave this some thought so sharing some ideas below. \nWhat personal goals/commitments have you made as it relates to DE&I? Can you share an example of actions that have supported those commitments?\nAs a leader, how are you holding yourself accountable? How do you hold other leaders and managers on your team accountable?\nWhere does DE&I fit in with your other business priorities?\nWould love thoughts on this one. I think it\u2019s easy to say that DE&I is a priority but actually practicing that is more difficult. I think our focus on utilization is a great example. So I want to ask a question that digs into what DE&I being a priority looks like \nin action\n for these leaders beyond just\u00a0 \u201cvoicing support.\u201d \nFrom the GM deck: Which processes or policies limit or enhance a culture of inclusion and sense of belonging at FleishmanHillard? What is working or not working?\nDE&I Certification Exploratory Conversation: Confirmed for 6/30\n\u00a0\nLMK if there is anything I missed. \n\u00a0\nThanks!\nRachel \n\u00a0\nRachel Coleman (She/Her)\nVice President \n|\n \nReputation \nFleishmanHillard\n \n|\n \n225 N.

LCW is looking at expanding their e-learnings and currently investigating different models regarding pricing and best practices. I know that the nursing group has been a leader in e-content for a while and that you have been the big driver for that success. I was hopeful maybe we could pick your brain if you had time over the next couple of weeks. \nLCW also has some great e-content that with some tweaks could meet some of the Nursing groups DEI & Health Equity work, which could also be a future opportunity. \nThank you, hopefully this will be a fruitful intro for everyone. \nTahitia\n\u00a0\n------------------------------------------------------\nTahitia Timmons\n(she/her/hers)\nSenior Consultant\nLCW \n100 S Saunders Rd, Suite 150\nLake Forest, IL 60045\n\u00a0 \n\u00a0\n \n\u00a0\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\nwww\n\u00a0\n|\n\u00a0\nTwitter\n \n|\n\u00a0\nFacebook\n\u00a0\n|\n\u00a0\nLinkedIn",
