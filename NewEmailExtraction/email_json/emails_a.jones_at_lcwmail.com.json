Today, following many months of hard work and commitment from our team, coupled with incredible loyalty and support from all of you, \nI'm proud and delighted to share that we have now completed this global restructuring.\nWe've successfully strengthened our real estate portfolio around the world, and have received Court approval to emerge from the Chapter 11 process in the U.S. and Canada. We expect to emerge following the completion of routine administrative matters mid-June, which you can read more about \nhere\n and find additional information about \nhere\n.\nWe're grateful that you continue to choose us as your trusted workspace provider. While we've had to make some very difficult decisions throughout this process, I am confident that we have firmly established a strong foundation for a sustainable and exciting future at WeWork. A future that empowers us to invest in our products and services and provide innovative workplace solutions - all while growing responsibly far into the future.\nWhen asked to take on the role of CEO one year ago, I accepted without hesitation because I knew that WeWork offered a unique experience well beyond our physical workspaces. Spending just one day in a WeWork, no matter where you are in the world, one immediately understands what makes our company special: our community.\nIt is not an understatement to say that we have never been more confident in our ability to deliver best-in-class services and products so that you can do your best work. To our entire community, on behalf of the WeWork team, thank you, sincerely, for your patience and support as we have navigated a uniquely challenging year. With this work now behind us, we look forward to delivering for you in the months and years ahead.\nWith gratitude,\nDavid Tolley\nChief Executive Officer\nWeWork\n\u00a0\n \n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\nRefer friends\n | \nDownload the WeWork App\n \nUnsubscribe\n | \nTerms\n | \nPrivacy \n| \nView in a browser\nThis email was sent from \nWeWork\n12 East 49th Street, Floor 3 New York, NY, 10017 US",

As part of this effort, we worked to renegotiate nearly all of our real estate leases globally, to reach sustainable economic terms and enable our business to best serve you and our other members far into the future.\nI am excited to share that we have officially completed our lease portfolio review in Chicago.\nWith the support of our landlord partners and a continuing portfolio of our strongest locations, WeWork is now better positioned to operate in Chicago for the long term and is one step closer to emerging from Chapter 11 by the end of May. \nOn behalf of the entire WeWork team, we are truly grateful for your patience as we have navigated this process, and that you continue to choose to be part of our community. As we move forward, our team\u2019s undivided attention is on ensuring we continue to deliver best-in-class member experiences to you. \nFor more information on this announcement, please \nvisit our newsroom post. \nWe look forward to being your trusted workplace provider in Chicago for many years to come. \nWith gratitude,\nDavid Tolley\nChief Executive Officer\n\u00a0\n \n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\nRefer friends\n | \nDownload the WeWork App\n \n\u00a0\nTerms\n | \nPrivacy \n| \nView in a browser\nThis email was sent from \nWeWork\n12 East 49th Street, Floor 3 New York, NY, 10017 US",

    "body": "You don't often get email from marketing@charcap.com. \nLearn why this is important\n\u00a0\n \nAmerica's Leading Invoice Factoring Company for More Than 20 Years\n \n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \n6 Success-Amplifying Small Business Skills Anyone Can Master\nInvesting in developing your small business skills is one of the best ways to support your company. Below, we\u2019ll walk you through some of the most critical areas to focus on.\n\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \n1. Financial Management Skills\nAn estimated 82 percent of business failures can be traced back to poor cash flow management, according to the National Federation of Independent Business (NFIB). Business owners must know how to predict cash flow accurately, budget accordingly, and identify working capital options before cash is needed.\n2. Customer Service, Marketing, and Sales Skills\nMany people view customer service, marketing, and sales as wholly different things. While they are typically managed independently, no area can perform at its peak unless the other areas are strong.\u00a0 \n3. Communication Skills\nBusiness communication skills come into play whether you\u2019re asking a customer to place their next order or smoothing out employee concerns. Spend time chatting with employees and study negotiation techniques to level up.\n4. Management and Leadership Skills\nAlthough management and leadership skills are often thought of as interchangeable, they\u2019re quite different in practice. \u201cManagement is doing things right; leadership is doing the right things,\u201d as Peter Drucker said. One is process-oriented, and the other is inspiration-oriented. \n5. Planning and Problem-Solving Skills\nYou constantly use problem-solving skills throughout the day. Use puzzles to boost your abilities and bring your staff together around activities like escape rooms for the extra team-building benefit. \n6. Networking Skills\nDeveloping networking skills will expose you to new opportunities and help you build connections that can help your business grow. Plus, it can help eliminate the sense of isolation business owners often feel.\nBuild Your Small Business Skills with Help from Charter Capital\nBuilding your business acumen skills can be fun, and you can do it over time. If a lack of working capital prevents you from seizing an opportunity to learn, invoice factoring can provide you with the cash you need to upskill and strengthen your business. To learn more or get started, \nrequest a free rate quote from Charter Capital\n.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \nREQUEST A QUOTE \n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \nExpand Your Business with Help from Charter Capital\nCharter Capital makes it easy to secure capital when you need it most. Use your factoring cash to fund growth initiatives right away, or simply be prepared in case your business needs a quick cash injection later.\u00a0\nTo learn more or get started, request a complimentary factoring quote from Charter Capital.\u00a0\nFollow Us On\n \n \n \n \n \n\u00a0\u00a0\nCopyright \u00a9 2024 Charter Capital\u00a0\nHoldings LP, All rights reserved\u00a0\n6750 West Loop South, Suite 1010 Bellaire, TX 77401 | +1-855-645-1639\nIf you'd like to stop receiving these messages, \nunsubscribe",

As always, the \nsafety of our customers and their property\n is top of mind. Here are some important practical steps you can take to help protect your property during extreme cold\u00a0weather. \n\u00a0 \n \n\u00a0 \nPipe Bursts \n\u00a0 \n\u00a0 \nEnsuring adequate heat and monitoring facilities are important steps. Our research indicates frozen pipes cause some of the most common and costliest cold weather claims (>$18K, on average). Not surprisingly, the risk of pipe bursts can increase when businesses are closed or unoccupied (e.g., due to storm closings). From schools whose students are out on break (and leave windows open) to businesses that close for a weekend, we\u2019ve seen some very disruptive losses when pipes freeze and water flows \u2013 sometimes for days before being\u00a0noticed. \n\u00a0 \n \n\u00a0\nSlip & Falls \n\u00a0\n\u00a0 \nSlip and fall accidents can be very impactful to your business, whether they involve your employees or someone else legally on your premises. Each year these accidents result in thousands of workers\u2019 compensation or third party liability claims. In fact, slip and falls account for approximately 1/3 of our workers\u2019 compensation and general liability\u00a0claims. \n\u00a0 \nThis risk can increase substantially with winter weather.

You\u2019ve been on a journey to put in place some of the recommendations from that project, as well as integrating DEIB into your HR strategy. \nThere\u2019s been tremendous transformation and change at Unilever in the past year, including how it operates as an organization and a new CEO, Hein Schumacher. \nUnilever is\u00a0 moving to more performance-based structure, developing \u201cUnilever behaviors\u201d and new standards of leadership. \nRelationship with LCW was paused, while all of this change and foundation work was being done. \n\u00a0\nDriving DEI at Unilever NA in 2024\nIt\u2019s a priority at Unilever to develop a sustainable method for cultural competency. \nLCW\u2019s identity-centered Spotlights are 1-hr, scalable virtual facilitated sessions that can provide cultural competence around different cultural groups. Facilitated by \u2018cultural insider\u2019 experts, the Spotlights are underpinned by the experiences and influences that are shared by members of a community (both struggles and achievements), and the values and behaviors that are prioritized as a result (especially in the workplace). \nUnilever is interested in LCW facilitating Spotlights throughout 2024, in partnership with its ERG\u2019s. \nTo make the learnings sustainable and \u2018sticky\u2019, you envision a facilitated conversation immediately following each Spotlight, to discuss what was learned and to make connections and applications to the workplace. LCW can create a facilitator/conversation guide, that Unilever leaders/managers can use to structure these conversations. \nUnilever is interested in recording the Spotlight sessions, for review by folks who are not able to attend any given Spotlight in 2024 (as long as participants\u2019 personal sharing is not included). We can continue conversations about this, including what a site license agreement would look like. \nUnilever will structure its internal communications/marketing about the Spotlights around gaining attendance from allies, versus members of the communities (though they are invited too, of course!). You will frame them as learning opportunities for employees who are \nnot\n members of the community who want to understand and connect with this community more deeply.\nThe Spotlights will be rolled out and delivered in 2024 in parallel with unconscious bias training. \nThe first session will be \u201cSpotlight on the Black/African American Community\u201d in February 2024.\nLCW is working on creating two additional Spotlights, one about the Jewish Community and one about the Muslim Community. We\u2019ll keep you updated on progress on these. \nIt\u2019s important that all Spotlights are inclusive of the Canadian perspective and avoid being U.S.-centric. LCW is able to have some of them facilitated by a Canadian facilitator.\nHere is a recap of currently available Spotlights:\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\nSpotlight on\u2026\nSuggested Delivery Month in 2024\nPer individual workshop\nPer workshop when purchased in bundle \n(-20%)\n1\nBlack/African American Community\nFebruary (Black History Month)\n$3,000\n$2400\n2\nWomen in Leadership\u00a0\nMarch (Women\u2019s History Month)\n\u00a0\n$3,000\n$2400\n3\nBeing an Ally for the Asian American Community\u00a0\nMay (AAPI Heritage Month)\n$4,500\n(2 facilitators)\n$3600\n4\nThe LGBTQ+ Community\u00a0\nJune (LGBTQ+ Pride Month)\n$3,000\n$2400\n5\nPersons with Disabilities\u00a0\nJuly (Disability Pride Month)\n$3,000\n$2400\n6\nThe Hispanic/Latinx/e Community\u00a0\nSeptember (Hispanic Heritage Month)\n$3,000\n$2400\n7\nIndigenous People in North America\u00a0\nOctober (Indigenous Peoples\u2019 Day) or November (Native American Heritage Month)\n$4,500\n(2 facilitators)\n$3600\n8\nU.S. Veterans\u00a0Community\nNovember (Veterans\u2019 Day)\n$3,000\n$2400\n9\nU.S. Generations\nDecember (Or April or August)\n$3,000\n$2400\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\nTOTAL\n$30K\n$24K\n\u00a0\nAdditional Workshops & Learning Opportunities:\nManeshi asked about the \u201cBuilding Executive Presence for a Diverse Group of Leaders\u201d workshop.

Please let us know if there\u2019s anything else you need from us in the interim. \n\u00a0\nFrom our perspective, next steps would be:\nLCW with Unilever to finalize the scope of the work, including Spotlights, tailoring to ensure inclusion of Canadian perspective, post-Spotlight conversation facilitator guide, and rough schedule. \nLCW to draw up a Statement of Work, which would be sent to you for signature\nBeginning of work!\n\u00a0\nWe very much look forward to our partnership in 2024.\n\u00a0\nBest, \nRebecca and the LCW Team\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\nRebecca M.

Reaching our decision has been a long process, and we respectfully ask for a few more days. In the journey of interviewing and deliberating over various companies, we have concluded that we need to work with two Diversity, Equity, Inclusion, and Belonging (DEIB) providers. This represents a shift from our original belief that one company could provide all we needed. Having decided that we need two providers, we will now hire for two positions:\n1)\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\nA\u00a0\nDEIB Leadership Team Provider\u00a0\nwill provide the guidance and mentorship required by our organization\u2019s leadership team, and a\n2)\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\nDEIB Training and Facilitation Provider\n\u00a0will provide training to SDSN\u2019s staff members .\nWe have tentatively selected the\n\u00a0DEIB Leadership Team Provider\n. We believe that\u00a0LCW\u00a0is a strong candidate for the\u00a0\nDEIB Training and Facilitation Provider.\u00a0\n If you remain interested, please\u00a0translate the preliminary proposal you submitted to SDSN some weeks ago into a detailed work plan by weeks and by the topics that will be covered in your DEIB training and facilitation sessions for SDSN. Be aware that many on the SDSN DEIB Committee found it difficult to envision the flow of the training and its general content.\n\u00a0\n\u00a0For the proposed proposal, please bear in mind the following points:\n1)\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\nThe audience for the\u00a0\nDEIB Training Facilitation Provider\n\u00a0training will comprise about 60\u201380 SDSN personnel, including both SDSN leadership and staff members. Most participants will be from the USA and France with some from Malaysia.\n2)\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\nThe assumed total price point is $25,000 for several weeks of online training, with at least one facilitated training and follow-up provided over the complete duration of the training.\n3)\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\nOur training needs remain the same, that is, online training(s) for up to 60\u201380 staff members that addresses the unconscious biases that stand in the way of our ability to foster an inclusive work culture and community; lead to discrimination against anyone who is different, including anyone under the\u00a0\ntransgender umbrella (encompassing binary and nonbinary trans people); increases the feeling of psychological peril, or limit the access of people with disabilities to our workspaces and resources\n.\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\nPlease free to contact us with any questions you may have.\n\u00a0\nSincerely,\n\u00a0\nLucia.\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n-- \nDr. Lucia Rodriguez\nDirector, Master's in Development Practice (MDP) Program Secretariat\nSustainable Development Goals (SDG)-Academy Division\n\u00a0\nSustainable Development Solutions Network (SDSN)\n475 Riverside Drive\nSuite 530\nNew York, New York 10115\n\u00a0\nlucia.rodriguez@unsdsn.org\n\u00a0\nLearn more about the MDP here,\nwww.mdpglobal.org\n\u00a0\nLearn more about SDSN here,\nwww.unsdsn.org\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n-- \nDr. Lucia Rodriguez\nDirector, Master's in Development Practice (MDP) Program Secretariat\nSustainable Development Goals (SDG)-Academy Division\n\u00a0\nSustainable Development Solutions Network (SDSN)\n475 Riverside Drive\nSuite 530\nNew York, New York 10115\n\u00a0\nlucia.rodriguez@unsdsn.org\n\u00a0\nLearn more about the MDP here,\nwww.mdpglobal.org\n\u00a0\nLearn more about SDSN here,\nwww.unsdsn.org\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n-- \nDr. Lucia Rodriguez\nDirector, Master's in Development Practice (MDP) Program Secretariat\nSustainable Development Goals (SDG)-Academy Division\n\u00a0\nSustainable Development Solutions Network (SDSN)\n475 Riverside Drive\nSuite 530\nNew York, New York 10115\n\u00a0\nlucia.rodriguez@unsdsn.org\n\u00a0\nLearn more about the MDP here,\nwww.mdpglobal.org\n\u00a0\nLearn more about SDSN here,\nwww.unsdsn.org\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n-- \nDr. Lucia Rodriguez\nDirector, Master's in Development Practice (MDP) Program Secretariat\nSustainable Development Goals (SDG)-Academy Division\n\u00a0\nSustainable Development Solutions Network (SDSN)\n475 Riverside Drive\nSuite 530\nNew York, New York 10115\n\u00a0\nlucia.rodriguez@unsdsn.org\n\u00a0\nLearn more about the MDP here,\nwww.mdpglobal.org\n\u00a0\nLearn more about SDSN here,\nwww.unsdsn.org\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n-- \nStacey Clark\nVice President of Operations\nSustainable Development Solutions Network\nPronouns: she/her\nM:\u00a0\n+1-917-592-4546\nstacey.clark@unsdsn.org\nwww.unsdsn.org\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\u00a0\n\u00a0\n-- \nDr. Lucia Rodriguez\nDirector, Master's in Development Practice (MDP) Program Secretariat\nSustainable Development Goals (SDG)-Academy Division\n\u00a0\nSustainable Development Solutions Network (SDSN)\n475 Riverside Drive\nSuite 530\nNew York, New York 10115\n\u00a0\nlucia.rodriguez@unsdsn.org\n\u00a0\nLearn more about the MDP here,\nwww.mdpglobal.org\n\u00a0\nLearn more about SDSN here,\nwww.unsdsn.org\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n-- \nDr. Lucia Rodriguez\nDirector, Master's in Development Practice (MDP) Program Secretariat\nSustainable Development Goals (SDG)-Academy Division\n\u00a0\nSustainable Development Solutions Network (SDSN)\n475 Riverside Drive\nSuite 530\nNew York, New York 10115\n\u00a0\nlucia.rodriguez@unsdsn.org\n\u00a0\nLearn more about the MDP here,\nwww.mdpglobal.org\n\u00a0\nLearn more about SDSN here,\nwww.unsdsn.org",

You\u2019ve been on a journey to put in place some of the recommendations from that project, as well as integrating DEIB into your HR strategy. \nThere\u2019s been tremendous transformation and change at Unilever in the past year, including how it operates as an organization and a new CEO, Hein Schumacher. \nUnilever is\u00a0 moving to more performance-based structure, developing \u201cUnilever behaviors\u201d and new standards of leadership. \nRelationship with LCW was paused, while all of this change and foundation work was being done. \n\u00a0\nDriving DEI at Unilever NA in 2024\nIt\u2019s a priority at Unilever to develop a sustainable method for cultural competency. \nLCW\u2019s identity-centered Spotlights are 1-hr, scalable virtual facilitated sessions that can provide cultural competence around different cultural groups. Facilitated by \u2018cultural insider\u2019 experts, the Spotlights are underpinned by the experiences and influences that are shared by members of a community (both struggles and achievements), and the values and behaviors that are prioritized as a result (especially in the workplace). \nUnilever is interested in LCW facilitating Spotlights throughout 2024, in partnership with its ERG\u2019s. \nTo make the learnings sustainable and \u2018sticky\u2019, you envision a facilitated conversation immediately following each Spotlight, to discuss what was learned and to make connections and applications to the workplace. LCW can create a facilitator/conversation guide, that Unilever leaders/managers can use to structure these conversations. \nUnilever is interested in recording the Spotlight sessions, for review by folks who are not able to attend any given Spotlight in 2024 (as long as participants\u2019 personal sharing is not included). We can continue conversations about this, including what a site license agreement would look like. \nUnilever will structure its internal communications/marketing about the Spotlights around gaining attendance from allies, versus members of the communities (though they are invited too, of course!). You will frame them as learning opportunities for employees who are \nnot\n members of the community who want to understand and connect with this community more deeply.\nThe Spotlights will be rolled out and delivered in 2024 in parallel with unconscious bias training. \nThe first session will be \u201cSpotlight on the Black/African American Community\u201d in February 2024.\nLCW is working on creating two additional Spotlights, one about the Jewish Community and one about the Muslim Community. We\u2019ll keep you updated on progress on these. \nIt\u2019s important that all Spotlights are inclusive of the Canadian perspective and avoid being U.S.-centric. LCW is able to have some of them facilitated by a Canadian facilitator.\nHere is a recap of currently available Spotlights:\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\nSpotlight on\u2026\nSuggested Delivery Month in 2024\nPer individual workshop\nPer workshop when purchased in bundle \n(-20%)\n1\nBlack/African American Community\nFebruary (Black History Month)\n$3,000\n$2400\n2\nWomen in Leadership\u00a0\nMarch (Women\u2019s History Month)\n\u00a0\n$3,000\n$2400\n3\nBeing an Ally for the Asian American Community\u00a0\nMay (AAPI Heritage Month)\n$4,500\n(2 facilitators)\n$3600\n4\nThe LGBTQ+ Community\u00a0\nJune (LGBTQ+ Pride Month)\n$3,000\n$2400\n5\nPersons with Disabilities\u00a0\nJuly (Disability Pride Month)\n$3,000\n$2400\n6\nThe Hispanic/Latinx/e Community\u00a0\nSeptember (Hispanic Heritage Month)\n$3,000\n$2400\n7\nIndigenous People in North America\u00a0\nOctober (Indigenous Peoples\u2019 Day) or November (Native American Heritage Month)\n$4,500\n(2 facilitators)\n$3600\n8\nU.S. Veterans\u00a0Community\nNovember (Veterans\u2019 Day)\n$3,000\n$2400\n9\nU.S. Generations\nDecember (Or April or August)\n$3,000\n$2400\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\nTOTAL\n$30K\n$24K\n\u00a0\nAdditional Workshops & Learning Opportunities:\nManeshi asked about the \u201cBuilding Executive Presence for a Diverse Group of Leaders\u201d workshop.

Please let us know if there\u2019s anything else you need from us in the interim. \n\u00a0\nFrom our perspective, next steps would be:\nLCW with Unilever to finalize the scope of the work, including Spotlights, tailoring to ensure inclusion of Canadian perspective, post-Spotlight conversation facilitator guide, and rough schedule. \nLCW to draw up a Statement of Work, which would be sent to you for signature\nBeginning of work!\n\u00a0\nWe very much look forward to our partnership in 2024.\n\u00a0\nBest, \nRebecca and the LCW Team\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\nRebecca M.

We do have a library of miniworkshops, which includes topics beyond the Spotlights (please see attached). Finally, we offer a variety of workshops on other DEI topics, we can talk about those when we meet. \n\u00a0\nAnd yes, for many of our sessions we incorporate Canadian perspectives, and for those that we haven\u2019t yet, we\u00a0 most certainly can.\n\u00a0\nLooking forward to our discussion as well. \n\u00a0\nRebecca\n\u00a0\nRebecca M.

Further to our recent communication regarding an increase in telephone scams by which fraudsters impersonating financial institutions trick their victims into disclosing confidential information, we also would like to inform you about another emerging trend. We have recently identified an increase in the number of incidents whereby fraudsters instruct their intended victims to visit websites and enter their confidential online banking information, including passwords, to cancel a purported fraudulent transaction on their account. Although these websites are made to look very similar to the actual website of their bank, they are fraudulent sites that have been designed to trick their victims into believing they are their bank's websites. \n\u200b\nPlease remain vigilant and look for common red flags. Citi will \nnever\n ask you to: \n\u200b\n\u2022\nShare a password, One-Time Passcode, or token code\n\u200b\n\u2022\nClick on a link or visit a specific website and enter your confidential information to cancel a fraudulent transaction\n\u200b\n\u2022\nLog into your banking platform, such as CitiBusiness\n\u00ae\n Online, and transfer money to a new bank account.\n\u200b\n\u2022\nGrant it remote access to your computer or any of your devices.\n\u200b\nPlease be mindful to treat any unwanted calls or online communications with caution, even if they appear to be from a known business contact or reputable organization. \n\u200b\nIf you receive any suspicious or suspect calls, we recommend you employ the following best practices: \n\u200b\n\u200b\n\u2022\nStay calm. Fraudsters intentionally create stressful and time-sensitive scenarios to try and pressure their victims into acting quickly, which may include disclosing sensitive information.\n\u200b\n\u2022\nDo not allow the caller to rush you, it is important that you stay in control and recognize the possibility that the person calling you is a fraudster.\n\u200b\n\u2022\nDo not disclose personal information to anyone that you do not know or recognize.\n\u200b\n\u2022\nPlease remember, you can only access Citi Commercial websites through the below web addresses:\nhttps://businessaccess.citibank.citigroup.com\nhttps://commercialbanking.citidirect.com\n\u200b\n\u2022\nIf something doesn't feel right, terminate the call and immediately contact your Citi representative. Do not use any contact details (telephone numbers, websites, or email addresses) provided by the suspicious caller.\n\u200b\nPlease feel free to reach out to your Citi representative with any questions, and visit our \nFraud Prevention\n website to learn more about how to help protect your business against fraud. \n\u200b\n\u200b\nCommercial Bank\n \n\u200b\n\u00a9 2023 Citigroup Inc.

You\u2019ve been on a journey to put in place some of the recommendations from that project, as well as integrating DEIB into your HR strategy. \nThere\u2019s been tremendous transformation and change at Unilever in the past year, including how it operates as an organization and a new CEO, Hein Schumacher. \nUnilever is\u00a0 moving to more performance-based structure, developing \u201cUnilever behaviors\u201d and new standards of leadership. \nRelationship with LCW was paused, while all of this change and foundation work was being done. \n\u00a0\nDriving DEI at Unilever NA in 2024\nIt\u2019s a priority at Unilever to develop a sustainable method for cultural competency. \nLCW\u2019s identity-centered Spotlights are 1-hr, scalable virtual facilitated sessions that can provide cultural competence around different cultural groups. Facilitated by \u2018cultural insider\u2019 experts, the Spotlights are underpinned by the experiences and influences that are shared by members of a community (both struggles and achievements), and the values and behaviors that are prioritized as a result (especially in the workplace). \nUnilever is interested in LCW facilitating Spotlights throughout 2024, in partnership with its ERG\u2019s. \nTo make the learnings sustainable and \u2018sticky\u2019, you envision a facilitated conversation immediately following each Spotlight, to discuss what was learned and to make connections and applications to the workplace. LCW can create a facilitator/conversation guide, that Unilever leaders/managers can use to structure these conversations. \nUnilever is interested in recording the Spotlight sessions, for review by folks who are not able to attend any given Spotlight in 2024 (as long as participants\u2019 personal sharing is not included). We can continue conversations about this, including what a site license agreement would look like. \nUnilever will structure its internal communications/marketing about the Spotlights around gaining attendance from allies, versus members of the communities (though they are invited too, of course!). You will frame them as learning opportunities for employees who are \nnot\n members of the community who want to understand and connect with this community more deeply.\nThe Spotlights will be rolled out and delivered in 2024 in parallel with unconscious bias training. \nThe first session will be \u201cSpotlight on the Black/African American Community\u201d in February 2024.\nLCW is working on creating two additional Spotlights, one about the Jewish Community and one about the Muslim Community. We\u2019ll keep you updated on progress on these. \nIt\u2019s important that all Spotlights are inclusive of the Canadian perspective and avoid being U.S.-centric. LCW is able to have some of them facilitated by a Canadian facilitator.\nHere is a recap of currently available Spotlights:\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\nSpotlight on\u2026\nSuggested Delivery Month in 2024\nPer individual workshop\nPer workshop when purchased in bundle \n(-20%)\n1\nBlack/African American Community\nFebruary (Black History Month)\n$3,000\n$2400\n2\nWomen in Leadership\u00a0\nMarch (Women\u2019s History Month)\n\u00a0\n$3,000\n$2400\n3\nBeing an Ally for the Asian American Community\u00a0\nMay (AAPI Heritage Month)\n$4,500\n(2 facilitators)\n$3600\n4\nThe LGBTQ+ Community\u00a0\nJune (LGBTQ+ Pride Month)\n$3,000\n$2400\n5\nPersons with Disabilities\u00a0\nJuly (Disability Pride Month)\n$3,000\n$2400\n6\nThe Hispanic/Latinx/e Community\u00a0\nSeptember (Hispanic Heritage Month)\n$3,000\n$2400\n7\nIndigenous People in North America\u00a0\nOctober (Indigenous Peoples\u2019 Day) or November (Native American Heritage Month)\n$4,500\n(2 facilitators)\n$3600\n8\nU.S. Veterans\u00a0Community\nNovember (Veterans\u2019 Day)\n$3,000\n$2400\n9\nU.S. Generations\nDecember (Or April or August)\n$3,000\n$2400\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\nTOTAL\n$30K\n$24K\n\u00a0\nAdditional Workshops & Learning Opportunities:\nManeshi asked about the \u201cBuilding Executive Presence for a Diverse Group of Leaders\u201d workshop.

Please let us know if there\u2019s anything else you need from us in the interim. \n\u00a0\nFrom our perspective, next steps would be:\nLCW with Unilever to finalize the scope of the work, including Spotlights, tailoring to ensure inclusion of Canadian perspective, post-Spotlight conversation facilitator guide, and rough schedule. \nLCW to draw up a Statement of Work, which would be sent to you for signature\nBeginning of work!\n\u00a0\nWe very much look forward to our partnership in 2024.\n\u00a0\nBest, \nRebecca and the LCW Team\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\nRebecca M.

We do have a library of miniworkshops, which includes topics beyond the Spotlights (please see attached). Finally, we offer a variety of workshops on other DEI topics, we can talk about those when we meet. \n\u00a0\nAnd yes, for many of our sessions we incorporate Canadian perspectives, and for those that we haven\u2019t yet, we\u00a0 most certainly can.\n\u00a0\nLooking forward to our discussion as well. \n\u00a0\nRebecca\n\u00a0\nRebecca M.

Reaching our decision has been a long process, and we respectfully ask for a few more days. In the journey of interviewing and deliberating over various companies, we have concluded that we need to work with two Diversity, Equity, Inclusion, and Belonging (DEIB) providers. This represents a shift from our original belief that one company could provide all we needed. Having decided that we need two providers, we will now hire for two positions:\n1)\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\nA\u00a0\nDEIB Leadership Team Provider\u00a0\nwill provide the guidance and mentorship required by our organization\u2019s leadership team, and a\n2)\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\nDEIB Training and Facilitation Provider\n\u00a0will provide training to SDSN\u2019s staff members .\nWe have tentatively selected the\n\u00a0DEIB Leadership Team Provider\n. We believe that\u00a0LCW\u00a0is a strong candidate for the\u00a0\nDEIB Training and Facilitation Provider.\u00a0\n If you remain interested, please\u00a0translate the preliminary proposal you submitted to SDSN some weeks ago into a detailed work plan by weeks and by the topics that will be covered in your DEIB training and facilitation sessions for SDSN. Be aware that many on the SDSN DEIB Committee found it difficult to envision the flow of the training and its general content.\n\u00a0\n\u00a0For the proposed proposal, please bear in mind the following points:\n1)\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\nThe audience for the\u00a0\nDEIB Training Facilitation Provider\n\u00a0training will comprise about 60\u201380 SDSN personnel, including both SDSN leadership and staff members. Most participants will be from the USA and France with some from Malaysia.\n2)\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\nThe assumed total price point is $25,000 for several weeks of online training, with at least one facilitated training and follow-up provided over the complete duration of the training.\n3)\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\nOur training needs remain the same, that is, online training(s) for up to 60\u201380 staff members that addresses the unconscious biases that stand in the way of our ability to foster an inclusive work culture and community; lead to discrimination against anyone who is different, including anyone under the\u00a0\ntransgender umbrella (encompassing binary and nonbinary trans people); increases the feeling of psychological peril, or limit the access of people with disabilities to our workspaces and resources\n.\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\nPlease free to contact us with any questions you may have.\n\u00a0\nSincerely,\n\u00a0\nLucia.\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n-- \nDr. Lucia Rodriguez\nDirector, Master's in Development Practice (MDP) Program Secretariat\nSustainable Development Goals (SDG)-Academy Division\n\u00a0\nSustainable Development Solutions Network (SDSN)\n475 Riverside Drive\nSuite 530\nNew York, New York 10115\n\u00a0\nlucia.rodriguez@unsdsn.org\n\u00a0\nLearn more about the MDP here,\nwww.mdpglobal.org\n\u00a0\nLearn more about SDSN here,\nwww.unsdsn.org\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n-- \nDr. Lucia Rodriguez\nDirector, Master's in Development Practice (MDP) Program Secretariat\nSustainable Development Goals (SDG)-Academy Division\n\u00a0\nSustainable Development Solutions Network (SDSN)\n475 Riverside Drive\nSuite 530\nNew York, New York 10115\n\u00a0\nlucia.rodriguez@unsdsn.org\n\u00a0\nLearn more about the MDP here,\nwww.mdpglobal.org\n\u00a0\nLearn more about SDSN here,\nwww.unsdsn.org\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n-- \nDr. Lucia Rodriguez\nDirector, Master's in Development Practice (MDP) Program Secretariat\nSustainable Development Goals (SDG)-Academy Division\n\u00a0\nSustainable Development Solutions Network (SDSN)\n475 Riverside Drive\nSuite 530\nNew York, New York 10115\n\u00a0\nlucia.rodriguez@unsdsn.org\n\u00a0\nLearn more about the MDP here,\nwww.mdpglobal.org\n\u00a0\nLearn more about SDSN here,\nwww.unsdsn.org\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n-- \nDr. Lucia Rodriguez\nDirector, Master's in Development Practice (MDP) Program Secretariat\nSustainable Development Goals (SDG)-Academy Division\n\u00a0\nSustainable Development Solutions Network (SDSN)\n475 Riverside Drive\nSuite 530\nNew York, New York 10115\n\u00a0\nlucia.rodriguez@unsdsn.org\n\u00a0\nLearn more about the MDP here,\nwww.mdpglobal.org\n\u00a0\nLearn more about SDSN here,\nwww.unsdsn.org\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n-- \nStacey Clark\nVice President of Operations\nSustainable Development Solutions Network\nPronouns: she/her\nM:\u00a0\n+1-917-592-4546\nstacey.clark@unsdsn.org\nwww.unsdsn.org\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\u00a0\n\u00a0\n-- \nDr. Lucia Rodriguez\nDirector, Master's in Development Practice (MDP) Program Secretariat\nSustainable Development Goals (SDG)-Academy Division\n\u00a0\nSustainable Development Solutions Network (SDSN)\n475 Riverside Drive\nSuite 530\nNew York, New York 10115\n\u00a0\nlucia.rodriguez@unsdsn.org\n\u00a0\nLearn more about the MDP here,\nwww.mdpglobal.org\n\u00a0\nLearn more about SDSN here,\nwww.unsdsn.org\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n-- \nDr. Lucia Rodriguez\nDirector, Master's in Development Practice (MDP) Program Secretariat\nSustainable Development Goals (SDG)-Academy Division\n\u00a0\nSustainable Development Solutions Network (SDSN)\n475 Riverside Drive\nSuite 530\nNew York, New York 10115\n\u00a0\nlucia.rodriguez@unsdsn.org\n\u00a0\nLearn more about the MDP here,\nwww.mdpglobal.org\n\u00a0\nLearn more about SDSN here,\nwww.unsdsn.org",

Reaching our decision has been a long process, and we respectfully ask for a few more days. In the journey of interviewing and deliberating over various companies, we have concluded that we need to work with two Diversity, Equity, Inclusion, and Belonging (DEIB) providers. This represents a shift from our original belief that one company could provide all we needed. Having decided that we need two providers, we will now hire for two positions:\n1)\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\nA\u00a0\nDEIB Leadership Team Provider\u00a0\nwill provide the guidance and mentorship required by our organization\u2019s leadership team, and a\n2)\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\nDEIB Training and Facilitation Provider\n\u00a0will provide training to SDSN\u2019s staff members .\nWe have tentatively selected the\n\u00a0DEIB Leadership Team Provider\n. We believe that\u00a0LCW\u00a0is a strong candidate for the\u00a0\nDEIB Training and Facilitation Provider.\u00a0\n If you remain interested, please\u00a0translate the preliminary proposal you submitted to SDSN some weeks ago into a detailed work plan by weeks and by the topics that will be covered in your DEIB training and facilitation sessions for SDSN. Be aware that many on the SDSN DEIB Committee found it difficult to envision the flow of the training and its general content.\n\u00a0\n\u00a0For the proposed proposal, please bear in mind the following points:\n1)\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\nThe audience for the\u00a0\nDEIB Training Facilitation Provider\n\u00a0training will comprise about 60\u201380 SDSN personnel, including both SDSN leadership and staff members. Most participants will be from the USA and France with some from Malaysia.\n2)\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\nThe assumed total price point is $25,000 for several weeks of online training, with at least one facilitated training and follow-up provided over the complete duration of the training.\n3)\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\nOur training needs remain the same, that is, online training(s) for up to 60\u201380 staff members that addresses the unconscious biases that stand in the way of our ability to foster an inclusive work culture and community; lead to discrimination against anyone who is different, including anyone under the\u00a0\ntransgender umbrella (encompassing binary and nonbinary trans people); increases the feeling of psychological peril, or limit the access of people with disabilities to our workspaces and resources\n.\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\nPlease free to contact us with any questions you may have.\n\u00a0\nSincerely,\n\u00a0\nLucia.\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n-- \nDr. Lucia Rodriguez\nDirector, Master's in Development Practice (MDP) Program Secretariat\nSustainable Development Goals (SDG)-Academy Division\n\u00a0\nSustainable Development Solutions Network (SDSN)\n475 Riverside Drive\nSuite 530\nNew York, New York 10115\n\u00a0\nlucia.rodriguez@unsdsn.org\n\u00a0\nLearn more about the MDP here,\nwww.mdpglobal.org\n\u00a0\nLearn more about SDSN here,\nwww.unsdsn.org\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n-- \nDr. Lucia Rodriguez\nDirector, Master's in Development Practice (MDP) Program Secretariat\nSustainable Development Goals (SDG)-Academy Division\n\u00a0\nSustainable Development Solutions Network (SDSN)\n475 Riverside Drive\nSuite 530\nNew York, New York 10115\n\u00a0\nlucia.rodriguez@unsdsn.org\n\u00a0\nLearn more about the MDP here,\nwww.mdpglobal.org\n\u00a0\nLearn more about SDSN here,\nwww.unsdsn.org\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n-- \nDr. Lucia Rodriguez\nDirector, Master's in Development Practice (MDP) Program Secretariat\nSustainable Development Goals (SDG)-Academy Division\n\u00a0\nSustainable Development Solutions Network (SDSN)\n475 Riverside Drive\nSuite 530\nNew York, New York 10115\n\u00a0\nlucia.rodriguez@unsdsn.org\n\u00a0\nLearn more about the MDP here,\nwww.mdpglobal.org\n\u00a0\nLearn more about SDSN here,\nwww.unsdsn.org\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n-- \nDr. Lucia Rodriguez\nDirector, Master's in Development Practice (MDP) Program Secretariat\nSustainable Development Goals (SDG)-Academy Division\n\u00a0\nSustainable Development Solutions Network (SDSN)\n475 Riverside Drive\nSuite 530\nNew York, New York 10115\n\u00a0\nlucia.rodriguez@unsdsn.org\n\u00a0\nLearn more about the MDP here,\nwww.mdpglobal.org\n\u00a0\nLearn more about SDSN here,\nwww.unsdsn.org\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n-- \nStacey Clark\nVice President of Operations\nSustainable Development Solutions Network\nPronouns: she/her\nM:\u00a0\n+1-917-592-4546\nstacey.clark@unsdsn.org\nwww.unsdsn.org\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\u00a0\n\u00a0\n-- \nDr. Lucia Rodriguez\nDirector, Master's in Development Practice (MDP) Program Secretariat\nSustainable Development Goals (SDG)-Academy Division\n\u00a0\nSustainable Development Solutions Network (SDSN)\n475 Riverside Drive\nSuite 530\nNew York, New York 10115\n\u00a0\nlucia.rodriguez@unsdsn.org\n\u00a0\nLearn more about the MDP here,\nwww.mdpglobal.org\n\u00a0\nLearn more about SDSN here,\nwww.unsdsn.org\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n-- \nDr. Lucia Rodriguez\nDirector, Master's in Development Practice (MDP) Program Secretariat\nSustainable Development Goals (SDG)-Academy Division\n\u00a0\nSustainable Development Solutions Network (SDSN)\n475 Riverside Drive\nSuite 530\nNew York, New York 10115\n\u00a0\nlucia.rodriguez@unsdsn.org\n\u00a0\nLearn more about the MDP here,\nwww.mdpglobal.org\n\u00a0\nLearn more about SDSN here,\nwww.unsdsn.org",
