Today, following many months of hard work and commitment from our team, coupled with incredible loyalty and support from all of you, \nI'm proud and delighted to share that we have now completed this global restructuring.\nWe've successfully strengthened our real estate portfolio around the world, and have received Court approval to emerge from the Chapter 11 process in the U.S. and Canada. We expect to emerge following the completion of routine administrative matters mid-June, which you can read more about \nhere\n and find additional information about \nhere\n.\nWe're grateful that you continue to choose us as your trusted workspace provider. While we've had to make some very difficult decisions throughout this process, I am confident that we have firmly established a strong foundation for a sustainable and exciting future at WeWork. A future that empowers us to invest in our products and services and provide innovative workplace solutions - all while growing responsibly far into the future.\nWhen asked to take on the role of CEO one year ago, I accepted without hesitation because I knew that WeWork offered a unique experience well beyond our physical workspaces. Spending just one day in a WeWork, no matter where you are in the world, one immediately understands what makes our company special: our community.\nIt is not an understatement to say that we have never been more confident in our ability to deliver best-in-class services and products so that you can do your best work. To our entire community, on behalf of the WeWork team, thank you, sincerely, for your patience and support as we have navigated a uniquely challenging year. With this work now behind us, we look forward to delivering for you in the months and years ahead.\nWith gratitude,\nDavid Tolley\nChief Executive Officer\nWeWork\n\u00a0\n \n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\nRefer friends\n | \nDownload the WeWork App\n \nUnsubscribe\n | \nTerms\n | \nPrivacy \n| \nView in a browser\nThis email was sent from \nWeWork\n12 East 49th Street, Floor 3 New York, NY, 10017 US",

As part of this effort, we worked to renegotiate nearly all of our real estate leases globally, to reach sustainable economic terms and enable our business to best serve you and our other members far into the future.\nI am excited to share that we have officially completed our lease portfolio review in Chicago.\nWith the support of our landlord partners and a continuing portfolio of our strongest locations, WeWork is now better positioned to operate in Chicago for the long term and is one step closer to emerging from Chapter 11 by the end of May. \nOn behalf of the entire WeWork team, we are truly grateful for your patience as we have navigated this process, and that you continue to choose to be part of our community. As we move forward, our team\u2019s undivided attention is on ensuring we continue to deliver best-in-class member experiences to you. \nFor more information on this announcement, please \nvisit our newsroom post. \nWe look forward to being your trusted workplace provider in Chicago for many years to come. \nWith gratitude,\nDavid Tolley\nChief Executive Officer\n\u00a0\n \n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\nRefer friends\n | \nDownload the WeWork App\n \n\u00a0\nTerms\n | \nPrivacy \n| \nView in a browser\nThis email was sent from \nWeWork\n12 East 49th Street, Floor 3 New York, NY, 10017 US",

    "body": "You don't often get email from marketing@charcap.com. \nLearn why this is important\n\u00a0\n \nAmerica's Leading Invoice Factoring Company for More Than 20 Years\n \n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \n6 Success-Amplifying Small Business Skills Anyone Can Master\nInvesting in developing your small business skills is one of the best ways to support your company. Below, we\u2019ll walk you through some of the most critical areas to focus on.\n\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \n1. Financial Management Skills\nAn estimated 82 percent of business failures can be traced back to poor cash flow management, according to the National Federation of Independent Business (NFIB). Business owners must know how to predict cash flow accurately, budget accordingly, and identify working capital options before cash is needed.\n2. Customer Service, Marketing, and Sales Skills\nMany people view customer service, marketing, and sales as wholly different things. While they are typically managed independently, no area can perform at its peak unless the other areas are strong.\u00a0 \n3. Communication Skills\nBusiness communication skills come into play whether you\u2019re asking a customer to place their next order or smoothing out employee concerns. Spend time chatting with employees and study negotiation techniques to level up.\n4. Management and Leadership Skills\nAlthough management and leadership skills are often thought of as interchangeable, they\u2019re quite different in practice. \u201cManagement is doing things right; leadership is doing the right things,\u201d as Peter Drucker said. One is process-oriented, and the other is inspiration-oriented. \n5. Planning and Problem-Solving Skills\nYou constantly use problem-solving skills throughout the day. Use puzzles to boost your abilities and bring your staff together around activities like escape rooms for the extra team-building benefit. \n6. Networking Skills\nDeveloping networking skills will expose you to new opportunities and help you build connections that can help your business grow. Plus, it can help eliminate the sense of isolation business owners often feel.\nBuild Your Small Business Skills with Help from Charter Capital\nBuilding your business acumen skills can be fun, and you can do it over time. If a lack of working capital prevents you from seizing an opportunity to learn, invoice factoring can provide you with the cash you need to upskill and strengthen your business. To learn more or get started, \nrequest a free rate quote from Charter Capital\n.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \nREQUEST A QUOTE \n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \nExpand Your Business with Help from Charter Capital\nCharter Capital makes it easy to secure capital when you need it most. Use your factoring cash to fund growth initiatives right away, or simply be prepared in case your business needs a quick cash injection later.\u00a0\nTo learn more or get started, request a complimentary factoring quote from Charter Capital.\u00a0\nFollow Us On\n \n \n \n \n \n\u00a0\u00a0\nCopyright \u00a9 2024 Charter Capital\u00a0\nHoldings LP, All rights reserved\u00a0\n6750 West Loop South, Suite 1010 Bellaire, TX 77401 | +1-855-645-1639\nIf you'd like to stop receiving these messages, \nunsubscribe",
