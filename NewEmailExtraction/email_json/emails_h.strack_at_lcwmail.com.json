Presented in partnership by The Better Man Movement and Jennifer Brown Consulting, our goal is help activate everyone, no matter where they are on their learning journey, to be a part of the conversation.\n\u00a0\nMany are striving to build competence, and confidence, to step up, and speak up, but are afraid to say the wrong thing, feeling guilty or even targeted and blamed as the problem. It has become more difficult than ever to practice the imperfect art of allyship - however we identify, because there are few spaces where we can return to the building blocks of inclusion - places where we can deepen our self-awareness, analyze how trust is built, unearth our story, and practice both sharing and listening.\n\u00a0\nThis conference is a series of conversations and workshops aimed to foster learning, connection, trust, and empathy, with the intent of articulating a vision for true partnership that includes and enlists\u00a0\nall of us\n.\n\u00a0\nEarly bird ends \nTOMOROROW August 15th at\n 11:59 pm\u00a0- secure your tickets while this special lasts.\nSecure Your Seat\n \nWarmest Regards,\n\u00a0\nJennifer Brown\nCEO & Founder,\u00a0\nJennifer Brown Consulting\nAuthor,\u00a0\nInclusion\n,\u00a0\nHow to Be an Inclusive Leader\n, and\u00a0\nBeyond Diversity\nHost,\u00a0\nThe Will To Change\n\u00a0Podcast\n\u00a0\nFollow me on \nLinkedIn\n,\u00a0\nTwitter\n,\u00a0\nInstagram\n, and\u00a0\nFacebook\nConnect with Us\n \n \n \n \nJennifer Brown Consulting, 20 E 9th Street, Suite 4U, New York, NY 10003 \nUnsubscribe\n \nManage preferences",

This educational event is only one month from TODAY!\nDon't miss this Saturday Seminar!\u00a0\u00a0\nJay\u00a0Cafferata\n\u00a0will focus on how we unknowingly and unfortunately perpetuate racist ideology, colonialism, oppression, and discrimination in the words we use.\u00a0 We'll be discussing the breakdown in communication between intercultural and inclusion dialogues. When we think about intercultural, we think international, global or worldwide \u2013 but when we think about inclusion, we think local, internal and the workplace.

    "body": "Happy International Allyship Day! This holiday is dedicated to celebrating and promoting the power of allyship across the globe.\n \nHi Hannah,\n\u00a0\nHappy International Allyship Day - a day dedicated to celebrating and promoting the power of allyship across the globe. Today, we come together to recognize the importance of, and our role in, standing up for one another, fostering inclusivity, and building bridges of support and understanding.\n\u00a0\nBeing an effective ally means standing up for equity and inclusion and speaking out against discrimination and exclusion. But practicing sustained allyship is harder than it looks. It requires examining how we may be complicit in perpetuating stereotypes, biases, and discrimination, just by participating in our day-to-day role in the workplace. It means getting comfortable with the uncomfortable and persevering when we make mistakes and get it wrong. These challenges are really all about introspection - reflecting on our own role and identity, learning more about the lived experiences of other identity groups, and translating our learning into action.\n\u00a0\nI often say allyship is not a destination, it is a journey. Allyship does not happen on its own, it is a conscious action that one continuously strives for on a daily basis.\u00a0\n\u00a0\nToday, my ask of you is to recommit to your allyship and take action to make the world a more equitable and inclusive place, so everyone can thrive.\nBuild Your Allyship Toolkit at \nthe Virtual Better Together Conference this Oct 18-19\n\u00a0\nJoin us for the\n \nBetter Together Conference\n,\n an event for leaders who are eager to\n \nstep into their allyship to create inclusive workplaces and for those who may be uncertain of where they fit into the inclusion equation.\n\u00a0\nMany are striving to build competence, and confidence, to step up, and speak up, but are afraid to say the wrong thing, feeling guilty or even targeted and blamed as the problem. It has become more difficult than ever to practice the imperfect art of allyship - however we identify, because there are few spaces where we can return to the building blocks of inclusion - places where we can deepen our self-awareness, analyze how trust is built, unearth our story, and practice both sharing and listening.\u00a0\n\u00a0\nThe Better Together Conference\n is a series of conversations and workshops aimed to foster learning, connection, trust, and empathy, with the intent of articulating a vision for true partnership that includes and enlists \nall of us\n.\u00a0\n\u00a0\nTicket prices increase \nAugust 15th\n - secure your tickets while early bird rates last.\u00a0\nSecure my Ticket\n \nGroup Ticket Packages & Sponsorships\n\u00a0\nThere are currently limited group ticket packages and sponsorships available for organizations who want to be more involved in this transformational event.

It's time we own our space with fortitude.\nLet's talk about it.

When we think about intercultural, we think international, global or worldwide \u2013 but when we think about inclusion, we think local, internal and the workplace. Why are we having these different conversations to the same discourse? What is the breakdown between these two seemingly different sets of vocabulary?\nThis interactive 4-hour session will include videos, polling, and breakout sessions. Participants are encouraged to join using a device that has a camera and a microphone as well as a secondary device like a phone or computer that allows for multiple windows to be open at the same time for the polling.\nParticipants will discuss and reflect on:\nThe words we use to describe others\nHistorical perspectives on these two lexicons\nGlobal vs Local\nThe direction of impact: who is studying who?\nAt the conclusion of the presentation, participants will have:\nA greater recognition of how inclusion and intercultural fit together.\nThe basic awareness of how we present ourselves in an environment or culture that is not necessarily our own.\nStrategies to be more aware of where we are as professionals.\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nRegistration Fees\n$20 for Students\n$45 for current SIETAR USA members in good standing\n$65 for non-members\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nStudent-Register \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nMember-Register \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nNon-Member-Register \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nYour Seminar Leader\nJay Cafferata, MS, CDE\nMr. Cafferata is a well-known speaker and advocate for issues involving Diversity, Equity, Inclusion, and Belonging.

    "body": "Tried and tested tips for cultivating extra-role performance.\n \n \n\u00a0\nHi Hannah,\n\u00a0\nWhen it comes to analyzing how people perform at work, most organizations focus on in-role performance, i.e. whether employees are meeting or exceeding specific KPIs that are tied directly to their job.\n\u00a0 \nBut there\u2019s another indicator that may be just as impactful: extra-role performance.\n\u00a0 \nThis means self-motivated behavior that benefits the organization but is not directly tied to an employee\u2019s role. This could be anything from assisting colleagues when they're overloaded or helping new team members adapt to the company culture, to making suggestions for improvement or conserving company resources during tough times.\n\u00a0 \nIn this week\u2019s blog post, we look at why extra-role performance can be such a powerful X-factor for businesses, and outline some simple steps companies can take to cultivate it.\n\u00a0 \nFind out more here.\n\u00a0 \nFree Webinar TODAY!\nFrom Day One\u2019s virtual conference \u2018\nKeys to Employee Satisfaction, Recognition, and Retention\n\u2019 takes place TODAY (July 26) from noon to 4.30pm Eastern Time, and I\u2019m thrilled to be on the panel for the \u2018Bridging the Distance: How Tech Can Boost Engagement and Recognition\u2019 webinar from 1.20pm-2pm ET.\n\u00a0 \nTickets are usually priced $149, but Attuned newsletter subscribers can \nsign up for a free VIP Ticket here\n.\n\u00a0\nI hope to see you there!\n\u00a0\nCasey\nCasey Wahl\nFounder & CEO\nP.S.
