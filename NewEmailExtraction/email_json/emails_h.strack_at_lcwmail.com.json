Presented in partnership by The Better Man Movement and Jennifer Brown Consulting, our goal is help activate everyone, no matter where they are on their learning journey, to be a part of the conversation.\n\u00a0\nMany are striving to build competence, and confidence, to step up, and speak up, but are afraid to say the wrong thing, feeling guilty or even targeted and blamed as the problem. It has become more difficult than ever to practice the imperfect art of allyship - however we identify, because there are few spaces where we can return to the building blocks of inclusion - places where we can deepen our self-awareness, analyze how trust is built, unearth our story, and practice both sharing and listening.\n\u00a0\nThis conference is a series of conversations and workshops aimed to foster learning, connection, trust, and empathy, with the intent of articulating a vision for true partnership that includes and enlists\u00a0\nall of us\n.\n\u00a0\nEarly bird ends \nTOMOROROW August 15th at\n 11:59 pm\u00a0- secure your tickets while this special lasts.\nSecure Your Seat\n \nWarmest Regards,\n\u00a0\nJennifer Brown\nCEO & Founder,\u00a0\nJennifer Brown Consulting\nAuthor,\u00a0\nInclusion\n,\u00a0\nHow to Be an Inclusive Leader\n, and\u00a0\nBeyond Diversity\nHost,\u00a0\nThe Will To Change\n\u00a0Podcast\n\u00a0\nFollow me on \nLinkedIn\n,\u00a0\nTwitter\n,\u00a0\nInstagram\n, and\u00a0\nFacebook\nConnect with Us\n \n \n \n \nJennifer Brown Consulting, 20 E 9th Street, Suite 4U, New York, NY 10003 \nUnsubscribe\n \nManage preferences",

This educational event is only one month from TODAY!\nDon't miss this Saturday Seminar!\u00a0\u00a0\nJay\u00a0Cafferata\n\u00a0will focus on how we unknowingly and unfortunately perpetuate racist ideology, colonialism, oppression, and discrimination in the words we use.\u00a0 We'll be discussing the breakdown in communication between intercultural and inclusion dialogues. When we think about intercultural, we think international, global or worldwide \u2013 but when we think about inclusion, we think local, internal and the workplace.

    "body": "Happy International Allyship Day! This holiday is dedicated to celebrating and promoting the power of allyship across the globe.\n \nHi Hannah,\n\u00a0\nHappy International Allyship Day - a day dedicated to celebrating and promoting the power of allyship across the globe. Today, we come together to recognize the importance of, and our role in, standing up for one another, fostering inclusivity, and building bridges of support and understanding.\n\u00a0\nBeing an effective ally means standing up for equity and inclusion and speaking out against discrimination and exclusion. But practicing sustained allyship is harder than it looks. It requires examining how we may be complicit in perpetuating stereotypes, biases, and discrimination, just by participating in our day-to-day role in the workplace. It means getting comfortable with the uncomfortable and persevering when we make mistakes and get it wrong. These challenges are really all about introspection - reflecting on our own role and identity, learning more about the lived experiences of other identity groups, and translating our learning into action.\n\u00a0\nI often say allyship is not a destination, it is a journey. Allyship does not happen on its own, it is a conscious action that one continuously strives for on a daily basis.\u00a0\n\u00a0\nToday, my ask of you is to recommit to your allyship and take action to make the world a more equitable and inclusive place, so everyone can thrive.\nBuild Your Allyship Toolkit at \nthe Virtual Better Together Conference this Oct 18-19\n\u00a0\nJoin us for the\n \nBetter Together Conference\n,\n an event for leaders who are eager to\n \nstep into their allyship to create inclusive workplaces and for those who may be uncertain of where they fit into the inclusion equation.\n\u00a0\nMany are striving to build competence, and confidence, to step up, and speak up, but are afraid to say the wrong thing, feeling guilty or even targeted and blamed as the problem. It has become more difficult than ever to practice the imperfect art of allyship - however we identify, because there are few spaces where we can return to the building blocks of inclusion - places where we can deepen our self-awareness, analyze how trust is built, unearth our story, and practice both sharing and listening.\u00a0\n\u00a0\nThe Better Together Conference\n is a series of conversations and workshops aimed to foster learning, connection, trust, and empathy, with the intent of articulating a vision for true partnership that includes and enlists \nall of us\n.\u00a0\n\u00a0\nTicket prices increase \nAugust 15th\n - secure your tickets while early bird rates last.\u00a0\nSecure my Ticket\n \nGroup Ticket Packages & Sponsorships\n\u00a0\nThere are currently limited group ticket packages and sponsorships available for organizations who want to be more involved in this transformational event.

It's time we own our space with fortitude.\nLet's talk about it.

When we think about intercultural, we think international, global or worldwide \u2013 but when we think about inclusion, we think local, internal and the workplace. Why are we having these different conversations to the same discourse? What is the breakdown between these two seemingly different sets of vocabulary?\nThis interactive 4-hour session will include videos, polling, and breakout sessions. Participants are encouraged to join using a device that has a camera and a microphone as well as a secondary device like a phone or computer that allows for multiple windows to be open at the same time for the polling.\nParticipants will discuss and reflect on:\nThe words we use to describe others\nHistorical perspectives on these two lexicons\nGlobal vs Local\nThe direction of impact: who is studying who?\nAt the conclusion of the presentation, participants will have:\nA greater recognition of how inclusion and intercultural fit together.\nThe basic awareness of how we present ourselves in an environment or culture that is not necessarily our own.\nStrategies to be more aware of where we are as professionals.\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nRegistration Fees\n$20 for Students\n$45 for current SIETAR USA members in good standing\n$65 for non-members\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nStudent-Register \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nMember-Register \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nNon-Member-Register \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nYour Seminar Leader\nJay Cafferata, MS, CDE\nMr. Cafferata is a well-known speaker and advocate for issues involving Diversity, Equity, Inclusion, and Belonging.

    "body": "Tried and tested tips for cultivating extra-role performance.\n \n \n\u00a0\nHi Hannah,\n\u00a0\nWhen it comes to analyzing how people perform at work, most organizations focus on in-role performance, i.e. whether employees are meeting or exceeding specific KPIs that are tied directly to their job.\n\u00a0 \nBut there\u2019s another indicator that may be just as impactful: extra-role performance.\n\u00a0 \nThis means self-motivated behavior that benefits the organization but is not directly tied to an employee\u2019s role. This could be anything from assisting colleagues when they're overloaded or helping new team members adapt to the company culture, to making suggestions for improvement or conserving company resources during tough times.\n\u00a0 \nIn this week\u2019s blog post, we look at why extra-role performance can be such a powerful X-factor for businesses, and outline some simple steps companies can take to cultivate it.\n\u00a0 \nFind out more here.\n\u00a0 \nFree Webinar TODAY!\nFrom Day One\u2019s virtual conference \u2018\nKeys to Employee Satisfaction, Recognition, and Retention\n\u2019 takes place TODAY (July 26) from noon to 4.30pm Eastern Time, and I\u2019m thrilled to be on the panel for the \u2018Bridging the Distance: How Tech Can Boost Engagement and Recognition\u2019 webinar from 1.20pm-2pm ET.\n\u00a0 \nTickets are usually priced $149, but Attuned newsletter subscribers can \nsign up for a free VIP Ticket here\n.\n\u00a0\nI hope to see you there!\n\u00a0\nCasey\nCasey Wahl\nFounder & CEO\nP.S.

    "body": "View this email in your browser\n\u00a0\nDear \nHannah,\nMy latest blog post is up:\nI Ran 100 Miles. Here\u2019s What I Learned About Mindset, Community, and Persistence. \nPhoto credit: Eddy Mo\nThe Western States Event\nThat\u2019s me, on June 24, 2023, 55.7 miles into a 100-mile endurance run.\nIt wasn\u2019t my first race at the 100-mile distance, but it was my first (and maybe only) shot at the \nWestern States Endurance Run\n, the oldest 100-mile foot race in North America, and possibly the world (having started in 1974).\nIts epic sweep takes runners from Olympic Valley, California (near Lake Tahoe), up and over high mountain passes and ridges, down through dizzyingly steep canyons, like a descending roller coaster, to the Middle Fork of the American River and, ultimately, the Sierra foothills town of Auburn, California, where runners finish on the track at Placer High School. By the finish, runners have climbed about 18,000 feet and descended about 23,000. \nYou\u2019re catching me at rock bottom. After a day with stretches of gratitude, wonder, and practiced focus, at some point something changed, and I\u2019ve just spent 17-plus steep, dusty miles, and about 5 \u00bd hours, saying mean things to myself about how slowly I\u2019m moving, how bad I am at executing race plans at this distance, how much faster I should be moving with the cool conditions\u2026you name it.\nBut I\u2019m getting ahead of myself.\nSince 2017 I\u2019d been training hard to finish long \u201cqualifier\u201d trail races and earn a spot in the (in)famous annual lottery for a coveted spot in \u201cStates,\u201d as the race is affectionately known in the ultramarathon-running (or, \u201cultrarunning\u201d) community. Lottery day \u2014 the first Saturday each December \u2014 yielded disappointment after disappointment, even as my ticket count doubled each year.\nFinally, last December 3, I awoke to a text message from a former coach, telling me my name had been drawn. Colette \u2014 my spouse, life partner, and fellow ultrarunner \u2014 and I were giddy, and immediately kicked into planning mode: Who should be my crew, taking care of me at various points along the route? Who should be my pacers, accompanying me over the final 40ish miles? Was there somewhere we could stay the week before the race, to help acclimatize to the 6,200-foot elevation of the start line at Olympic Valley? And many, many more questions.\nFast-forward to 5:00 a.m. on June 24, when the race officially began. Everything from training to logistics to the cooler-than-expected weather forecast had gone as well as I\u2019d hoped for, or better. A head cold two days before the race was an unhappy surprise, but I wasn\u2019t about to withdraw and send myself back to the lottery. I knew this was probably my only shot at finishing States: it could take years to get back into the race, and at 55, I\u2019ve begun feeling the steepening downhill trend that inevitably comes with age.\nHead cold be damned: this was it.\nEven for the fastest runners, the tale of a 100-mile race is long: full of literal and figurative ups and downs, moments of despair and exhilaration, and chance after chance for epiphanies great and small. For folks who run at a pace like I ran States in 2023, the tale is longer still. So, you may be relieved to know that I\u2019m not here to tell you the story of my whole race. I may tell that story one day, but not here, not now. Today, I\u2019ll simply share a bit about the moment in the photo, how it fed into the rest of my race, and how it\u2019s helped me learn and relearn some key life lessons that anyone can apply.\nBeware the Chair\nIt\u2019s bedrock wisdom in the ultrarunning community: unless you need to change your shoes, tend to an injury, or do something else that really, truly \nrequires\n you to sit down, you should avoid sitting at all costs.\nI arrive at Michigan Bluff aid station, Mile 55.7, greeted by an arch of brightly colored balloons, music pumping, and \u2014 the ultimate show of support in the trail-running community \u2014 cowbells ringing. I\u2019m an hour ahead of the race cutoff (the absolute deadline for leaving the aid station) and desperately needing a \u201creset.\u201d\nOr, that\u2019s what I\u2019ve been telling myself. If you ask me what I mean by \u201creset,\u201d I won\u2019t be able to tell you anything coherent. I probably mean something like, \u201cI want to feel like I felt at the start line.\u201d Yeah, right.\nI\u2019ve been physically worn down by the relentless course, but even more, I\u2019ve been battering myself with negative self-talk, mile after mile, hour after hour.\nMy stomach has also gone sideways. This is nothing new: it\u2019s normal for me, and for most ultrarunners, to have a hard time getting calories in, and keeping them down, the deeper we get into an ultra. Even so, I\u2019ve been beating myself up for not eating more.\nMy crew consists of Colette, my older daughter Mariette, and her fianc\u00e9, Eddy. Also at Michigan Bluff is Chuck, who will be pacing me \u2014 accompanying me on the trail \u2014 for the next 24 miles.\nAs I enter the aid station, ducking through the buoyant-but-low-hung balloon arch, Colette says, \u201cWelcome to the party! It\u2019s going to be a short party.\u201d\nMy terse reply: \u201cNo it\u2019s not!\u201d\nEven though I\u2019ve given myself a decent cushion against the cutoff, Colette is eager to get me in and out of the aid station as quickly as possible. Foolishly, I ignore her and make a beeline for the chair.\nI lament out loud: \u201cI have not been able to get any calories. I want some broth. And if they have noodles, that\u2019d be amazing.\u201d\nI\u2019ve never run an ultra where I\u2019m consistently able to take in \nanything\n sweet this far in. Back in November 2022, the last time Chuck paced me at a 100-miler, he offered me a taste of an energy gel at about Mile 76. I ate literally one drop and promptly dry-heaved.\nThis time I know better: I feel like I can actually take in savory calories through the broth, preferably supplemented with noodles.\nAs it turns out, they have rice with the broth, which works just as well. I begin sipping as quickly as I can, and shaking the bottle (which you can see in the picture) to try to get the rice out.\nThis is all good.\nLess good? What the chair is starting to do to my psyche.\nUltrarunners know that the \u201cpity party\u201d is always beckoning. The many forms of discomfort we experience \u2014 physical and mental fatigue, sleep deprivation, muscle aches, blisters, and sundry other maladies \u2014 along with the knowledge that we\u2019re nowhere near done, conspire to convince us that we\u2019re bound to fail. Along with that comes a generalized sense of \u201cwoe is me\u201d: the pity party.\nIn life outside of ultramarathons, I don\u2019t like the term. It\u2019s often used to dismiss the very real negative life outcomes faced by members of marginalized populations, brought about by unjust systems.\nWithin ultrarunning culture, though \u2014 in which each of us has not only chosen to race, but has spent countless hours training, and often non-trivial amounts of money, not to mention the sacrifices of our loved ones \u2014 \u201cpity party\u201d totally fits the bill.\nThere, in the chair, I sink more deeply into the pity party.\nWhile tending to my physical needs by trying to consume calories, I\u2019m neglecting the crucial mental side, on the verge of what could turn into a downward spiral, leading to a decision to drop from the race.\nAs I teeter on the edge, Chuck says to me, \u201cIf we get moving, you\u2019ll feel better.\u201d\nI know it\u2019s true. I\u2019m not ready to move just yet, but his words steady me.\nColette follows with: \u201cI\u2019m glad you\u2019re taking care of yourself. You\u2019ve been moving so great.\u201d\nI don\u2019t feel like I\u2019ve been moving great, but it\u2019s nice to hear this from Colette.\nI futz with my headlamp, which I\u2019ll be wearing for the next few hours as Chuck and I run together through the night. I manage to get it on, and it\u2019s working well.\nAll around me, everywhere I look, it\u2019s nothing but people who want me to succeed \u2014 like, really, really want me to succeed. Right now, it\u2019s feeling like they want me to succeed more than I want to myself.\nMariette (with great conviction): \u201cYou\u2019re gonna get through this.\u201d\nEddy: \u201cYou\u2019re doing great.\u201d\nSuddenly I\u2019m standing. I don\u2019t know how it\u2019s happened, but I\u2019ve left the gravitational pull of the chair.\nMike, a race official, says: \u201cGet on down the road. You\u2019re gonna do great. Keep it up.\u201d To my crew, he adds: \u201cYou guys can walk him out. Walk him out. You should get him outta here.\u201d To me, he adds: \u201cGo get \u2018em!\u201d\nChuck and I start walking, along with Colette, Mariette, and Eddy. Slowly at first, gradually picking up speed.\nColette again: \u201cI\u2019m really amazed at the way you\u2019re moving. Jaw-dropping, actually.\u201d\nI created a mantra around this a few ultras ago: \u201cI don\u2019t care how I\u2019m feeling. I care how I\u2019m moving.\u201d It\u2019s meant to remind me that I will always, always feel terrible after a certain number of miles, and so I shouldn\u2019t dwell on it, focusing instead on doing everything I can to keep moving forward as well as I can, for as long as I can. Colette\u2019s words call this mantra back to mind. I speed up a little.\nSoon it\u2019s time to part ways. Colette: \u201cWe love you and we\u2019re gonna see you at Foresthill!\u201d That\u2019s the next aid station, 6.3 up-and-down miles away, at Mile 62.0.\nThe Finish\nSpoiler alert: I eventually finished the race. (I promised you I wouldn\u2019t tell you the whole story!)\nMy finish happened during what\u2019s called the \u201cGolden Hour\u201d: the 30th and final hour of the race.\nGolden Hour is a time of fierce celebration. Hundreds upon hundreds of people \u2014 runners, coaches, officials, crews, pacers, friends, family, and even the townspeople of Auburn \u2014 turn up at 10:00 a.m. to cheer their hearts out for the runners who\u2019ve persevered the longest to reach the promised land of the Placer High track.\nThis year, 68 runners finished during Golden Hour: an average of over one per minute, making up over 20% of the 328 total finishers.\nThe race\u2019s official rules allow anyone and everyone to join runners for the final 1.3 miles from the last aid station, at Robie Point, to the finish. I was joined by Colette (who\u2019d been pacing me since Mile 94.3), Chuck (who\u2019d snuck in a little sleep in his car since leaving me with Clare at Mile 79.8), Clare (who paced me from Mile 78.0 to Mile 94.3), Drew (who\u2019d been coordinating crew from Foresthill and from his home in Auburn), Mariette, and Eddy. We ran together through the streets of Auburn, all smiles and whoops, cheered on by the locals, who mark this date in their calendars each June.\nThe finish was capped off by running together for 300 meters on the Placer High track.\nHere I am, right after crossing the finish line, in 29 hours, 29 minutes, and 33 seconds.\nColette, me, and Chuck (Photo credit: Facchino Photography)\nLesson #1: Listen to the voices that serve you.\nI\u2019ve never sought out people to run with, treasuring the hours of precious \u201cme time\u201d on the trails.\nOnce, years ago, as I passed a group of runners going the opposite direction on a fire road on a long run, I thought to myself, \u201cThere goes one version of hell.\u201d\nI still love my solo training runs, but never have I felt more deeply in my bones that I truly, undeniably \nneed\n others in order to succeed at ultrarunning. Western States has seen to that, and nowhere was it more apparent than at Michigan Bluff.\nEvery single word, every single movement of my crew was laser-focused on helping me succeed. To support me at aid stations along the way, they had braved a 3:00 a.m wakeup, narrow mountain roads, an hours-long line for a shuttle bus, and endless waiting for me to show up. Still to come after Michigan Bluff was more driving, along with a late bedtime, early wakeup, and, in Colette\u2019s case, six miles of pacing me on steep trails to the finish. Followed by more walking, lifting, waiting, care-giving. And the two-hour drive home.\nChuck paced me for 24 miles through the night and barely slept. Clare paced me for 16 miles through the wee hours of early morning and barely slept. Drew spent all morning, afternoon, evening, and night making sure everyone knew where I was, and where they needed to be when \u2014 and barely slept.\nThen, every one of them showed up at Robie Point to accompany me to the finish.\n1,500 volunteers at 20 aid stations made similar sacrifices, as did the crews and pacers of all 379 runners who started the race.\nFor hours on end, I\u2019d told myself I wasn\u2019t good enough, fast enough, or smart enough to reach the finish line and earn my coveted belt buckle. I\u2019d undermined myself by not eating well. I\u2019d even convinced myself there was beauty in failing, and that I might choose that beauty over continued suffering.\nMy crew and my pacers didn\u2019t know about any of that mental chatter, and if they had, they wouldn\u2019t have cared. They believed in me. Every friend I saw along the way, every volunteer, every race official: they believed in me.\nSometimes we just need to ignore the doubts within, and let the love and support of others carry us where we need to go. Much more than any \u201cstrength of character\u201d or \u201ciron will,\u201d that\u2019s what got me across the finish line.\nChuck, Colette, me, Clare, Drew, Mariette, and Eddy (Photo credit: unknown)\nLesson #2: Ride the highs. Endure the lows.\nThe human mind is fickle, and it\u2019s really good at tricking us into believing that our reality right now is all there is.\nSitting in that chair at Michigan Bluff, all I could feel was exhaustion and despair.\nMuch earlier, from Mile 31 to Mile 38, as I was speeding down the fastest part of the course, I saw nothing but glory in my future.\nEarlier than that, I felt even better.\nMile 2: fresh as a daisy! (Photo credit: Pen Perez)\nAll of those thoughts and feelings were completely, totally, 100% true and real in the moment.\nSince ups and downs just are, we\u2019re well served by getting better at recognizing them, and at using them in helpful ways.\nHighs offer the chance to \u201clet it ride\u201d: whatever we\u2019re doing comes easily and efficiently. A lot of payoff for a small investment. Enjoy it while it lasts, and get as much done as you can.\nLows teach us to persist, and remind us that there\u2019s always a brighter day ahead.\nJust. Keep. Going.\nLesson #3: A Model for Humanity\nAn ultrarunner friend once asked me, rhetorically: where else other than an ultra is every single person you encounter desperately cheering for you to succeed?\nI\u2019ll add a corollary: What does the existence of such a community tell us about our potential as a species?\nSystems \u2014 including systems of shared behaviors and values, i.e., cultures \u2014 create the context of human relationships, and the conditions of humans\u2019 lives. Ultrarunning has managed to create a culture of deeply committed mutual care and support. I don\u2019t see any ironclad logic that says we can\u2019t create this kind of culture on a global scale. The obstacles are many, and we can\u2019t see the finish line. In a way the journey toward a truly loving future for our species is the ultimate ultramarathon.\nMore to Come\nStay tuned for more posts with lessons from ultrarunning that we can apply in our daily lives and work.\nMeanwhile, some more photos from after the race.\nDusty trails: not a tan line\nAll cleaned up and ready to receive my personally engraved belt buckle\nThe buckle!!!!!\n\u00a0\nIf you have any thoughts to share, I'd love to hear them.

However, sometimes the best sellers don't have the best behaviors. In fact, 84% of buyers say reps don\u2019t convey value effectively.\nGreat sales learning strategies are only as good as the quality of the sales conversations they produce.\nBy leveraging conversation intelligence (CI), sales leaders get more visibility into these conversations and can easily identify and model best behaviors across all your sellers, targeting your learning activities to where, and who, it matters most.\nIn this 30-minute live session, Jake Miller, senior product marketing manager at Allego, will cover:\nKey factors to identify quality sales conversations without CI.\nWhy CI is critical for understanding the value and efficacy of sales learning programs.\nHow to uncover competency gaps and take action.\nThe importance of sharing best practices.\nRegister Now\nOur webinars are pre-qualified for \none credit hour\n with leading HR and training certifications. \nLearn more\n.\n \nTraining Industry, Inc.\u00a0\n110 Horizon Drive, Suite 110\nRaleigh, NC 27615-6520\u00a0\ninfo@trainingindustry.com\n1.866.298.4203\n\u00a0\n \n\u00a9 2023\u00a0Training Industry, Inc.\nEngage with more than 240,000 corporate training leaders.\nGet the \nmedia kit\n or contact us directly at \ninfo@trainingindustry.com\nupdate subscription preferences",

What are the key choices and thoughtful compromises that must be made for workers to thrive as well as produce? How can managers be trained to make the well-being of their workers a top priority? How can companies get a better sense of which benefits and rewards are most effective\u2013and encourage workers to take advantage of them.\u00a0\nFeb. 14, 2024 - \nGetting to the Next Stage of Diversity and Belonging\u00a0\nAt a time of resistance and corporate austerity, DEI advocates will need to re-energize themselves and their organizations with new ideas, programs, and reasoning for the cause of diversity. What can DEI practitioners learn from companies with consistent success? How are companies changing their policies to respond to court rulings and lawsuits? What practices have brought the most progress in bringing diversity to leadership rank\n \nMarch 6, 2024 - \nEmployee Engagement: Tapping the Secrets of Energizing Workers\u00a0\nCompanies want their employees to be enthused and involved, yet employers need to be thoughtful in fostering these qualities in authentic ways. What\u2019s the latest thinking about how employers can understand the motivations of their workers\u2013and how to respond? What are the best methods for recognizing achievement, both individually and among teams? What\u2019s the connection between engagement and job satisfaction? In the hybrid work environment, what binds workers together and wards off anxiety and loneliness?\n \nApril 3, 2024 - \nBenefits that Fit Individual Needs Without Busting the Budge\nHaving made a commitment to recognize the unique needs of individuals, the secret is in the execution. What are the emerging benefits and rewards that workers are seeking, from fertility care to financial wellness? How can companies use technology to stay in close touch with what individuals are experiencing\u2013and where they need help as a result?

Yet this revolution presents new challenges for companies in choosing and supervising these tech tools. How should these tech platforms be evaluated? Which departments of the company should take responsibility\u2013and how can organizations coordinate these moves? How can companies make sure they\u2019re empowering their workers rather than overloading them with adaptation and distraction?\n\u00a0\n \nDec. 11, 2024 - \nPioneering Approaches to Digital Transformation and the Future of Work\n\u00a0\n \nThe emergence of generative AI in 2023 marked the arrival of a transforming technology that will change human roles, add and subtract jobs, and create astounding new capabilities.

Then 20 other attorneys general responded to reassure corporations that their aspirational hiring goals and demographic reporting were legal.\u00a0\nThen there's Target. Remember Target's Pride situation? They received pressure from 7 Republican attorneys general saying Pride month campaigns could violate state child protection laws. Double the amount of Democratic attorneys general wrote to say that state laws against discrimination protect the retailer.\u00a0\nYou may not be getting these letters, but you're not immune to the effects\u00a0\n\ud83d\ude33\nCompanies are in the middle of the culture war and as I've said many times, most organizations are woefully unprepared. Here's another example.\u00a0\nI reviewed content from a company based in Florida that was contacted by an LGBTQ+ advocacy group that let the company know that the political donation it made was to a\u00a0politician who supports the anti-LGBTQ+ legislation in the state. Since the company had an employee contingent marching in the local Pride parade wearing the company's shirts, etc. they may want to know.\u00a0\nThe company responded defensively highlighting a list of community service, basically. They spoke to apples when the advocacy group was talking about oranges.\u00a0\nI'll share what I recommended to them and even draw some stick figures to help paint the picture we're finding ourselves in at a special webinar on Thurs Aug 3, 10am PT/1pm ET.\nREGISTER FOR THE SPECIAL WEBINAR:\nCAUGHT IN THE CULTURE WAR: COMMS' ROLE\nWe need to talk about how we're getting caught in the middle of something our companies feel that they are beyond, or tried to ignore or tried to duck and cover from.\u00a0\nWell, friends, there are fewer and fewer places to hide and we haven't yet hit rock bottom. In the webinar, I'll help connect the dots and speak to how we can be significant drivers to help our organizations navigate our way through this critical time.\nWe have options!\nAs long as we have options, there is hope! I've had several conversations with several clients about what's going on and what I see the trajectory we're on is leading to. I'll share these conversations with you at the webinar. \nCome with your questions and be ready to take notes. There will be action steps. :)\nIn the meantime, stay in the work. Don't get distracted. Be unwavering.\u00a0\nSee you on July 28th for Book Club, Aug 1 for Ask Me Anything and Aug 3rd for the special webinar.

    "body": "Break down geographical barriers with these insights.\n \n \n\u00a0\nHi Hannah,\n\u00a0\nA strong company culture is a crucial component of any successful organization. Not only does it create a sense of belonging among employees that has been shown to boost engagement, performance, and retention, but it also enhances communication, motivation, and the ability to create a psychologically safe environment.\n\u00a0 \nBut while it\u2019s important, it\u2019s not always easy\u2014especially in the remote/hybrid work era, when employees are often distributed around the world and communication is frequently virtual, asynchronous, or both.\n\u00a0 \nThis was the challenge tech startup Alphaus faced as they entered a phase of hyper-growth. With an expanding workforce spread across multiple locations in Japan, Malaysia, and elsewhere, they wanted to evolve the company from a \u201ccozy, family-like, small team\u201d into a \u201cwell-organized, governed group of specialists to pursue higher business goals that cannot be achieved by maintaining the previous team dynamic,\u201d while also maintaining and strengthening the distinctive company culture they had developed from the start.\n\u00a0 \nWant to know how they did it? \nRead this.\n\u00a0\nJoin us at From Day One for free!\nAttuned is thrilled to be part of From Day One\u2019s upcoming virtual conference \u2018\nKeys to Employee Satisfaction, Recognition, and Retention\n\u2019, which takes place from noon to 4.30pm Eastern Time on Wednesday July 26\u2014and we\u2019re offering our newsletter subscribers the chance to join for free!\n\u00a0 \nI\u2019ll be on the panel for \n\u2018Bridging the Distance: How Tech Can Boost Engagement and Recognition\u2019 from 1.20pm-2pm ET,\n alongside Tyler Weeks, Vice President, Talent Analytics at Marriott; Rekha Gurnani, Senior Director, Global Compensation & People Analytics at Box; and Marie Potter, Senior Director of Culture and Development at Getty Images.\nTickets for the conference, which provide access to all sessions, are usually priced $49-$149, but you can \nregister for a free Attuned VIP Ticket here\n.\n\u00a0\nI hope to see you there!\n\u00a0\nCasey\nCasey Wahl\nFounder & CEO\nP.S.

    "body": "Why does it seem increasingly difficult to be in conversation with each other? And, who\u2019s missing from these conversations, as a result?\u00a0\n \nHi Hannah,\n\u00a0\nWhy does it seem increasingly difficult to be in conversation with each other? \nAnd,\n who\u2019s missing from these conversations, as a result?\n\u00a0\nIn our many years of hosting the Better Man Conference and working with thousands of leaders, we\u2019ve met so many who are eager to step into allyship. They know doing nothing isn\u2019t an option, but aren\u2019t certain where they fit into the inclusion equation. Many are striving to build competence, and confidence, to step up, and speak up, but are afraid to say the wrong thing, feeling guilty or even targeted and blamed as the problem.\u00a0\nThe conference was originally created to reframe this experience, and reset our understanding of\n everyone, of every identity\n, as powerful change agents.\u00a0\nBut it \nhas\n become more difficult than ever to practice the imperfect art of allyship - however we identify, because there are few spaces where we can return to the building blocks of inclusion - places where we can deepen our self-awareness, analyze how trust is built, unearth our story, and practice both sharing and listening.\u00a0\nWe are excited to announce the very first \nBetter Together Conference\n, a series of conversations aimed to foster learning, connection, trust, and empathy that include both male leaders and other champions, with the intent of articulating a vision for true partnership that includes and enlists \nall of us\n.\u00a0\nThe conference was born out of - and will continue to center - the idea that we need safe spaces devoid of shame and blame, to ask questions, practice, and learn how to have meaningful and authentic conversations that build bridges across differences. If we don\u2019t, we\u2019ll never have equitable and inclusive cultures where everyone can thrive.\n\u00a0\nLearn more about the conference and secure your ticket while early-bird rates last. We hope you'll come back to the conversations that matter. Join us on \nOctober 18th-19th.\u00a0\nSecure my Ticket\n \nJoin us Today for a LinkedIn Live to Learn More About the Better Together Conference\n\u00a0\nHave questions about the Better Together Conference? Join me and Better Man Movement Founder, Ray Arata today at \n12PM ET\n as we discuss the new conference format, agenda, and what you can expect.\n\u00a0\nAttend the LinkedIn Live\n \nGroup Ticket Packages & Sponsorships\n\u00a0\nThere are currently limited group ticket packages and sponsorships available for organizations who want to be more involved in this transformational event.

When we think about intercultural, we think international, global or worldwide \u2013 but when we think about inclusion, we think local, internal and the workplace. Why are we having these different conversations to the same discourse? What is the breakdown between these two seemingly different sets of vocabulary?\nThis interactive 4-hour session will include videos, polling, and breakout sessions. Participants are encouraged to join using a device that has a camera and a microphone as well as a secondary device like a phone or computer that allows for multiple windows to be open at the same time for the polling.\nParticipants will discuss and reflect on:\nThe words we use to describe others\nHistorical perspectives on these two lexicons\nGlobal vs Local\nThe direction of impact: who is studying who?\nAt the conclusion of the presentation, participants will have:\nA greater recognition of how inclusion and intercultural fit together.\nThe basic awareness of how we present ourselves in an environment or culture that is not necessarily our own.\nStrategies to be more aware of where we are as professionals.\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nRegistration Fees\n$20 for Students\n$45 for current SIETAR USA members in good standing\n$65 for non-members\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nStudent-Register \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nMember-Register \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nNon-Member-Register \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nYour Seminar Leader\nJay Cafferata, MS, CDE\nMr. Cafferata is a well-known speaker and advocate for issues involving Diversity, Equity, Inclusion, and Belonging.

The hoped-for progress toward diversity, equity, and inclusion has prompted a backlash. And workers are mostly done quitting en masse, but their expectations about job satisfaction have only grown. On top of these issues, the arrival of generative AI is going to change virtually everyone's job. Company leaders will need to face fresh challenges, and From Day One's conferences in 2024 will be bringing them the latest ideas about these developing stories.\"\nWhether in person or online, From Day One\u2019s accredited events\u00a0bring together top executives and decision makers in HR, benefits, diversity, corporate culture, employee engagement, and corporate responsibility to discuss timely themes like hybrid work, employee benefits, diversity and inclusion, social impact, and employee well-being.\u00a0\nFrom Day One is recognized as the\u00a0pre-eminent\u00a0forum for corporate-values discussions. The company\u2019s in-person events break the typical conference mold by presenting in inspiring spaces, including art museums, opera houses, and centers of community gathering. From Day One was among the first to convene executives to address subjects like balancing productivity with well-being, developing diversity in leadership, supporting working parents, hybrid work, and offering better career paths, and the firm expects further evolution in the ways businesses and society will interact next year.\nEven as the company looks ahead to 2024, this year still has several From Day One conferences remaining in 2023. The company will travel to \nBoston\n on Sept. 12, \nManhattan\n on Sept. 26, \nPhiladelphia\n on Oct. 3, \nDenver\n on Oct. 18, \nLos Angeles\n on Nov. 2, and \nMiami\n on Nov. 14. From Day One also holds virtual events and webinars every week; find the schedule of upcoming events at\n fromdayone.co\n.\nThe full slate of 2024 in-person and virtual dates is below. In-person dates are preliminary and subject to change. Speakers and participants will be announced in the months leading up to the events.

What are the key choices and thoughtful compromises that must be made for workers to thrive as well as produce? How can managers be trained to make the well-being of their workers a top priority? How can companies get a better sense of which benefits and rewards are most effective\u2013and encourage workers to take advantage of them?\nFeb. 14, 2024\nGetting to the Next Stage of Diversity and Belonging\u00a0\nAt a time of resistance and corporate austerity, DEI advocates will need to re-energize themselves and their organizations with new ideas, programs, and reasoning for the cause of diversity. What can DEI practitioners learn from companies with consistent success? How are companies changing their policies to respond to court rulings and lawsuits? What practices have brought the most progress in bringing diversity to leadership ranks?\nMarch 6, 2024\nEmployee Engagement: Tapping the Secrets of Energizing Workers\u00a0\nCompanies want their employees to be enthused and involved, yet employers need to be thoughtful in fostering these qualities in authentic ways. What\u2019s the latest thinking about how employers can understand the motivations of their workers\u2013and how to respond? What are the best methods for recognizing achievement, both individually and among teams? What\u2019s the connection between engagement and job satisfaction? In the hybrid work environment, what binds workers together and wards off anxiety and loneliness?\u00a0\nApril 3, 2024\nBenefits that Fit Individual Needs Without Busting the Budget\nHaving made a commitment to recognize the unique needs of individuals, the secret is in the execution. What are the emerging benefits and rewards that workers are seeking, from fertility care to financial wellness? How can companies use technology to stay in close touch with what individuals are experiencing\u2013and where they need help as a result? How can companies choose among myriad point solutions and innovative new platforms? What are the most cost-effective rewards in terms of investments and outcomes?\nMay 22, 2024\nThe Art and Science of Employee Retention, Coaching and Advancement\nWhile the pace of job-hopping has eased, employers have a powerful motivation to retain skilled workers, both for financial and cultural reasons. How can employers use new tools, including AI, to gain insights about what\u2019s inspiring their workers to stay committed\u2013or walk out the door? Since attrition is often caused by poor relationships with managers, what are innovative ways for employers to train their workers to be better leaders at a time when workers have higher expectations for job satisfaction? How can technology help make coaching more effective?\nJune 12, 2024\nBringing Talent Acquisition into the Digital Age\u00a0\nDespite layoffs making headlines now, all the demographic and digital trends point toward tough competition for workers in the future\u2013maybe sooner than most expect. What are the new techniques and tools that talent-acquisition can use to envision the workforce their company will need in the future? What data and insights can HR and TA leaders provide to the company to be ahead of trends? How can companies do a better job of internal recruiting and promoting internal mobility? What are the best practices for hiring based on skills and potential, rather than credentials?\nJuly 10, 2024\nLearning and Development: How New Tools Are Changing Upskilling and Career Mobility\u00a0\nAs employers put more emphasis on skills as the currency for worker development, they\u2019re seeking new ways to measure them, fill in gaps, and predict the skills needed in the future. How can these new tools, including AI, create better matches between employees and projects? How can employers gain insights from the data they gather? Why do real-world simulations help measure certain skills better than traditional assessments?\u00a0\nJuly 17, 2024\nInnovative Benefits That Support Healthy Families and Caregivers\nAs the pandemic\u2019s caregiving crisis showed, employers found significant gaps in their support for the parents and other caregivers in their workforces. The resulting scramble to help has produced a wealth of new HR policies, benefit offerings, and management practices. Where is the greatest demand for support, as well as the most innovative new methods? What have been the most cost-effective ways to help caregivers of all kinds, including parents as well as \u201csandwich generation\u201d workers caring for elderly and disabled relatives?\u00a0\nAug. 7, 2024\nEmployee Engagement: Using Technology to Gain Insight Into Work Needs and Ambitions\u00a0\nTraditional methods like town-hall meetings and surveys can be effective, but data and well-drawn insights can give top leaders a heads up about evolving patterns and trends in their workforces. How can AI and other technology be deployed in a way that brings new insights yet still respects privacy and the individual human factors at play? What approaches will bring employers new empathy for worker needs, ambitions, and well-being?\u00a0\nAug. 28, 2024\nPursuing Higher Productivity With Human Factors in Mind\nIn a competitive and uncertain climate, most companies need to do more with less. Yet if workers are their greatest asset, employers need to make sure the push for greater output is sustainable. What is the latest thinking about how to measure productivity, the means for stimulating it, and ensuring that workers have the energy to meet their goals\u2013as well as thrive over the long run?\n\u00a0\nSept. 18, 2024\nBuilding a Corporate Culture That Workers Can Understand, Influence and Embrace \n\u00a0\nCompany culture is amorphous yet vital\u2013the shared beliefs, values, traditions and behaviors that drive the actions of individuals and the organization as a whole. Who should be the architects of a company\u2019s culture and how should it be designed and constructed? How should the culture be communicated, broadly and in everyday actions? How should a company start out on a project to evolve its culture in a credible way?\u00a0\u00a0\nOct. 16, 2024\nModernizing Your Workplace for a More Flexible, Inclusive Era\nThe arrival of hybrid work sent virtually every employer back to the drawing board about what the workplace should look like, including floor plans, digital platforms, meetings, and even office furniture. After more than three years of experimenting, what have innovative companies discovered about what works\u2013and what doesn\u2019t? How have they improved workplace environments to be healthier, as well as more productive? How have these changes affected the goals of diversity, equity, inclusion, and belonging?\nNov. 20, 2024\nFinding and Deploying HR Tech That Will Empower Workers \n\u00a0\nThe blossoming of innovation in HR technology has given employers untold new abilities to organize, inspire, develop, reward, and care for their workers. Yet this revolution presents new challenges for companies in choosing and supervising these tech tools. How should these tech platforms be evaluated? Which departments of the company should take responsibility\u2013and how can organizations coordinate these moves? How can companies make sure they\u2019re empowering their workers rather than overloading them with adaptation and distraction?\nDec. 11, 2024\nPioneering Approaches to Digital Transformation and the Future of Work\nThe emergence of generative AI in 2023 marked the arrival of a transforming technology that will change human roles, add and subtract jobs, and create astounding new capabilities. How can companies manage the transition, both from the short-term competitive pressures to\u00a0 long-term corporate survival? How can AI be used to unleash creativity? Where are the areas for abuse, intentional or otherwise? How will digital transformation affect fields from talent acquisition to learning and development?\u00a0\n\u00a0\nABOUT FROM DAY ONE\nFrom Day One is a conference series and media outlet focused on innovative ways for companies to foster stronger relationships with their employees, customers, and communities.

It's been non-stop on the DEI front and I hope you've been able to get a break and rest. After the recent US Supreme Court decisions, we need some ice on our forehead from the headaches, pain and chaos it's creating. \nIn the absence of clarity, we have chaos\n \nWhen we have chaos we have dissonance. When we have dissonance we trigger worry, anxiety, and stress. That puts the brakes on progress. It then puts people up against each other rather than bringing people together. This is where we step up as DEI communicators. \nIt's a time to lean on what we have committed to and show up. You can see the posts I made on Affirmative Action about organizations \nsaying something\n and what it sets in motion for \nfuture talent\n.\nThree years ago this summer, many of us were out in the streets\n \nSummer 2020 was my impetus to write \nThe Conscious Communicator. \nMy clients will say that they've done a lot of good and they believed they were doing the right thing and that's valid. \nHowever, our commitments were built on sand, blown over by the whiff of a storm or pushback. We're seeing where our strategies aren't strong, have holes, or are too shallow.\nTo be fair, we often don't understand the depth of a commitment until we're in the midst of trying to keep it\nThis is frickin' hard work. A lot of variables and personalities. \nWe've seen the surge of wanting to talk about societal issues and now we're seeing the rolling back, the shielding and folding. It's time to do something different. \nWe know better. \nWe know we need DEPTH. \nTailored is the bridge to hesitant leaders\nThis month's Book Club and Community meet up is focusing on the chapter, \"T is for Tailored\". It's the bridge to engage leaders, HR and Legal.\nOur organization doesn't have to do \"all the things\" externally. However, we do have to do our part and collectively we'll get the work done. \nTailored is about having that strategic conversation that ties our core capabilities to what our \"lane\" is in the work. It is the catalyst for proactive positioning us authentically and meaningfully on social topics. \nAmazing work comes from this alignment. It relieves pressure and builds trust with employees and customers while protecting brand reputation. \nIt helps with feeling stuck between \"you're not doing enough\" and \"you're doing too much\", which makes some organizations end up not doing anything...and friends, that's not an option (\nread Edelman's Trust Barometer)\n.\nLet's build our strategy on rock\nWe have to be strategic and intentional and there's a method to do just that: The DEPTH Model. \nSet up some time with me\n and I'll walk you through the process. \nTogether, we can lower defenses, get the conversation going, have it be productive, and get us to a position where we can stand and withstand because, simply, employees and customers expect it. \nSkoden (let's go then!)\nkim\nPS: I also made a post on \nFreedom and the 4th of July\n set in the context of how I celebrated as a kid and having no idea what this holiday meant for my grandmother, the matriarch of our Muscogee Nation lineage. \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nThis podcast is \nmade just for you. \n\u00a0\nCommunicate Like You Give a Damn is a new weekly podcast where we explore the communicator's role and responsibility in Diversity, Equity and Inclusion (DEI) work.

    "subject": "From Day One: The Diversity Backlash Is Here",
    "body": "The backlash against diversity, equity, and inclusion (DEI) is in full swing. DEI programs are now a campaign issue, with more legislatures seeking to ban DEI efforts altogether. Boycotts have shaken brands. \nCorporate DEI budgets have been cut\n, while surveys show a rising tide of \u201cdiversity fatigue.\u201d DEI leaders, once given a mandate to help companies \u201cdo better,\u201d have grown dispirited.\u00a0\n\u00a0\nThe \nSupreme Court\u2019s 6-3 decision\n on June 27, striking down affirmative action in higher education, was widely anticipated by the business community. A friend-of-the court brief was filed by dozens of technology, finance, and health care companies who support DEI. Ranging from \nAmerican Express to Walgreens\n, companies pleaded with the court that they rely on \u201cracially and ethnic diverse student bodies\u201d to find talent.\u00a0\n\u00a0\nWe've secured an exclusive opportunity for our members to take part \nin AARP's Employee Caregiver Program Series. This series, free of charge for From Day One subscribers, is an easy way to make your workplace more caregiver-inclusive via live virtual programs on a range of challenges that working family caregivers face at home and work. To learn more and reserve a spot, visit\u00a0\n \nhttps://caregiving.fromdayone.co/\n.\n\u00a0\nThere will be workplace ramifications, even though the case applied to higher education. Questions arose in many workplaces: Will DEI programs now be weakened or banned? Can race be considered in employment decisions? Will an activist Supreme Court look for a case in which to extend its educational dictates to the workplace?\n\u00a0\nLegal and HR experts advise DEI advocates to be proactive. Here are five steps you can take, as reported by From Day One contributor Andrea Sachs:\n\u00a0\nRemind Stakeholders Why DEI Is Beneficial\n\u00a0\nDEI is both morally right and beneficial to the bottom line. \u201cStudy after study demonstrates that, across organizations, diversity enhances \ncritical thinking, creativity and collaboration\n, as well as productivity, profitability and \nperformance\n,\u201d \nwrote Ford Foundation CEO Darren Walker\n in the \nNew York Times\n.\u00a0\n\u00a0\nMake Sure Your DEI Programs Aren\u2019t in Conflict With Current Laws\n\u00a0\nReview your employee handbook, DEI framework, and other written policies with legal and employment-law experts. \u201cBe sure your policies and programs don\u2019t unintentionally run afoul of anti-discrimination laws. Quotas and preferences\u2013as well as perceived unfairness\u2013can create legal problems,\u201d \nadvises the Fisher Phillips law firm\n.\u00a0\n\u00a0\nNYU legal experts Kenji Yoshino and David Glasgow, \nauthors of a book\n on how to talk about DEI, \noffer instructions\n for a \u201cself-audit\u201d to avoid legal exposure. They suggest sorting programs as red (high risk), yellow (medium risk), and green (low risk). But they discourage knee-jerk changes: \u201cCompanies are still allowed to strive for a diverse workforce.\u201d\u00a0\n\u00a0\nTake Steps to Avoid the Possibility of a Reverse Discrimination Lawsuit\n\u00a0\nCorporate DEI programs surged\n after the murder of George Floyd. The result has been a legal backlash by right-wing activists and legislators, and that trend is expected to intensify. America First Legal, headed by former Donald Trump adviser Stephen Miller, has filed complaints with the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission, asking it to investigate diversity and hiring practices at companies like McDonald\u2019s and Unilever. In June, a jury in New Jersey ordered Starbucks to pay a white former manager $25.6 million, finding she had been fired because of reverse discrimination.\n\u00a0\nAlthough reverse-discrimination claims are not new, the risk of incurring them may be increased. Employers should research state legislation restricting DEI initiatives, as in Florida and Texas. But Alvin B. Tillery, Jr., director of the Center for Study of Diversity and Democracy, cautions against overreacting.\n Tillery told the \nNew York Times\n, \u201cI do worry about corporate counsels who see their main job as keeping organizations from getting sued\u2014I do worry about hyper-compliance.\u201d\n\u00a0\nExplore New Ways of Growing Your Candidate Pool\n\u00a0\nBusinesses\n depend on higher education\n to provide diverse candidates. That flow will be stanched by the court\u2019s decision. \u201cI don\u2019t believe that there\u2019s a dispute that university demographics will become more homogenous,\u201d said Janine Yancey, founder and CEO of\n Emtrain\n, an inclusion-and-belonging consultancy. This will lead to \u201ca smaller talent pipeline,\u201d she told From Day One.\u00a0\n\u00a0\nIt has\n occurred already\n in the nine states that have banned race-conscious affirmative action. After California voters enacted a ban on affirmative action in 1996, the number of Black students at the University of California campuses in Berkeley and Los Angeles plummeted. Since Michigan ended affirmative action in 2006, the number of Black students at the University of Michigan has dropped dramatically.\n\u00a0\nEmployers will need to cast a wider net for a diverse workforce. Rhonda V. Sharpe, founder and president of the\n Women\u2019s Institute for Science, Equity, and Race\n, sees a silver lining. Said Sharpe, \u201cI will not shed a tear for affirmative action but will rejoice in the possibilities for Historically Black Colleges and Hispanic Serving Institutions.\u201d\u00a0\u00a0\n\u00a0\nThe impact of affirmative action was mostly in elite universities. \u201cThe majority of Black and Hispanic students attend universities that accept more than three-quarters of their applicants,\u201d\n wrote academics Richard Arum and Mitchell L. Stevens in the \nNew York Times\n.\n \u201cThe current opportunity to bring equity to American higher education lies in a collective re-commitment to the quality and success of more accessible institutions.\u201d Experts recommend HR leaders look even further upstream, investing in programs to develop underserved youth earlier in life.\n\u00a0\nPut More Stress on Employee Retention\n\u00a0\nWith a less diverse candidate pool, retaining a representative workforce could become difficult. \u201cNo one wants to work in an environment where they are \u2018the only,\u2019\u201d Janice Gassam Asure, founder of BWG Business Solutions, a consultancy that helps organizations create inclusive environments, wrote in \nForbes\n. She warns the decision \u201cwill not only make it more challenging to retain the employees you already have, but it will likely be more difficult to attract new talent from underrepresented communities.\u201d\n\u00a0\nIt is important right now to consider employee sentiment. Y-Vonne Hutchinson, CEO of DEI consulting and strategy firm \nReadySet\n, asserts: \u201cYour employees, particularly those from historically marginalized backgrounds, may be experiencing anxiety, stress, sadness, fear, and disappointment right now.\u201d Hutchinson urges companies to provide support in the form of employment resource groups and mental health resources.\n\u00a0\nStalwarts like Iesha Berry, chief diversity and engagement officer and head of people experience at DocuSign, have no intention of giving in to right-wing pressure. \u201cIt doesn\u2019t change our focus,\u201d \nshe told the \nWall Street Journal\n. Diversity is \u201cnot a stand-alone, and it\u2019s not something that is the flavor of the day, but critically important to the business and the business success.\u201d \nRead the full story here\n.\n\u00a0 \nWEBINAR RECAP\n\u00a0 \nEquitable Rewards: Do you have Pride in Your Benefits? \nA good benefits package ranks among the top three most important factors for job satisfaction, according to a \nsurvey\n from the Society for Human Resource Management. But the usual benefits plans aren\u2019t keeping up with what employees want and need. Your existing employees may be shopping around for packages that better suit their needs, said Corrinne Hobbs, VP\u00a0of business development at \nOvia Health\n, a family health benefits platform. \u201cWe learned that 91% of our members would consider a lateral move to a place with better family benefits and a family friendly culture,\u201d Hobbs said. For BIPOC and LGBTQ+ employees, inclusive benefits can encourage well-being, team retention, and a more diverse workforce. \nRead the full story here\n.\u00a0\n\u00a0 \nLIVE CONFERENCE HIGHLIGHTS\n\u00a0 \nWhy Career Growth Is a Mutual Benefit for Both Workers and Employers: \nAccording to Pew Research, 63% of people who left jobs in 2021 cited\n a lack of advancement opportunities\n. \u201cWe spend a lot of time and energy focusing on what an employee really wants,\u201d said Joji Gill, VP of HR\n at Applied Materials\n. \u201cWe realized, as our demographics have changed, that we actually did not understand.\u201d Gill\u2019s team learned to enable supervisors as coaches. \u201cAn employee really owns their careers, but we facilitate it through their managers and through the opportunities we provide,\" Gill said, speaking to a panel of HR leaders moderated by\u00a0Dan Ashley of \nABC7 KGO-TV Bay Area\n\u00a0at From Day One\u2019s\n San Francisco conference\n. \nRead the full story here\n.\u00a0\n\u00a0\nHow to Give Workers the Resources and Opportunities They Need to Thrive: \nAt a time of uncertainty and rapid change, the keys to a happy workplace are flexibility and intentionality. So says Jessica Swank, chief people officer for\n Box, Inc.\n, a Silicon Valley cloud content-management company that is consistently rated a \u201c\nGreat Place to Work\n.\u201d Like most tech companies prior to the pandemic, Box operated largely in person. Now, after many iterations of working remotely, employees have embraced a hybrid approach. Swank spoke with Erin Griffith, a \nNew York Times \nreporter, in a fireside chat at From Day One\u2019s\n San Francisco\n conference. As arrangements sort themselves out post-pandemic, employee preferences vary widely. Some workers may want to return to the office for in-person mentorship. Others who are caretakers of children or elderly parents, or both, have contrasting needs. \nRead the full story here\n.\u00a0\n\u00a0\nBeyond Group Benefits: Supporting the Employee\u2019s Whole Self at Work: \nThree weeks after Israel Gutierrez joined \nAxios\n in 2022 as vice president of talent acquisition, his brother passed away. Along with the emotional toll, funeral costs were outrageous. Fortunately, Axios had implemented an Axios Family Fund in response to Covid, investing $100,000 for employees in need. As a new hire, Gutierrez was reluctant to apply. His boss said, \u201cJust do it.\u201d Axios made accessing funds easy, fast, and confidential with only three people in the loop. At the June \nFrom Day One conference in Austin,\n a panel moderated by \nAustin Business Journal\u2019s\n Sahar Chmais discussed how supporting the whole individual at work is about so much more than offering generous benefits. \nRead the full story here\n.\u00a0\n\u00a0 \nVIRTUAL EVENT HIGHLIGHTS\n\u00a0 \nFostering an Inclusive Work Environment: Embracing Diversity in Every Form: \nDiversity is not limited to identities that are visible upon first meeting someone. Kristen Carlisle, VP and general manager at \nBetterment\n, has been living with an auto-immune condition for ten years. Dave Wilkin, founder of \n10kc.com\n, grew up a gay, STEM-loving kid in a small town who would never have gone to college without a scholarship. Timothy Fair, VP of DEI at \nBurlington\n, is proud of his religious identity: \u201cI am deeply guided by an identity that\u2019s usually invisible,\u201d he told journalist Lydia Dishman in a panel at \nFrom Day One\u2019s June virtual conference\n\u00a0about how we think about DEI. \u201cThose principles have really guided the way I see the world and how the world sees me,\u201d said Fair. \nRead the full story here\n.\u00a0\n\u00a0\nThe Zigzag Career:\u00a0Why This Microsoft Executive Is a Believer in Reskilling.\u00a0\nAs technology charges forward, reskilling and upskilling have emerged as alternatives for closing talent gaps. Upskilling programs can help top performers discover what lights them up, increasing retention and engagement. For one executive, pursuing new opportunities led to a rewarding career. \u201cI'm a believer in what I call the \u2018zigzag career\u2019 and shifting around,\u201d said Carlos Pardo, chief learning officer at \nMicrosoft \nLatin America. After starting with Microsoft as an intern, Pardo worked in finance, operations, marketing, and sales before landing his current position. These moves and opportunities for coaching and upskilling were vital, he said in a fireside chat at the June conference. \nRead the full story here\n.\u00a0\u00a0\n\u00a0\nEngaging an Increasingly Diverse Early-Career Workforce: \nYoung people entering the workforce are unafraid to ask for things their predecessors shied away from. Generation Z applicants typically pose blunt questions when evaluating an employer, said Dexter Davis, VP of HR and DEI at \nEcolab\n. \u201cIt\u2019s specifically, \u2018What are the things you\u2019re doing? How are you ensuring equity?\u2019 And how soon can they be part of the organization and have a voice?\u2019\u201d At the June conference,\n\u00a0\na panel of five talent acquisition and DEI leaders\u2014Davis among them\u2014spoke about the ways employers are attracting and keeping young workers. \nRead the full story here\n.\u00a0\n\u00a0 \nQUICK HITS\n\u00a0 \nWhat Climate Changes Has to Do With the Looming UPS Union Strike: \nAcross the U.S., according to \nTime\n, UPS drivers are braving one of the most immediate aspects of\n climate change\n: longer, more intense heat waves that make long hours in wheeled ovens not just uncomfortable but dangerous. On June 25, 2022, Esteban Chavez, 24,\n died of suspected heat stroke\n delivering packages in Pasadena, on a day with temperatures in the high 90s. Weeks later, a driver\n collapsed on a customer\u2019s doorstep\n in Arizona when the temperature hit 110\u00b0F. More than 143 UPS employees have been hospitalized for heat injuries between 2015 and 2022, according to\n company records\n. Still, UPS refused to air-condition their familiar dark brown trucks. On June 16, UPS\u2019s 340,000 Teamsters union members voted to strike starting August 1, unless demands for improved working conditions, including air-conditioned vehicles and ice for coolers at cargo centers, were included in a five-year contract. \nRead the full story here\n.\u00a0\n\u00a0\nAmericans Have Quit Quitting Their Jobs: \nThe surge in Americans quitting their jobs has abated\u2013a trend \nThe Wall Street Journal \nconsiders a sign that the labor market is cooling from ultra-hot levels as the Federal Reserve raises interest rates. Americans voluntarily left 4 million jobs in May, the Labor Department said. That marked a drop of around 500,000 from 4.5 million in November 2021, the highest level in Labor Department records back to 2000. The so-called quits rate\u2014the number of resignations as a share of total employment\u2014 averaged 2.5% from March to May, down from 3% as recently as April 2022, and only slightly higher than the pre-pandemic level. \nRead the full story here\n.\u00a0\n\u00a0\nThe Boomers Are Retiring: See Why That\u2019s Bad News for Workers: \nRanks of retirees are growing much faster today than the number of new workers, ushering in an unprecedented graying of America that will reshape our workforce and economy. For 50 years, boomers, born between 1946 and 1964, have worked through the American labor force like a big meal inside an anaconda. As they age, the workforce is becoming older than ever. As they retire, they\u2019ll push the worker-to-retiree ratio lower than ever. Lower numbers of workers per retiree threaten programs like Social Security and Medicare, which support older Americans by taxing workers. As the share of working Americans shrinks, that money will, too. Both programs \nface funding shortfalls\n in the next decade without higher taxes or cuts to benefits, the \nWashington Post \nreported. \nRead the full story here\n.\u00a0\n\u00a0 \nSPONSOR SPOTLIGHTS\n\u00a0 \nSTORK CLUB\n\u00a0\nHow Employers Are Making Family-Building Benefits More Inclusive: \nNow that employers are more cognizant of the myriad ways families can operate, they\u2019re removing barriers to reproductive health and family-building benefits. An example: \u201cHistorically speaking, women would require a diagnosis of infertility to receive access to artificial insemination in vitro fertilization,\u201d said Serafina Miller, senior principal consultant with the \nhealth practice at Mercer\n. But this is changing, Miller said. In the webinar \u201cWhy Family-Building Benefits Are a Critical Business Need,\u201d Miller spoke with Liz Pittinger, head of global customer success at family-health benefits provider\n Stork Club\n, about popular and innovative additions to health care packages that support the needs of diverse workforces. \nRead the full story here\n.\n\u00a0\nTHINKHUMAN\n\u00a0\nInclusive Leadership Development for People Leaders at Your Organization: \nAmerican businesses are spending more than \n$8 billion per year\n to combat bias and expand diversity, equity, inclusion and belonging. The bad news, according to leadership consultancy \nThinkHuman\n founder and CEO Meredith Haberfeld, is that many well-intentioned initiatives can prove counterproductive. \u201cIn a meta-analysis of more than 490 studies involving some 80,000 people, the psychologist \nPatrick Forscher\n and his colleagues found that unconscious bias training did not change behavior,\u201d said Haberfeld. So how can businesses build an effective and efficient program that truly improves diversity, equity, inclusion, and belonging? Haberfeld shared insights in a talk at \nFrom Day One\u2019s June virtual conference\n. \nRead the full story here\n.\nWORKTANGO\n\u00a0\nThe Evolution of Employee Recognition and Rewards: Trends and Best Practices.\u00a0\nLongevity isn\u2019t an accurate or productive measurement of true employee engagement. In fact, \u201c94% of organizations have employee recognition and rewards programs, yet only one-third of those are effective,\u201d according to Merrily McGugan the VP\u00a0of brand and communications at \nWorkTango\n. What does it mean to have an effective rewards and recognition program? We all work harder when we know we\u2019re appreciated, morale is also better and people tend to stay longer. \u201cCompanies that excel at employee recognition are 12x more likely to generate strong business results than their peers who are not doing it,\u201d said McGugan during her talk at \nFrom Day One\u2019s Austin conference\n. What are some best practices companies can easily implement? McGugan offers seven ideas. \nRead the full story here\n.\nTHE FELLOWSHIP\nThe Making of a Master Builder of a Strong Company Culture: \nA company\u2019s culture can be challenging to define, let alone build. Kelly Ann Doherty, chief administrative officer of the home-loan provider\n Mr. Cooper Group\n, takes an architectural approach that has helped earn the company a reputation as a\n Great Place to Work\n. Doherty\u2019s own trajectory is a case study on how a leader can learn to successfully communicate the beliefs and behaviors that guide the actions of individuals as well as the company as a whole. Doherty traces her growing mastery to her attendance in 2018 at\n The Fellowship\n, a four-day master class in organizational culture for HR leaders in Santa Fe, N.M. Doherty was always passionate about building her career around people, and knew that communicating culture was part of her role as Mr. Cooper Group\u2019s chief communications officer. However, it wasn\u2019t until she attended The Fellowship that she saw what a career in building culture could look like. \nRead the full story here\n.\nAARP\nFinding Purpose: What Older Workers Say They Want in a Job: \nThe number of older workers \nis growing\n, prompting a closer look at what job characteristics are important to members of this experienced talent pool. Over the next decade, three in 10 Americans ages 65 to 74 are projected to be in the workforce, up from 26% of that age group in 2021, according to the Bureau of Labor Statistics. \u201cGains in longevity mean that our younger workers are looking at extended careers, and that the five-generation workforce is likely going to be the norm moving forward,\u201d Heather Tinsley-Fix, a senior advisor for financial resilience at \nAARP\n, said in a presentation at From Day One\u2019s June virtual conference.

What are the newest and most effective rewards, ranging from relocation programs and scholarships to management development and employee recognition? How can companies evaluate these diverse programs in a way that has emotional impact but represent efficient business practices? \nRegister now\n.\n\u00a0\nAug. 8: Filling the Gaps in Your Healthcare Benefits to Make Them More Inclusive. \nTo provide personalized medical-benefit plans for an increasingly diverse workforce, employers need to find the shortcomings in their offerings and explore innovative ways to fix them. Workers today have higher expectations when it comes to employer support for family-building, wellness, and mental health. What kind of surveys and other tools can companies use to assess the needs of their workforce? In a marketplace with many point solutions, how can employers find the right mix for their workers? From the point of view of the employees, what are the most inclusive ways to help them navigate the complex healthcare system? \nRegister now\n.\nAug. 15: Mind Over Money: Boosting Employee Mental Health by Reducing Their Financial Stress. \nThe connection is dramatic: nearly 86% of employees say that their personal finances are one of the top stressors in their lives, harming their mental health and happiness. Yet there's a remedy: the vast majority of workers who enrolled in an employer-based financial wellness program say their financial stress was reduced.

But many organizations drift into the opposite condition. They suffer from ineffective practices for diversity, equity, and inclusion (DEI). One of the symptoms is inadvertently excluding some in an attempt to include others. How can companies recognize when they need an intervention? What steps should they take to reverse the syndrome\u2013and who should manage the process? What will it look like when they embed belonging at the team and organizational level? \nRegister now\n.\u00a0\u00a0\n\u00a0\nSept. 19: Ageism in Industries. \nAgeism remains the open secret in the advertising, marketing, and branding categories. Subtle discrimination is vaguely disguised in commercials and employer branding, especially in the beauty and tech industries. Often the About Us and Meet our Team landing pages can tell you more about a brand than the nicely polished imagery. If you\u2019re an organization that struggles to attract and retain experienced talent, join AARP Senior Advisor Heather Tinsley-Fix and New & Improved Principal Lisa Balser for a discussion on how ageism shows up in marketing and how employers can signal and implement a more inclusive culture. They\u2019ll cover age discrimination trends and how they adversely affect an organization\u2019s strategic goals; the silent signals of ageism in your organization, from client-facing work to internal workflows and decisions; and strategies to become more age-inclusive, not just in your marketing strategy but in creating teams. \nRegister now\n.\u00a0\n\u00a0\nOct. 10: Why Women\u2019s Health Benefits Are Essential to Retention, Affordability. \nWomen\u2019s health can be a high cost driver for employers.

Yet health and well-being among employees goes beyond acute or specific physical or mental health needs. How can companies create a culture that emphasizes health through everyday experience? What are the hidden opportunities to nurture this kind of culture? Rather than relying only on standard\u00a0benefits to respond in times of unexpected distress, how can organizations address employee needs proactively? \nRegister here to attend\n.\u00a0\n\u00a0\nSept. 27: \nGiving Workers Direction About Skills and Career Development\n. \nMany workers yearn to grow and advance in their careers, yet don\u2019t have an understanding of how to develop their skills and experience\u00a0for a role with more responsibility. Learning and\u00a0development can help not only by showing the many possibilities, but also with vision to help employees find the learning and development path that will enable the most fulfilling growth according to their own interests.

But camaraderie and a sense of belonging have proven elusive without meaningful face-to-face contact and team-building opportunities. How can organizations create new structures for in-person gatherings that maintain the comfort of remote or hybrid work, as well as new digital approaches that create the ties that bind? \nRegister here to attend\n.\u00a0\n\u00a0\nNov. 8: \nCasting a Wider Net: Fresh, Productive Approaches to Diversity Recruiting\n. \nMany companies fall short of their diversity-hiring goals because they keep looking in the same places\u2013and with the same techniques and expectations. What are the best ways for employers to break out of these patterns? How can they reconsider their job specifications to bring in more non-traditional candidates and prospects who could thrive with a modest amount of training and upskilling?

Short.\nAudience:\n All employees, participation is optional but strongly suggested\nFormat:\n There will be 5-6 meetings, every 2 weeks, and we\u2019ll read roughly 10-20 pages per meeting (the book is under 200 pages).\n\u00a0\nLearning in Relationships\n is very actionable with s\npecific maps, methods, and models to put into immediate use and \nprepares readers\n to respond to the following truths:\nCommunicating is not about doing it right the first time. It is about learning from each other especially when communications go wrong.\nThe information we need to learn is always present, all the time, always here and now.\nThe book starts with a series of short thinking lessons that help the reader locate the source of the communication problem not within the other person, but inside oneself. \nThe book then puts the reader--not the other person(s)--in charge, knowing that abstract organizations don't change, only individuals change. . . who then work together to make changes in their specific relationship and organization.\nAs with the first Learner\u2019s Lounge, this meeting is optional but strongly suggested. Of course, we encourage the opportunity to learn and grow in our communication, leadership development, and anti-racist practices. As Sarah mentioned before, we want LCW to be an organization that practices what we preach. We hope you will find time to read the book with a focus on introspection and reflection and are happy to keep the option\n \nto organize a 1:1 with a staff member if you wish to have an individual thought partner in processing it or can\u2019t make the meetings and would still like to discuss the book.\n\u00a0\n________________________________________________________________________________\n \nMicrosoft Teams meeting\n \nJoin on your computer, mobile app or room device\n \nClick here to join the meeting\n \nMeeting ID: \n256 289 351 214\n \nPasscode: \nvbdPfL \nDownload Teams\n | \nJoin on the web\nOr call in (audio only)\n \n+1 872-239-8243,,777061528#\n \n\u00a0 United States, Chicago \nPhone Conference ID: \n777 061 528# \nFind a local number\n | \nReset PIN\n \nLearn More\n | \nMeeting options\n \n________________________________________________________________________________",

I know I did for many years.\n\u00a0 \nBut then I made a discovery that changed everything.\n\u00a0 \nIt\u2019s such a simple concept that I can\u2019t believe it didn\u2019t occur to me sooner, but since I started implementing it, it has completely transformed how I manage people from generations that came to the workforce before and after me.\n\u00a0 \nIt's easy to learn, quick to implement, and you can \nread all about it here.\n\u00a0\nHave a motivating day!\n\u00a0\nCasey\nCasey Wahl\nFounder & CEO\nP.S.

A lot has happened since we last connected. Let's catch up...\nPride Month 2023 is historical. Starting with the over 550 anti-LGBTQ+ bills in play in the U.S., Uganda's new law that includes the death penalty for 'aggravated homosexuality', Texas' governor closing DEI offices at Universities.\nThen there's Bud Light, Target and Starbucks to name a few examples of how\u00a0much companies need The DEPTH Model to do better. Think of the money, time, reputation, frustrations, meetings, and cyclical discussions spent when it could have been avoided by The DEPTH Model. When will we learn?\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nBeing on the road in several cities this month, Toronto was the most visibly supportive of Pride. Everywhere one looked downtown, there was some signage, story, or statement. \nSome messaging still needed some work, like the window cling that said Everyone Deserves Pizza at a pizza restaurant. Access to pizza isn't what the Stonewall riots in 1969 were fighting for. Pizza doesn't keep me and my community members safe and alive. But I appreciate the acknowledgment.\u00a0\nWhile I was in Nashville, I met with folks who are directly impacted by the rhetoric and actions taking place. Pride events had to increase security and yet the resolve and commitment to show up and tell our stories is inspiring. There's a southern tenacity that is palpable.\u00a0\nWe need many more allies showing up and speaking up though. We didn't create this situation and we can't fix it alone. Don't let the work\u00a0be only ours to carry, ok?\nThe significance of Pride and Juneteenth in the same month is not lost on me. Both are about liberation. LGBTQ+ folks wouldn't have the rights that we have without the Civil Rights Act. Pride was started by trans women of color such as Marsha P. Johnson, Sylvia Rivera, Miss Major Griffin-Gracy, and Storm\n\u00e9\n\u00a0DeLarverie. We can't lose sight that the most vulnerable among us fought - and still fight - the hardest.\nWhat we say and do personally shows up in the work we do professionally\u00a0\nI also visited the Nashville Juneteenth Festival. As a white person, I was a guest. I think it's important for\u00a0people like me and those who look like me\u00a0to learn about and have the experience of being a guest of other communities when we're allowed and invited (and not centered). \nWhen invited, Christians going to other faith events, heterosexual folks going to Pride, white folks at Juneteenth, and men going to women's conferences are all instrumental opportunities to appreciate the joy, authenticity, and beauty of communities we aren't a part of. Be a guest and listen. It's all right there if we're paying attention.\u00a0\nThese opportunities inform how we communicate cultural moments and movements, the stories we tell, and the lens through which we see and experience the world and its people.\u00a0\nGood work is happening...and there's more work to do\nThank you to the several clients who brought me in for sessions: \nWomen in Defense San Diego\nInstitute for Food Technologists\nSims Ltd.\u00a0\nIrdeto\u00a0\niDEIntity #changemakers\nIABC Philadelphia\nIABC (International Association of Business Communications) gave me space at World Conference\u00a0\nIMCA (Insurance Marketing Communications Association) gave me the main stage\nThank you for the space to have productive, tough, and real conversations, and for prioritizing this conversation for your members and employees.\u00a0\nI had the honor to meet hundreds of people from all over the world this month. People shared with me the fear they feel for their trans kid - I invite any leader who is stalling on DEI efforts to tell this mom that DEI isn't a priority amongst \"competing priorities\".\u00a0\nFriends, there's nothing fluffy or \"soft\" about DEI. It's about real lives, real people, real impact.\u00a0\nI listened to stories of frustration with leaders and stakeholders not taking meaningful action, and people looking to leave because of organizational inaction.\nOne point I made during one of my talks was that organizations choosing inertia as their DEI strategy may think they aren't causing any harm...but that's not at all true.\u00a0\nInaction is causing a lot of harm. I'll write more about that another time but know that there are options. We don't have to keep stuck in this. There's a tremendous world waiting on the other side of our yes.\u00a0\nWrite a post it for your monitor: \"Kim is not gay just in June\"\nThis is the last week of Pride Month 2023 in the U.S. Remember the last C of the 3Cs of Cultural Moments: Consistency. Stay on it and don't let up. \nSo, how do you feel about your participation this year? How has your organization protected and liberated LGBTQ+, Black, and African American\u00a0communities this month?

    "body": "Expert insights on making work more meaningful and keeping people engaged and motivated.\n \n \n\u00a0\nHi Hannah,\n\u00a0\nWhenever employees are surveyed about their jobs\u2014whether by market researchers or by job sites like Monster and Glassdoor for their annual trend reports\u2014there\u2019s one factor that always features prominently: meaningful work.\n\u00a0 \nIndeed, a 2021 report by global management consulting firm McKinsey & Company said that, over the past 30 years, \u201cAmericans have identified meaningful work as the most important aspect of a job\u2014ahead of income, job security, and the number of hours worked.\u201d\n\u00a0 \nThe same report also noted that, when employees find their work to be meaningful, their performance improves by 33%, they are 75% more committed to their organization, and are 49% less likely to leave.\n\u00a0 \nWhat\u2019s more, they found that a whopping 70% of people derive their sense of purpose solely from their work.\n\u00a0 \nAnd yet, despite this, only 50% of employees find meaning in their work today.\n\u00a0 \nTo put it another way, one out of every two employees is just treading water, doing a job that they are neither particularly engaged in nor motivated by, and simply going through the motions until something better comes along.\n\u00a0 \nThis, of course, is a situation that no company, no matter how large or small, wants to find itself in.\n\u00a0 \nBut how can this all-too-common predicament be avoided?\n\u00a0 \nWhat is it exactly that makes work meaningful for most people?\n\u00a0 \nAnd how can companies even begin to understand what specifically makes work meaningful for each of the the dozens, or hundreds, or thousands of people in their organization?\n\u00a0 \nFor the answers to these questions, and the opportunity to ask your own, join our live webinar with \nKatie Bailey\n, Professor of Work and Employment at King\u2019s Business School, King\u2019s College London and co-editor of \u2018The Oxford Handbook of Meaningful Work\u2019, and \nBlake Allan\n, Associate Professor and Program Director of Counseling Psychology at the University of Houston, which takes place \nTOMORROW (Thursday June 29) at 10am Central Time\n.

    "body": "What steps are you taking to support the LGBTQ+ community and ensure that every individual is respected and protected, year-round?\n \nHi Hannah,\n\u00a0\nIntent vs. impact is one of my favorite concepts when it comes to our DEI journeys. It\u2019s so difficult to get right, and requires ongoing investigation, calibration and adjustment.\u00a0\n\u00a0\nFor organizations, applying intent vs. impact means digging in to better understand if our strategies and efforts are hitting the mark - not in our estimation, but in the estimation of others. What might have worked well in the past may no longer work, or be enough, given the shifting landscape. If (when, inevitably) we discover gaps, we then create psychologically safe interactions and forums to follow up and determine what needs to change. We at JBC do this with every workplace community struggling to belong and thrive.\u00a0\n\u00a0\nSo what does true support - dictated \nby\n the community - look like? How have you incorporated this into your strategy? And how are you doing, throughout the year?\u00a0\nIf we\u2019ve learned one thing from the last few years, it\u2019s that specific \u201ccelebration\u201d days and months are not enough, but that sustained support and advocacy need to happen, 365 days a year.\u00a0\n\u00a0\nTo explore this, we at Jennifer Brown Consulting are launching \nLGBTQ+ listening sessions\n. Created to identify the specific sentiments and challenges facing LGBTQ+ employees, the Listening Sessions will support organizations who want to ensure that their policies, practices, and procedures support the changing needs of the LGBTQ+ community beyond Pride.\n\u00a0\nThe listening sessions will include:\nSafe conversations with a senior consultant to understand the current state\nAn executive report of key findings from the listening sessions with recommendations\nA debrief session with a senior consultant to align on incorporating recommendations into your DEI strategy\u00a0\nOne month a year is not enough. A continuous commitment to LGBTQ+ employees is an essential part of a DEI strategy where we create equitable cultures where everyone thrives. To learn how you can create lasting change with our listening sessions, inquire below and mention the LGBTQ+ listening sessions.\nInquire Here\n \nDon't Miss My LinkedIn Live with Dr. Elijah Nicholas Tomorrow at 12:30PM ET!\n\u00a0\nLast week, Elon Musk tweeted that the words 'cis' or 'cisgender' are now considered slurs on twitter. Please join me in conversation with Award-Winning Transgender Advocate Dr. Elijah Nicholas, as we discuss what this means for the transgender community, the importance of understanding and using gender inclusive language, and why LGBTQ+ allies are needed now more than ever. RSVP to the event on LinkedIn so you don't miss it!\n\u00a0\nSave My Seat\n \nWarmest Regards,\n\u00a0\nJennifer Brown\nCEO & Founder,\u00a0\nJennifer Brown Consulting\nAuthor,\u00a0\nInclusion\n,\u00a0\nHow to Be an Inclusive Leader\n, and\u00a0\nBeyond Diversity\nHost,\u00a0\nThe Will To Change\n\u00a0Podcast\n\u00a0\nFollow me on \nLinkedIn\n,\u00a0\nTwitter\n,\u00a0\nInstagram\n, and\u00a0\nFacebook\nConnect with Us\n \n \n \n \nJennifer Brown Consulting, 20 E 9th Street, Suite 4U, New York, NY 10003 \nUnsubscribe\n \nManage preferences",

From the questions \nwe ask your people, to the resources that get uploaded.\nIf you have a policy you want everyone to read then we can add that in there.\nGot a specific question you want your managers to answer? \nLet\u2019s get that in there too!\nOur modules have:\n\ud83d\udd79 professionally recorded videos\n\ud83d\udd79 signposting to other resources and readings such as web links, books, podcasts, films etc depending on the subject\n\ud83d\udd79 reflection activities\n\ud83d\udd79 internal group discussion activities\n\ud83d\udd79 quizzes\n\ud83d\udd79 downloadable\u00a0pdf resources for employees and managers\nAnd it\u2019s better to start with these two modules; \nto develop some foundational understanding at your organisation, \nthan to go straight into talking about more sensitive subjects such as racism, ageism, homophobia and more\u2026 that your people might not be prepped for.\n! WE HAVE AN OFFER FOR YOU !\nIf you purchase one or both of these courses before 4pm on 30th June there is a \n5% early-bird discount available!\nSo let\u2019s get EDI rolling at your company and hopefully you\u2019ll do a much better job of avoiding some \nvery tricky situations\n.\nTo find out more about the courses and to watch a short taster video,\nvisit the launch page\n.\nBut if you\u2019d rather fast-track talking to me about the courses then \nbook a call right away\n.\nThanks so much,\nHeeral\nCopyright (C) 2023 Convergent Consulting and Associates Limited.

    "body": "Welcome to The Forum\u2019s June newsletter, the second of our Combining Forces\n(x)\n year!\u00a0\nHello Forum family, \nMy name is Joanne K. Reeck and I\u2019ll be serving as the Interim Executive Director of The Forum on Workplace Inclusion. I\u2019d like to take this opportunity to briefly introduce myself. I have worked in higher education for 20 years and have over 20 years of facilitation experience. \nHere's my official bio.\nOffline, I can often be found camping and hiking at state parks with my 11-year-old son, Mateo, and rescue dog, Nova. We also spend time with extended family in Northern Minnesota.\nWith the solstice and warm weather, it's officially summer in Minnesota. As this new season emerges, The Forum follows suit. We are now busy analyzing the recent 35th annual conference and gearing up for the next round of Forum learning and community building.\nThere is a lot packed into this newsletter, but first I want to acknowledge two sponsors: Piper Sandler is our newsletter sponsor. Their support makes this publication possible. Our other 365 sponsor is Colgate-Palmolive, underwriting accessibility for all the events throughout the year outside of the annual conference.\u00a0\nAnd now a bit about this quarter\u2019s newsletter features:\nOur feature writer, Jacey Mismash, profiles a local Minnesota artist \u2013 Nyttu Chongo \u2013 who performed on the Orchestra Hall stage during the opening celebration at the annual conference.\nCatherine Hurley, from the Forum staff, shares highlights from the Combining Forces\n(x) \nconference.\nOur video short features Yaro Fong-Olivares and Rebecca McDougal of Bentley University\u2019s Center for Women and Business. They will talk about intersectional gender equity in the workplace.\nI hope you enjoy this edition of The Forum newsletter!\nThanks for your involvement with The Forum.\n \nAt Piper Sandler, we believe \ndiverse, equitable and inclusive teams with unique backgrounds, skills, and experiences\n create an ideal environment in which our employees can thrive, personally and professionally, while contributing their \nunique and valuable perspectives\n to the firm.\nWe strive to \nenable bright, committed people to work in partnership within an inclusive environment that allows each person to achieve personal success and add value\n to our teams and communities. By living up to the values of our organization we support our employees, and benefit our clients, shareholders and our communities.\nInterested in joining the team?

Photo collage, quote salad and graphic art curation by Catherine Hurley, Director of Partnership and Engagement at The Forum on Workplace Inclusion.\nThe Forum's cathartic and celebratory 35th Annual Conference was a visual feast \u2014 much more fun as a show and tell. Please enjoy the photos, be inspired by the quotes, watch the three general sessions and apply the graphic concepts to your daily human interactions. If you attended the conference, remember you can revisit all of the presentations on-demand through the end of August.\n \nRead on...\n\u00a0\n\"When folks ask me about \nthe best gathering of #DEI practitioners and advocates\n, I always tell them it's The Forum on Workplace Inclusion in Minneapolis.\"\n\"\nThe vibe and aesthetics were amazing\n. Beautiful opener!\"\n\"I love this conference. It is the \nhighlight\n of my year.\"\n\"I attended to see if the hype was real and I planned use time at the conference to create content...but I just \ncouldn't break away from the conversations, community, the learning, the CONNECTIONS\n.\"\n\"I feel a \nrenewed energy of motivation\n and purpose.\"\n\"After spending a couple of days at The Forum on Workplace Inclusion, it was great to see \nso many professionals who continue working every day to make workplaces and communities better for all\n.\"\n\"I am honored. \nGrateful.

    "body": "\ud83e\udd20SURJ strategy, part four\nThis is the fourth installment in a series of emails about SURJ\u2019s three year strategy to block authoritarianism from spreading and build the white flank of the multiracial majority. You can view the whole series \non our website\n.\n\u200a\nDear Hannah,\n\u00a0\nThe news about queer people these days is mostly horrifying and heartbreaking, so we\u2019re proud to share a bit of queer joy and resilience as we come to the end of pride month.\u00a0\n\u00a0\nThis past week, members of the Kentucky People\u2019s Union, a project of SURJ located in a small town in Eastern Kentucky, in partnership with Ashland Pride \norganized over 60 trans students, their parents, educators, and allies (pictured above) to demand that the local school board vote to not comply with SB 150\n, one of the worst anti-trans bills in the country, which includes a ban on gender-affirming care for trans youth and requires school districts to create policies that ban children from using bathrooms that align with their genders.\n \n\u00a0\nThe Kentucky People\u2019s Union is bringing together trans youth, working people, and community members who are ready to fight for all Kentuckians\u2019 rights and dignity. \nWill you give a gift today to help KPU grow its work?\n\u00a0\nThen, will you give a gift to support Ashland Pride, a key partner in KPU\u2019s organizing?\nAs you probably know, SURJ has deep roots in Kentucky. Some of our founders are from Kentucky and we have been investing in this majority-white, rural state for years.\n It\u2019s a place where Mitch McConnell and the GOP have built an empire, but it\u2019s also a place full of working white people ready to come with us. \nWe\u2019ve seen this time and again in our campaigns\u2013 whether \ndefeating a statewide amendment to ban abortion\n or \nelecting a slate of progressive judges in Louisville\n who support ending cash bail. \nKentucky People\u2019s Union is a key part of SURJ\u2019s strategy to build grassroots power in small towns and rural places in the South to block far right radicalization and undermine their base of support\u2013 and a cornerstone of our work in Kentucky.\u00a0\nLearn more about KPU\n \nA year ago, KPU had its first meeting of about 12 people\u00a0 (pictured above). Since then, they have knocked on hundreds of doors in the community, helped lead the SURJ campaign that stopped the abortion ban, and rallied at the state capitol to help defend trans people\u2019s rights. A year after that first meeting, KPU\u2019s member meeting had over 50 people in attendance where they voted to launch a housing rights campaign (pictured below).\n\u200a\n\u200a\nRight now, KPU is building out this housing campaign, organizing the local school board to not comply with SB 150, and working alongside SURJ\u2019s national work to re-elect Democratic Governor Andy Beshear. As our work in Kentucky grows, we\u2019re hatching plans to expand SURJ\u2019s organizing across Appalachia.\u00a0\nKPU is an example of what we know at SURJ: that there are millions of working white people waiting for us to talk to them and waiting to be invited in.\u00a0\nWill you give a gift today to grow this work in Appalachia and beyond?\nIn solidarity,\u00a0 \nSURJ and the Kentucky People\u2019s Union\nI'd like to give!\n \n\u00a0\nShowing Up for Racial Justice\nPO Box 1376\nBuffalo, NY 14205\nUnited States\nIf you believe you received this message in error or wish to no longer receive email from us, please \nunsubscribe\n.",

Increasingly we participate in conversations about \u201cbelonging\u201d in multiple sectors and with several lenses. What does it mean to have a \u2018sense of belonging\u2019 when your entire life has been shaped by global mobility and different cultures? Third Culture Kids (TCKs) deal with issues of belonging because they have spent a significant part of their upbringing crossing cultures. Their experiences can make it challenging to find, form, and sustain a sense of belonging. In this webinar, Megan leads the discussion about what it means to belong in multiple communities: personal, professional, familial, cultural, and spiritual. Megan invites participants to ponder how to belong, where to belong, and why to belong.\u00a0\n\u00a0\nRegistration = FREE for current SIETAR USA members in good standing\n\u00a0\nRegistration = $25.00 for nonmembers\n \n \n \n \n \n \nMember-Register \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nNon-Member-Register \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nAbout Your Presenter\nMegan Norton\nMegan Norton is an author, Third Culture Kid (TCK) consultant, intercultural trainer, podcast host of \nA Culture Story\n, and writer at \nadultthirdculturekid.com\n.

    "body": "Cutting-edge insights from SaaStr Europa.\n \n\u00a0\nHi Hannah,\n\u00a0\nThe past few years have been a rip-roaring odyssey for Software-as-a-Service (SaaS) companies.\n\u00a0 \nDuring the pandemic, many rode the crest of a wave of hugely inflated valuations as their stock prices soared to record highs. Then, in 2022, came a sobering splash of cold water as global financial headwinds conspired to sink those deceptively bouyant valuations by an average of 50%\u2014and in some cases, much more\u2014while VC capital hoisted anchor and charted a course for sunnier climes.\n\u00a0 \nNow, as we head into the second half of 2023, while the waters may still be choppy for those sailing on the good ship SaaS, it seems that the worst of the storms are over, and a brave new world is starting to glimmer on the horizon.\n\u00a0 \nIt was fitting, then, that this year\u2019s SaaStr Europa event should be held at the historic Tobacco Dock in London, with the world\u2019s largest community of SaaS executives, founders, and entrepreneurs coming together for two days of workshops, panel discussions, Q&As, and more just a stone\u2019s throw from the flowing waters of the Thames.\n\u00a0 \nFollowing on from our voyage to the inaugural SaaStr APAC in Singapore in February, Attuned was once again part of the armada of SaaS companies that descended on London, alongside heavyweight guests from the likes of Loom, UiPath and Cockroach Labs, as well as SaaStr\u2019s swashbuckling captain, Jason Lemkin.\n\u00a0 \nRead our report\u2014including why \u201cYour first 50 hires should be pirates and romantics\u201d\u2014here.\n\u00a0\nFree Webinar!\nHow can organizations make work more meaningful? That\u2019s the question we\u2019ll be exploring in our next free live webinar, which takes place on \nThursday June 29 at 10am Central Time\n. Science journalist Tania Rabesandratana will be joined by Katie Bailey, Professor of Work and Employment at King\u2019s Business School, King\u2019s College London, and Blake Allan, Associate Professor and Program Director of Counseling Psychology at the University of Houston, to craft a contemporary definition of meaningful work, and offer advice on how organizations can foster it to boost engagement, motivation and performance. \nSign up in seconds here.\n\u00a0\nHave a motivating day!\n\u00a0\nCasey\nCasey Wahl\nFounder & CEO\nP.S. Attuned transforms communication and turbo-charges motivation. Want to know how it can benefit your business?\n \nLet's talk.\n\u00a0\nP.P.S. Want even more in-depth insights?

If this is happening in your workplace, I want to share a few resources with you.\n\u00a0\nOn\u00a0\nTuesday, May 30 at 12pm\n, we are going to be hosting a webinar called \u201cAsk an Expert Anything: Responding to Resistance to DEI,\u201d facilitated by Executive Coach and Master Facilitator Jeffrey Cookson, GPHR, SPHR. This forum will be safe space to explore ways to overcome resistance in the workplace and will help you to identity specific language to use and avoid when resistance surfaces.\n\u00a0\nIn addition, we know that 2023 is halfway over, but there is still time to make impact. \nRight now, LCW is offering a 30% discount on any new statement of work signed by June 30, 2023.\n If there is anything that you need or any program that you're curious about, let me know.

    "subject": "From Day One: Where Recruiters Roam When Hiring Slows",
    "body": "They were HR heroes during the Great Resignation, when employers were desperate to fill millions of jobs. Recruiters helped make possible the hiring surge of 2022, when U.S. employers\n hired a record 76 million people\n. But then the tide turned. Now it\u2019s the recruiters who are getting pink slips, some of them before the workers they brought on. \u201cThe demand for recruiters has dropped at three times the rate of overall hiring demand,\u201d according to data from \nLinkedIn\n.\n\u00a0\nWe've secured an exclusive opportunity for our members to take part \nin AARP's Employee Caregiver Program Series!\nThis series, free of charge for From Day One subscribers, is an easy way to make your workplace more caregiver-inclusive via live virtual programs on a range of challenges that working family caregivers face at home and work.\nTo learn more and reserve a spot, visit\u00a0\ncaregiving.fromdayone.co\n\u00a0\nWhat happens to these professionals when the market for their job description crashes? Many leaders are finding creative ways to keep recruiters on staff even with little or no hiring to do. In the process, they\u2019re reinforcing the business value of talent acquisition and recognizing the mix of people skills that comes with the role of selling a company as a great place to work. \u201cWe saw it as an opportunity to repurpose our skills,\u201d Selin Molinari, director of talent acquisition at the business-and-tech consulting firm Slalom, told From Day One contributing editor Emily McCrary-Ruiz-Esparza.\n\u00a0\nRecruiters on Tour to Learn New Skills\n\u00a0\nLast October, Slalom created a \u201ctour\u201d program, sending recruiters on temporary assignments to teams like sales or marketing. A recruiter might be \u201con tour\u201d full-time for three months or six months, or they might be working on marketing projects for 20 hours per week and building the talent pipeline for the other 20. Of Slalom\u2019s 400 recruiters, a quarter are currently on tour.\u00a0\n\u00a0\nTouring recruiters get a chance at career development\u2014especially appealing for early career workers. For recruiters who crave experience and exposure, tours are a powerful means of retention. Given the pace of skill obsolescence, \nworkers are willing to change jobs for career development opportunities\n, and employers need low-cost ways to upskill. Internal mobility is beneficial at a time when it\u2019s become hard to attract and retain all kinds of workers, but \nespecially in HR, where burnout is high\n.\n\u00a0\nAs hiring has slowed, internal mobility is increasing, according to LinkedIn\u2019s \nMay 2023 Global Talent Trends Report\n. \u201cCelebrating lateral movement also addresses one of the risks associated with mobility\u2014hitting a glass ceiling,\u201d writes Kevin Oakes in \nHarvard Business Review\n.\u00a0\n\u00a0\nSlalom\u2019s program also prevents HR leaders from having to shut down recruiting operations, avoiding a cumbersome reboot when hiring resumes. Some recruiters on tour still devote time to filling the pipeline with leads, and Slalom created a team to manage the tours, so when hiring picks up again, the TA team knows where to find its recruiters.\n\u00a0\nTemporarily reassigning recruiters lifts them out of the usual cycle of hiring surges and layoffs, giving talent acquisition the chance to demonstrate its versatility. Recruiters not only have soft skills like communication and relationship-building\u2014talent-sourcers today are also data analysts, \nemployer brand marketers\n, and strategic, long-term thinkers. As HR\u2019s influence permeates every corner of a business, its members are becoming highly developed all-rounders.\u00a0\n\u00a0\nRobyn Thornton, director of talent acquisition at recruiting tech company SeekOut, considers relocating recruiters to other teams an investment in their long-term success and a natural fit for a department whose skills have become so extensive. This strategy can also bolster long-term job security for the team. \u201cIf you\u2019re not hiring, they think that, \u2018Oh, that\u2019s an easy place to have some cuts,\u2019\u201d said Thornton. Deploying them business-wide dispels that myth.\n\u00a0\nWhile hiring is slow at SeekOut, Katelyn Harris Lange, a senior talent sourcer, has been working on content marketing, sales, and LinkedIn strategy. When she returns to TA full-time, she\u2019ll be a more qualified recruiter. \u201cIt always helps to know so I can speak very authentically about the culture of the company and the identity of a very specific team, how they work together and very specific initiatives,\u201d she said.\u00a0\n\u00a0\nIt\u2019s also giving Harris Lange a reason to stick around. \u201cThroughout my career, I\u2019ve been looking for a place to land where I can expand, where I\u2019m not siloed, where I can use my strengths in different areas, and I feel this is the first place I\u2019ve really been able to do that,\u201d she said.\n\u00a0\nNot All Recruiters Get to Stay in One Shop\n\u00a0\nStill, plenty of recruiters are being let go. Especially at companies that specialize in talent acquisition, layoffs have been sharp. ZipRecruiter, the job posting site, said last month\n it will eliminate about 20% of its workforce\n, or about 270 roles.\u00a0\n\u00a0\nOne recruiter, who asked that her name not be used, told From Day One she was laid off from a major tech company in December. \u201cBy November, we knew there was no work,\u201d she said. Having seen plenty of job-market surges come and go, this recruiter is considering whether to switch careers rather than wait out another business cycle. \u201cI feel like recruitment has maybe run its course for me,\u201d she said. \u201cIt might just be time for something fresh and new.\u201d Her next stop might be tech sales, where she\u2019s looking for roles now.\n\u00a0\nTransitions to new roles could be easier thanks to the growing reputation of \nHR as a core business function\n. Diversity, equity, and inclusion leaders have \njoined the C-suite\n, \nHR analytics leaders\n are leading business meetings, and students are seeing \nHR as an onramp to a career as an executive or business owner\n. Over half of recruiters who have left the position in the last year have taken other roles in the HR function, but the other half have changed careers, taking roles in sales and business development, operations, or IT, according to \nLinkedIn data\n.\n\u00a0\nHighly publicized layoffs in big tech can slant perception of the job market. In the long term, the U.S. economy is\n facing a labor shortage\n because the workforce is aging; even in the short term, some industries are desperately seeking workers. \nLinkedIn\u2019s chief economist Karin Kimbrough told \nInc.\n in May that the hiring-hungry industries of health care, hospitality, oil and gas, and manufacturing are \u201cbright spots\u201d in the labor market. The economist also noted that workers are investing in themselves. \u201cIf you have skills that are in demand, you have currency to maneuver through the job market,\u201d Kimbrough said.\n\u00a0\nTalent acquisition leaders like Molinari and Thornton believe HR needn\u2019t surrender such versatile employees to other fields, and redeploying recruiters across the business may change the perception that TA is a one-note team. \u201cRecruiters are pretty versatile. We have to learn about various jobs,\u201d said Thornton. \u201cThat\u2019s the fun part of the business.\u201d \nRead the full story here\n.\n\u00a0 \nWEBINAR RECAP\n\u00a0 \nThe Other Caregiving Crisis: How Employers Can Help Workers With Their Hidden Responsibilities:\u00a0\nWhile the pandemic revealed a crisis in childcare, it also exposed a crisis in family caregiving for adults. One in five workers has responsibility for the care of one or more adults who are aging, ill, or have special needs, according to research by\n AARP\n. Yet more than half of these caregivers don\u2019t tell their supervisors about it. Fortunately, that situation is changing. In a recent survey of 200 leaders in HR conducted by From Day One with support from AARP, 56% of the respondents said that workers are increasingly open with colleagues and managers about caregiving responsibilities, while 60% said that their companies associate support for family caregivers with improving morale and belonging. \u201cBefore the pandemic, convincing employers to prioritize their support of working caregivers was an uphill battle,\u201d said Tricia Sandiego, a senior advisor at AARP, in a\n From Day One webinar\n on the issue. But from the survey results, \u201cwe learned that there is an increase in awareness. Workers are talking about caregiving, and company leaders do realize and acknowledge that it\u2019s important.\u201d That said, there is still room for improvement: fewer than 15% of respondents said supporting family caregivers was a major priority at their companies. \nRead the full story here\n.\u00a0\n\u00a0 \nLIVE CONFERENCE HIGHLIGHTS\n\u00a0 \nRetaining and Motivating Employees by Showing Them Their Work Matters: \nMotivating employees goes hand in hand with keeping them. And neither task is easy. A five-person panel recently went through the ups and downs of that process in a discussion titled \u201cRetaining and Motivating Employees by Showing Them Their Work Matters\u201d at\n From Day One's Minneapolis conference\n. It can be tricky to zero in on the intangible sense among employees that their work has meaning. Part of that equation has to do with having employees buy into your company\u2019s mission, according to Laura Lorenz, VP of HR for\n 3M\n. \u201cThe focus is aspirational,\u201d Lorenz said. \u201cWe\u2019re the world\u2019s largest provider of N95 masks, and during Covid we kept our prices the same. That was a source of pride for our people.\u201d \nRead the full story here\n.\u00a0\n\u00a0\nCan We Eradicate Unintentional Bias and Discrimination? Well, We Can Begin: \nHuman judgment\u2014and the unconscious biases that it can give rise to\u2014will always be with us. That\u2019s why Jessica Nordell\u2019s acclaimed book\n \nThe End of Bias\n comes with the subtitle, \u201cA Beginning.\u201d One approach that can help reduce discrimination, Nordell found, is to use objective criteria in making decisions, assessments, and promotions. \u201cIt\u2019s not so much about changing hearts and minds as it is about changing the decision-making environment,\u201d said Nordell, an award-winning author and science writer. In assessing the results of anti-bias and anti-discrimination interventions, Nordell focuses on examining data and looking for measurable change, she said at the \nMinneapolis conference\n. \nRead the full story here\n.\u00a0\n\u00a0\nHow Well-Being Is a Key Ingredient in Healthy Work Lives and Company Success: \n\u201cIt\u2019s a normal part of our company culture to engage with our system of well-being,\u201d said Dr. Jeff Tzeng, the SVP of health and well-being at\n AT&T\n, in a fireside chat at\n From Day One\u2019s Dallas conference\n. AT&T is focusing on this culture of well-being because they want to increase productivity and make it a better company, said Dr. Jeff, as his colleagues call him. Interviewed by Shelly Hagan, economic development and government reporter at \nBloomberg\n, the doctor shed light on their renewed focus on well-being and the path to a more holistic approach. With a growing recognition of the importance of mental health in the workplace, he said, AT&T has made significant strides to enhance its offerings and support systems. \nRead the full story here\n.\u00a0\n\u00a0\nAfter Three Years of Crisis, What Will Keep Employees Engaged and Motivated? \nOver the past three years, workers have had to learn how to adapt and build new skills in order to succeed in a constantly changing work environment. In the aftermath of the pandemic, this same workforce is now experiencing extensive burnout. Now organizations are tasked with finding ways to help their employees get past survival mode, through means of building an inclusive culture that supports a sense of employee engagement. During a panel discussion at \nFrom Day One\u2019s Brooklyn conference\n, moderated by Lydia Dishman of \nFast Company\n, a group of panelists offered their perspective on how their business is renewing a sense of meaning among its employees. \nRead the full story here\n.\u00a0\u00a0\n\u00a0 \nVIRTUAL EVENTS HIGHLIGHTS\n\u00a0 \nProviding Learning and Growth Opportunities for Employees, Even in Austere Times: \nFinding low-cost learning opportunities can be the difference between keeping an employee and losing them. According to an\n international poll by McKinsey\n, 41% of workers who quit their jobs in recent years did so because of a lack of career development opportunities, the most commonly cited reason for moving on. \u201cIt\u2019s important that we\u2019re retaining our employees because we need that knowledge internally,\u201d said Nicole Underwood, VP of HR business partners at \nGetty Images\n. During\n From Day One\u2019s May virtual conference\n, Underwood and four other leaders discussed how to provide career development opportunities for employees even in austere times. \nRead the full story here\n.\u00a0\n\u00a0\nUnlocking Our Full Potential: Breaking Free from Limiting Habits and Jobs: \nEven the most accomplished individuals in their field deal with the feeling of being stuck. Adam Alter, author of \nAnatomy of a Breakthrough: How to Get Unstuck\n \nWhen It Matters Most\n, relays that Lionel Messi, perhaps the greatest living soccer player, is famously anxious. When he was starting out, coaches noted that, while physically and athletically accomplished, he lacked the temperament to be a champion. Messi subsequently had to learn to quell his anxiety, and his solution might seem paradoxical. \u201cHe learned to start the game by not playing for the first few minutes,\u201d Alter told journalist Lila Seidman of the \nLos Angeles Times\n during the\n May virtual conference\n. \u201cHe spends the first two to three minutes just ambling around. If you plot the path, everybody is darting around. Messi is barely moving. It quells his anxiety, but he\u2019s also tactically beneficial, he\u2019s surveying the territory.\u201d \nRead the full story here\n.\u00a0\nWith a Bumper Crop of New Options, Benefits Leaders Need to Make Smart Choices:\n It\u2019s no secret that employees expect more from employers than they did five years ago. Companies have offered innovative solutions from pet care to travel-as-a-benefit to meet the demand. But companies only have so many resources, especially nowadays, as the economy begins to decline. \u201cMany of us are thinking about coming out of this couple of years of such an intensive talent and labor market, where a lot of companies have been under pressure to offer more and more,\u201d said Joanna Daly, VP of total rewards at\n IBM\n. \u201cSo I do think we're at an inflection point.\u201d As a result, employers have to make choices about what benefits are the most valuable to employees and prospective hires. Daly spoke with moderator Bryan Walsh, editor for Future Project at\n Vox Media\n, at\n From Day One\u2019s virtual April conference\n, \u201cCreative Total Rewards to Set Employers Apart,\u201d during a fireside chat session. \nRead the full story here\n.\n\u00a0 \nQUICK HITS\n\u00a0 \nCompanies Quiet Their Diversity and Sustainability Talk Amid Culture War Boycotts: \nThe Wall Street Journal \nreports that companies\u2019 mentions of green and social initiatives during earnings calls have fallen off sharply in recent quarters, reversing a more boastful approach taken over the past few years amid intensifying pressure from some investors and conservative activists. Take electronic-signature firm \nDocuSign\n, where chief financial officer Cynthia Gaylor in March 2022 said the company achieved carbon-neutral status during the year ended that January. Gaylor, who is set to step down as CFO this month, at the time said the company was continuing its efforts to reach net-zero emissions no later than 2050. \nRead the full story here\n.\u00a0\n\u00a0\nHow Remote Work Connected Employees Making $19 an Hour and $80,000 a Year: \nEric Deshawn Lerma felt waves of anxiety when he sat down to tally the new costs in his routine since Amazon\u2019s return to the office this spring. There\u2019s parking. There\u2019s fuel. There\u2019s lunch. They add up to at least $200 extra a month, all to support a policy whose justification he can\u2019t fully understand\u2014after three years in which he and his teammates have been doing their jobs from home. In this context, according to \nThe New York Times\n, large crowds of workers walked off the job at Amazon\u2019s Seattle headquarters last month for one hour during lunchtime. They were protesting the company\u2019s return-to-office rule, among other issues including layoffs and the company\u2019s impact on the climate, and carried signs with slogans like \u201cJust Say No to RTO.\u201d Weeks earlier, employees voiced their frustrations with the return-to-office policy in a Remote Advocacy channel, with over 30,000 members, on the Slack workplace messaging system. \nRead the full story here\n.\u00a0\n\u00a0\nRevenge Served Ice Cold:\n Last month, Lewis Brisbois Bisgaard & Smith, one of the nation\u2019s largest law firms, was rocked by the announcement that two top partners were starting their own boutique practice and taking as many as 140 colleagues with them. The shock inside Lewis Brisbois\u2019 downtown Los Angeles headquarters soon gave way to anger as the recently departed partners embarked on a press campaign that portrayed their former employer as a profit-focused legal mill. In an extraordinary move, as detailed in the Los Angeles Times, its management team directed the release of scores of emails in which Barber and Ranen used vile terms and offensive stereotypes. Their former employer had received an anonymous complaint about the former partners, which recommended the firm scrutinize the emails of both men. In a statement, the firm said it was\u00a0 \u201cshocked to find dozens of emails \u2026 with unacceptable, prejudiced language aimed at our colleagues, clients, attorneys from other firms, and even judges.\u201d \nRead the full story here\n.\u00a0\n\u00a0 \nSPONSOR SPOTLIGHTS\n\u00a0 \nCLAIRA\n\u00a0\nSearching for Competency: How AI Can Make Management More Inclusive\u2013and Effective: \nWhile much of the conversation about artificial intelligence has focused on the frightening ways AI could disrupt social institutions\u2014\nor much worse\n\u2014what\u2019s often overlooked is how much businesses are already using it. In a survey, 42% of HR professionals at companies with more than 5,000 workers said they use AI and other automation to support HR activities,\n according to a 2022 poll\n of HR leaders by the Society of Human Resource Management (SHRM). The top areas for using AI: recruiting and hiring, learning and development, and performance management. Even so, more than half of the AI-using professionals said they have run into challenges, including AI accidentally overlooking or excluding qualified candidates. How can companies use AI in ways that are both more inclusive and effective? They could focus much less on credentials and more on skills and aptitude. \u201cWe think competencies level the playing field,\u201d said Katie Hall, CEO and founder of\n Claira\n, a workforce-management platform powered by AI that measures workers\u2019 competencies to improve hiring, engagement and employee retention. \u201cEveryone everywhere has competencies. We think that the system has to change and be set up in such a way that we don\u2019t make permanent mistakes with the AI revolution that\u2019s coming.\u201d \nRead the full story here\n.\n\u00a0\nSTORK CLUB\n\u00a0\nHolistic Wellness for Women: Supporting Health in Every Life Phase:\n\u00a0It began with a goal to increase the number of women in their workforce. The plan was to create a suite of benefits that appeal to women, starting with maternity health coverage. \u201cAs we heard from our employee resource groups, that\u2019s something that was valuable to them,\u201d said Amy Rennock, chief HR officer at \nJamf Software\n, which builds Apple device management technology. Ultimately, the company\u2019s search for an inclusive, family-building health plan changed the way Jamf thinks about providing health care. \u201cWe have a lot of men who have families that are served by this benefit. We have a lot of trans employees who are getting services and feeling supported.\u201d Rennock told Jamf\u2019s story during a recent \nFrom Day One webinar\n, alongside Liz Pittinger, head of global customer success at \nStork Club\n, Jamf\u2019s family-building benefits partner. \nRead the full story here\n.\nAVENICA\n\u00a0\nEmbracing a New Era of Talent Assessment: \nLeonardo da Vinci gets credit for inventing, among other things, the parachute, the armored car and the resume. Some 500-plus years later, employers still use the resume to assess job seekers\u2019 potential. That\u2019s a problem, accelerated today with resume-scanning algorithms that can introduce biases and exclude many aspiring job candidates. \u201cResumes don\u2019t predict a damn thing,\u201d Scott Dettman, CEO of\n Avenica\n, said during a presentation at \nFrom Day One\u2019s conference in Minneapolis\n. Dettman should know. He helped prove that resumes have no predictive value while working at ManpowerGroup. A massive study there, done with Google and Cognizant, concluded that resumes cannot forecast how a job applicant will perform. Or even whether someone will get hired. \nRead the full story here\n.\u00a0\nACCOLADE\nEmpower Your Workforce With Health Navigators, Guiding Employees Through Pivotal Moments: \nMore than a quarter of all health care dollars are wasted due to failed care delivery, lack of care coordination, or unnecessary treatment. It\u2019s an astounding percentage, exacerbated by rising health care costs. Given corporate focus on cost containment, it is an issue that companies need to address. The wasted money is a symptom of a larger problem, though: how to provide health care solutions to employees that are attractive, useful, and cost effective. In a\n From Day One webinar\n, two executives from the health navigation company\n Accolade\n talked about how this kind of service can help achieve cost containment, better outcomes, and stellar appreciation from users. \nRead the full story here\n.\u00a0\n\u00a0 \n\u00a0 \nUPCOMING EVENTS\n\u00a0 \nWEBINARS\n\u00a0\nGet credit!

Over the decades, approaches have been modernized and companies are implementing more holistic employee listening strategies. This has become a critical shift as the workplace has changed and modernized in the past few years, and this session will share combined experiences and learnings from hundreds of organizations that have upgraded their approach to employee listening. \nRegister now\n.\n\u00a0\nJune 29: Attracting Non-Traditional and Diverse Talent.\u00a0 \nEvery company is a tech company.

Applicants use them to apply to multiple jobs at once\u2014rather than to find the job they\u2019re really excited about. To increase your chances of hiring hourly workers who are more likely to stick around, you need to implement a diverse, active sourcing strategy. Join industry expert Jackie Adams to learn the top strategies businesses can employ to increase applicant quality and build a stronger hourly workforce. \nRegister now\n.\u00a0\n\u00a0\nAug. 3: How the Definition of Total Rewards Is Changing. \nThe broadening scope of rewards is helping employers respond to more diverse needs, as well as giving employers the ability to focus on rewards that provide the biggest impact. What are the newest and most effective rewards, ranging from relocation programs and scholarships to management development and employee recognition? How can companies evaluate these diverse programs in a way that has emotional impact but represent efficient business practices? \nRegister now\n.\n\u00a0\nOct. 10: Why Women\u2019s Health Benefits Are Essential to Retention. \nWomen\u2019s health can be a high cost driver for employers. Additionally, offering solutions to improve and support needs specific to women can also be an important factor to retention. But women\u2019s health in general is not just one condition. Join us for this fireside chat in which Dr. Leslie Saltzman, Ovia Health\u2019s chief medical officer, explains the different facets of women\u2019s health (like menopause, fertility, and maternity care management), what areas generate the most ROI, and how employers can offer the deepest, and most all-encompassing benefits to support and delight their employees and medically supported dependents. \nRegister now\n.\u00a0\n\u00a0\nNov. 9: How Tech Can Boost Engagement and Recognition.\n In a distributed workforce, how can employers promote both team cohesion and making individual employees feel \"seen\" by their managers and peers? What have business leaders learned in the past two years about which technologies and practices are motivational and informative, vs. fatiguing or counterproductive? \nRegister now\n.\u00a0\n\u00a0\nLIVE EVENTS\n\u00a0\nJoin us in the real world!

How can companies accentuate the benefits of sticking with\u00a0 their organizations, emphasizing factors including personal growth, fulfillment, and benefits tailored to their individual needs? Which tools can accurately measure employee satisfaction, and how can managers augment their effect? \nRegister here to attend\n.\u00a0\n\u00a0\nAug. 9: \nThe Changing Profile of HR Leaders: How the Role Is Evolving and Growing\n.\n In just the past two years, HR has risen to the C-suite level in influence and responsibility.

Yet health and well-being among employees goes beyond acute or specific physical or mental health needs. How can companies create a culture that emphasizes health through everyday experience? What are the hidden opportunities to nurture this kind of culture? Rather than relying only on standard\u00a0 benefits to respond in times of unexpected distress, how can organizations address employee needs proactively? \nRegister here to attend\n.\u00a0\n\u00a0\nSept. 27: \nGiving Workers Direction About Skills and Career Development\n. \nMany workers yearn to grow and advance in their careers, yet don\u2019t have an understanding of how to develop their skills and experience\u00a0 for a role with more responsibility. Learning and\u00a0 development can help not only by showing the many possibilities, but also with vision to help employees find the learning and development path that will enable the most fulfilling growth according to their own interests. What can organizations do to deploy coaching in a way that helps not only with short-term goals but also the long arc of a worker\u2019s career? \nRegister here to attend\n.\u00a0\n\u00a0\nOct. 11: \nHow HR Technology Can Connect, Motivate, and Recognize the Hybrid Workforce\n. \nMost workers have strongly embraced hybrid and remote work arrangements, having settled into sustainable routines that allow them to be productive. But camaraderie and a sense of belonging have proven elusive without meaningful face-to-face contact and team-building opportunities. How can organizations create new structures for in-person gatherings that maintain the comfort of remote or hybrid work, as well as new digital approaches that create the ties that bind? \nRegister here to attend\n.\u00a0\n\u00a0\nNov. 8: \nCasting a Wider Net: Fresh, Productive Approaches to Diversity Recruiting\n. \nMany companies fall short of their diversity-hiring goals because they keep looking in the same places\u2013and with the same techniques and expectations. What are the best ways for employers to break out of these patterns?

However, recently, we're hearing that many of these DEI initiatives are stalling. If this is happening in your workplace, I want to share a few resources with you.\n\u00a0\nOn\u00a0\nTuesday, May 30 at 12pm\n, we are going to be hosting a webinar called \u201cAsk an Expert Anything: Responding to Resistance to DEI,\u201d facilitated by Executive Coach and Master Facilitator Jeffrey Cookson, GPHR, SPHR. This forum will be safe space to explore ways to overcome resistance in the workplace and will help you to identity specific language to use and avoid when resistance surfaces.\n\u00a0\nIn addition, we know that 2023 is halfway over, but there is still time to make impact. \nRight now, LCW is offering a 30% discount on any new statement of work signed by June 30, 2023.\n If there is anything that you need or any program that you're curious about, let me know. I'd be happy to help you.\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n------------------------------------------------------\nHannah Strack \u2013 she/her\nBusiness Development Associate \nEmail: \nh.strack@lcwmail.com\nPhone: +1 773-828-1202 [EST]\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\nwww\n\u00a0\n|\n\u00a0\nTwitter\n \n|\n\u00a0\nFacebook\n\u00a0\n|\n\u00a0\nLinkedIn\nTo inspire kindness, deepen\u00a0understanding, and foster equity in\u00a0the communities\u00a0where people live\u00a0and at the organizations where they\u00a0work.\n\u00a0\nFrom:\n Khadija Darugar <\nk.darugar@cue.me\n> \nSent:\n Friday, June 2, 2023 9:25 AM\nTo:\n Hannah Strack <\nh.strack@lcwmail.com\n>\nCc:\n Melissa Neu <\nm.neu@lcwmail.com\n>; \nb.peralta@cue.me\nSubject:\n Re: CUE Health + LCW Follow-Up\n\u00a0\nHi Hannah,\n\u00a0\nCould you please attach the email from Melissa?\n\u00a0\nThanks!\nKhadija\u00a0\n\u00a0\nOn Fri, Jun 2, 2023 at 7:18 AM Hannah Strack <\nh.strack@lcwmail.com\n> wrote:\nGood Morning Khadija, \n\u00a0\nThank you very much for the update!

Eligibility Code: \n\"SAVE29\"\nRegister Now\nDescription:-\nMany have noticed that their work-life boundaries have blurred, and they have not taken a real break since the start of the pandemic.\nIt is essential that we find the strategies to manage our energy, focus on happiness, and integrate all aspects of our life. But how do we do that when we are time-pressured, reactive, tired out, and running on empty? Failing to focus on taking a break and creating balance and life satisfaction can lead to burnout, mental health challenges, and a variety of physical health repercussions.\nExamine your personal Wheel of Life and discover how you allocate your energy. By applying simplicity strategies to the S-O-S Principle, you will be able to discover a renewed sense of balance, engagement, and health.\nAreas Covered:-\nKey messages:\nBalance does not mean equal\nBalance is continually changing\nBalance and life satisfaction are activities that you continually engage in as you make corrections throughout the day, week, and months ahead. Focus is on more of what you love and less of what you loathe\nAs we move through challenge and out of crisis mode and transition into the next phase of adjustments, focusing on balance and life satisfaction is a critical part of staying mentally fit\nSimplicity: Small shifts can make major impacts on how engaged and satisfied you are with your life\nYou owe it to yourself to make sure you are maintaining a healthy work-life balance that allows you to thrive, both personally and professionally\nParticipants will:\nDiscover the results that a lack of balance has and the way that it is impacting their productivity, health, and enjoyment and that of their teams\nIdentify the many areas of priority and importance in life. Examine the Wheel of Life model to map strategies for how we allocate our energy\nFocus on Simplicity. Small shifts can make major impacts on how engaged and satisfied you are with your life\nUnderstand and identify the many energy drainers and utilize energy boosters to free up mental and physical energy\nGain clarity, a sense of direction, and motivation to live life with contentment, calmness, and connection\nWhy You Should Attend:-\nResearch shows that this is a normal response when a crisis occurs, but as the pandemic wears on, it is important to regain the focus on living a full and flourishing life despite the circumstances.\nBalance can feel like an unrealistic dream. Balance is an activity that you must continually engage in as you make corrections and adjustments based on circumstances. Balance becomes the harmonious simplification and integration of all aspects of life, including coping with business disruption, working remotely, and other impacts of the pandemic.\nExamine your personal Wheel of Life and discover how you allocate your energy. By applying simplicity strategies to the S-O-S Principle, you will be able to discover a renewed sense of balance, engagement, and health during this current challenge and as you move forward.\nOr more than 6 attendee call us at \n+1-877-896-6748\u00a0\nor mail us at\u00a0\ncs@ineducator.com\nYou can choose to stop receiving updates from us \nUnsubscribe Here\nEmail By:- Ineducators \n7201 Wisconsin Ave Suite 440 Bethesda, MD 20814",
