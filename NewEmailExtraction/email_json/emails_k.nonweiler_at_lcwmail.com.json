I need your help please.\nThis is for a Sony training.\nThey set up the Zoom link for their April 17\nth\n\u00a0training & have given us the host key, which they say will let us in if no one from Sony is there. Well, both Yuko (the facilitator based in Japan) & I have both tried, and we can't get in. Below you will find the link & host key - you can try yourself. It just asks you to sign in as host, which isn't what we want. We want it to prompt us to enter the hoost key & let us in.\nThe client has turned on the setting to allow people to join the meeting at any time, but that didn't work.\nThey also said they updated their settings to \"allow Zoom room to start meeting with host key,\" but it's still not working.\nI know they should figure this out bc it's their Zoom, but i'm trying to help.\nAgain, you can test by using their Zoom link & host key:\nHOST KEY: 817545\u00a0\nhttps://spe-dct.zoom.us/j/95463155058?pwd=Saj6K9m55oadv8S7sj9K7tZ22VMxut.1\nLMK if you have any questions or need more info.\nHoping to get something - even if to say we can't figure it out - by next Wed if possible.\nThank you!\nFrom:\n Nicole Barile\nSent:\n Wednesday, April 2, 2025 9:36 PM\nTo:\n Kaitlin Nonweiler <k.nonweiler@lcwmail.com>\nSubject:\n zoom issue\n \n\u00a0\nHi.

It's difficult to know the specifics of the NEW process until I or someone else goes through the steps. \n@Andrea Wicks Bowles\n\u00a0maybe your client will be willing to be a guinea pig!\u00a0\nMain changes:\nTaking the assessment: participant/respondent no longer receives a login link, username and password to take the assessment, instead,\u00a0they receive an access code link to create an IDI account\nTracking: The IDI tracking spreadsheet currently has columns for username and password, and the respondent is tracked using the username in the old platform. With the NEW platform, I believe we can use the respondent's email for tracking (using guinea pig would help for this detail)\u00a0\nInviting respondent to create their IDI account: Use new platform to send emails or send emails manually? If sending an email manually, the invitation email will need to be updated with new process.\u00a0\nhttps://www.dropbox.com/scl/fi/jxcpjef86o0prl456cl2y/IDI-Process-Final-Draft.docx?rlkey=w9ykt9u3wcwwbttfwd9hod1df&st=osqe69uv&dl=0\nThank you,\nKaitlin Nonweiler\u00a0\n(she/her/hers)\nIDI Administrator\u00a0\u00a0\nEmail: \nk.nonweiler@lcwmail.com",

Sounds good to me.\u00a0\n\u00a0\nYes, Zoom has three options- option 2 'attendees need to register for each occurence to attend' Registrants need to register separately for each occurrence to attend. They can only choose one date and time on the registrant page.would fit best as that option only allows a participant to register for a single session only. registrant cancels, they will need to re-register to attend any future sessions.\u00a0\n2. Registrant cancellations: I did not receive an email saying that you cancelled. I researched it, and it looks like Zoom does NOT send an email to the host when a registrant cancels their registration. The host has to manually check the registrant list within the Zoom web portal to see who has cancelled. \n\u00a0\nFrom:\n Rebecca Parrilla <\nr.parrilla@lcwmail.com\n>\nSent:\n Wednesday, March 26, 2025 9:32 AM\nTo:\n Kaitlin Nonweiler <\nk.nonweiler@lcwmail.com\n>\nCc:\n Juri Mansour <\nj.mansour@lcwmail.com\n>\nSubject:\n GroupM - couple Zoom questions\n \n\u00a0\nHi Kaitlin, thank you so much for your help in finalizing our session scheduling process with Group M. \n\u00a0\nGroupM will be sending out registration links for eight sessions at a time, just like you did for the test run last week. \n\u00a0\nWe met with them today and they have two additional questions.\n\u00a0\nIs LCW able to set up the registration link on the back end such that any given email (participant) can register for a \nsingle session only\n and is prevented from registering for more multiple sessions? In other words, the person would need to cancel their initial registration in order to register for a different session?\n\u00a0\nI see that when participants get a registration confirmation email there is an option to edit or cancel their registration details, e.g.:\n\u00a0\nGroup M would like to know about cancelations as they happen, so they could offer this seat to others. Do you know if the meeting organizer (in this case it would be me, bc it\u2019d be on my zoom account) is notified participant cancelations as they happen? I just canceled my registration to the GroupM TEST meeting and got this screen:\n\u00a0\nDid you get a notification that I canceled? \n\u00a0\nThank you very much!\n\u00a0\nRebecca M.

Sounds good to me.\u00a0\nYes, Zoom has three options- option 2 'attendees need to register for each occurence to attend' Registrants need to register separately for each occurrence to attend. They can only choose one date and time on the registrant page.would fit best as that option only allows a participant to register for a single session only. registrant cancels, they will need to re-register to attend any future sessions.\u00a0\n2. Registrant cancellations: I did not receive an email saying that you cancelled. I researched it, and it looks like Zoom does NOT send an email to the host when a registrant cancels their registration. The host has to manually check the registrant list within the Zoom web portal to see who has cancelled. \nFrom:\n Rebecca Parrilla <r.parrilla@lcwmail.com>\nSent:\n Wednesday, March 26, 2025 9:32 AM\nTo:\n Kaitlin Nonweiler <k.nonweiler@lcwmail.com>\nCc:\n Juri Mansour <j.mansour@lcwmail.com>\nSubject:\n GroupM - couple Zoom questions\n \n\u00a0\nHi Kaitlin, thank you so much for your help in finalizing our session scheduling process with Group M. \n\u00a0\nGroupM will be sending out registration links for eight sessions at a time, just like you did for the test run last week. \n\u00a0\nWe met with them today and they have two additional questions.\n\u00a0\nIs LCW able to set up the registration link on the back end such that any given email (participant) can register for a \nsingle session only\n and is prevented from registering for more multiple sessions? In other words, the person would need to cancel their initial registration in order to register for a different session?\n\u00a0\nI see that when participants get a registration confirmation email there is an option to edit or cancel their registration details, e.g.:\n\u00a0\nGroup M would like to know about cancelations as they happen, so they could offer this seat to others. Do you know if the meeting organizer (in this case it would be me, bc it\u2019d be on my zoom account) is notified participant cancelations as they happen? I just canceled my registration to the GroupM TEST meeting and got this screen:\n\u00a0\nDid you get a notification that I canceled? \n\u00a0\nThank you very much!\n\u00a0\nRebecca M.

I know we should be able to pull but I just want confirmation in case any wired tech stuff comes up with Zoom while pulling so we can troubleshoot before proceeding with the client.\nWe will not need the first method at the moment but I could see this being used for make up sessions in the future.\nOnce you confirm the registration was pulled successfully, I will route the confirmation to the client. If this can be done as soon as possible as the client is waiting for this piece to launch their internal comms regarding the sessions.\nThank you!\nJuri Mansour (She/Her)\nConsultant Project Associate\nLCW\nFrom:\n\u00a0Kaitlin Nonweiler <k.nonweiler@lcwmail.com>\nSent:\n\u00a0Wednesday, March 5, 2025 11:18 AM\nTo:\n\u00a0Juri Mansour <j.mansour@lcwmail.com>; Rebecca Parrilla <r.parrilla@lcwmail.com>\nCc:\n\u00a0Nicole Barile <n.barile@lcwmail.com>; Chuck Adams <c.adams@lcwmail.com>\nSubject:\n\u00a0Re: GroupM Zoom Questions\n \n\u00a0\nThe first method would be good if the client had a list of people they wanted registered for a certain session, then I would go into Zoom and register them.

You can see which one you think would work best.\u00a0\nMethod 1: Similar to our Webinars, I uploaded a spreadsheet with the registrants' info (see pic below).

And can we customize the text on it for them?\n\u00a0\nYes, the Zoom registration confirmation email typically includes an option to add the session details to a participant's calendar by clicking\u00a0an \"Add to Calendar\" button, allowing them to add the event to their\u00a0calendar. But THEY have to click the button and add it.\u00a0 And I can change the email contact to someone besides the primary host, even though it's their account the session is made under.\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00b7\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \nHow does the reg link work when there are many session dates/times to choose from? Do we give them a different reg link for each session? \u00a0A Zoom meeting can have what they call multiple \"occurrences.\" When you select that registration for the occurrences/sessions is required, you get to choose from three options (see below).\u00a0\nYou can set up the registration page to have multiple dates and times for them to choose from. See the example below. No need for a registration page per session.\u00a0\n\u00a0\nPlease let me know\u00a0if you have any questions!\n\u00a0\nThank you,\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\nJuri Mansour (She/Her)\nConsultant Project Associate\nLCW\n\u00a0\nDisclaimer\nThe information contained in this communication from the sender is confidential.

Watch the on-demand recording of Cheree McAlpine, Chief Legal Officer at Zoom, and Hanan Szwarcbord, VP & Chief Security Officer at Micron Technology, as they share best practices for implementing AI within your organization. Szwarcbord discusses how he worked with legal and compliance teams on Micron\u2019s journey to enabling Zoom AI Companion, while McAlpine provides her perspective on AI as a CLO\u2019s standpoint.\u00a0\n\u00a0\nIntroducing Zoom Workflow Automation\nZoom Workflow Automation is now generally available! Think of how much time you spend on routine work tasks, like sending a weekly check-in message or duplicating information from one application to another.

Zoom\u2019s new Workflow Automation can help you get that valuable time back.\n\u00a0\nThis powerful tool streamlines work across Zoom Workplace and third-party apps, and leverages AI Companion to summarize and provide actionable insights. With it, you can trigger actions, integrate with external tools, and automate responses based on user interactions, such as emoji reactions. For example, you can keep teams aligned and organized by automatically adding AI Companion meeting summaries to a dedicated Zoom Doc that is then shared in a chat channel!\n\u00a0\nWorkflow Automation is now available to paid Zoom users at no additional cost during the free trial period. Visit our support pages to learn how to \nenable\n and \nuse\n Workflow Automation. Users must be on Zoom Workplace app to version 6.3.10 or higher to access this feature. And click the button below\u00a0\nfor an overview of what Workflow Automation can do for you!\nLearn More About Workflow Automation\n \n\u00a0\n\u00a0\nHow Zoom AI Companion Can Help You\nThe day-to-day work of an IT administrator looks very different from their colleagues in the marketing department, but Zoom AI Companion can help both of these groups work more efficiently \u2014 and they aren\u2019t the only ones!\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\nWhether you\u2019re already a daily AI Companion user or still thinking about taking the leap, we wanted to provide some inspiration to help you find new ways this powerful tool can streamline your daily tasks.

I know we should be able to pull but I just want confirmation in case any wired tech stuff comes up with Zoom while pulling so we can troubleshoot before proceeding with the client.\nWe will not need the first method at the moment but I could see this being used for make up sessions in the future.\nOnce you confirm the registration was pulled successfully, I will route the confirmation to the client. If this can be done as soon as possible as the client is waiting for this piece to launch their internal comms regarding the sessions.\nThank you!\nJuri Mansour (She/Her)\nConsultant Project Associate\nLCW\nFrom:\n Kaitlin Nonweiler <k.nonweiler@lcwmail.com>\nSent:\n Wednesday, March 5, 2025 11:18 AM\nTo:\n Juri Mansour <j.mansour@lcwmail.com>; Rebecca Parrilla <r.parrilla@lcwmail.com>\nCc:\n Nicole Barile <n.barile@lcwmail.com>; Chuck Adams <c.adams@lcwmail.com>\nSubject:\n Re: GroupM Zoom Questions\n \n\u00a0\nThe first method would be good if the client had a list of people they wanted registered for a certain session, then I would go into Zoom and register them.

You can see which one you think would work best.\u00a0\nMethod 1: Similar to our Webinars, I uploaded a spreadsheet with the registrants' info (see pic below).

You can customize the email subject, body of the email, and you can add branding.\u00a0\n\u00a0\nCan our Zoom automatically send registrants a calendar invitation? And can we customize the text on it for them?\n\u00a0\nYes, the Zoom registration confirmation email typically includes an option to add the session details to a participant's calendar by clicking\u00a0an \"Add to Calendar\" button, allowing them to add the event to their\u00a0calendar. But THEY have to click the button and add it.\u00a0 And I can change the email contact to someone besides the primary host, even though it's their account the session is made under.\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00b7\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \nHow does the reg link work when there are many session dates/times to choose from? Do we give them a different reg link for each session? \u00a0A Zoom meeting can have what they call multiple \"occurrences.\" When you select that registration for the occurrences/sessions is required, you get to choose from three options (see below).\u00a0\nYou can set up the registration page to have multiple dates and times for them to choose from. See the example below. No need for a registration page per session.\u00a0\n\u00a0\nPlease let me know\u00a0if you have any questions!\n\u00a0\nThank you,\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\nJuri Mansour (She/Her)\nConsultant Project Associate\nLCW\n\u00a0\nDisclaimer\nThe information contained in this communication from the sender is confidential.

You can customize the email subject, body of the email, and you can add branding.\u00a0\n\u00a0\nCan our Zoom automatically send registrants a calendar invitation? And can we customize the text on it for them?\n\u00a0\nYes, the Zoom registration confirmation email typically includes an option to add the session details to a participant's calendar by clicking\u00a0an \"Add to Calendar\" button, allowing them to add the event to their\u00a0calendar. But THEY have to click the button and add it.\u00a0 And I can change the email contact to someone besides the primary host, even though it's their account the session is made under.\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00b7\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \nHow does the reg link work when there are many session dates/times to choose from? Do we give them a different reg link for each session? \u00a0A Zoom meeting can have what they call multiple \"occurrences.\" When you select that registration for the occurrences/sessions is required, you get to choose from three options (see below).\u00a0\nYou can set up the registration page to have multiple dates and times for them to choose from.

You can customize the email subject, body of the email, and you can add branding.\u00a0\n\u00a0\nCan our Zoom automatically send registrants a calendar invitation? And can we customize the text on it for them?\n\u00a0\nYes, the Zoom registration confirmation email typically includes an option to add the session details to a participant's calendar by clicking\u00a0an \"Add to Calendar\" button, allowing them to add the event to their\u00a0calendar. But THEY have to click the button and add it.\u00a0 And I can change the email contact to someone besides the primary host, even though it's their account the session is made under.\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00b7\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \nHow does the reg link work when there are many session dates/times to choose from? Do we give them a different reg link for each session? \u00a0A Zoom meeting can have what they call multiple \"occurrences.\" When you select that registration for the occurrences/sessions is required, you get to choose from three options (see below).\u00a0\nYou can set up the registration page to have multiple dates and times for them to choose from. See the example below. No need for a registration page per session.\u00a0\n\u00a0\nPlease let me know\u00a0if you have any questions!\n\u00a0\nThank you,\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\nJuri Mansour (She/Her)\nConsultant Project Associate\nLCW\n\u00a0\nDisclaimer\nThe information contained in this communication from the sender is confidential.

You can customize the email subject, body of the email, and you can add branding.\u00a0\n\u00a0\nCan our Zoom automatically send registrants a calendar invitation? And can we customize the text on it for them?\n\u00a0\nYes, the Zoom registration confirmation email typically includes an option to add the session details to a participant's calendar by clicking\u00a0an \"Add to Calendar\" button, allowing them to add the event to their\u00a0calendar. But THEY have to click the button and add it.\u00a0 And I can change the email contact to someone besides the primary host, even though it's their account the session is made under.\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00b7\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \nHow does the reg link work when there are many session dates/times to choose from? Do we give them a different reg link for each session? \u00a0A Zoom meeting can have what they call multiple \"occurrences.\" When you select that registration for the occurrences/sessions is required, you get to choose from three options (see below).\u00a0\nYou can set up the registration page to have multiple dates and times for them to choose from. See the example below. No need for a registration page per session.\u00a0\n\u00a0\nPlease let me know\u00a0if you have any questions!\n\u00a0\nThank you,\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\nJuri Mansour (She/Her)\nConsultant Project Associate\nLCW\n\u00a0\nDisclaimer\nThe information contained in this communication from the sender is confidential.

And can we customize the text on it for them?\n\u00a0\nYes, the Zoom registration confirmation email typically includes an option to add the session details to a participant's calendar by clicking\u00a0an \"Add to Calendar\" button, allowing them to add the event to their\u00a0calendar.

I was just starting to look for someone to do this on UpWork & then thought....maybe you would be interested. The catch is that we are paying less per hour - much less - for this. We are offering $12/hr for this work.\u00a0\nYou would be essentially calling and/or emailing different state agencies to geet more details on things. This is mostly related to state unemployment and workers compensation.\u00a0\nI've attached a doc that has more details. If you'd be interested, you would work with me, SG, and Alisa to solve this, as most of the time they need accounting or a leadership person to speak to.

Each participant (even alternate hosts) has\u00a0to register to receive a unique join link. I can register the External Zoom account, and we can give the host that join link.

Does a \"master\" spreadsheet exist with usernames and passwords? I have the ability to update the Zoom password for this account. But, I do not know the password for the email account. If you choose to use External Zoom, I can add it as an alternative host for the Leading Inclusively session for BSC EMEA.\n\u00a0\nFrom my research, there is no 'master' meeting link hosts can use when you create a Zoom meeting that requires registration. Each participant (even alternate hosts) has\u00a0to register to receive a unique join link. I can register the External Zoom account, and we can give the host that join link. I just need to be able to login to the email.\u00a0\n\u00a0\n-Kaitlin\nFrom:\n Rebecca Parrilla <\nr.parrilla@lcwmail.com\n>\nSent:\n Thursday, February 27, 2025 3:31 PM\nTo:\n Kaitlin Nonweiler <\nk.nonweiler@lcwmail.com\n>\nCc:\n Juri Mansour <\nj.mansour@lcwmail.com\n>; Nicole Barile <\nn.barile@lcwmail.com\n>\nSubject:\n Adding external facilitator as a host for BSC EMEA session on March 10th \n\u00a0\nHi Kaitlin,\nTatyana Fertelmeyster (external facilitator) will be delivering the March 10\nth\n \u201cLeading Inclusively\u201d session for BSC EMEA (start time is 6am).

    "body": "Juri, Please see the answers to your questions below. I hope this helps! :)\u00a0\nCan the Zoom link registration email that will go out after a participant registers be customizable so that it is easy to search in their email? \nYes, the Zoom registration confirmation email can be customized. You can customize the email subject, body of the email, and you can add branding.\u00a0\n\u00a0\nCan we set up calendar invitations with zoom registration? For example, once someone registers is there an option to include the event on their calendar?\n \nYes, the\u00a0 Zoom registration confirmation email typically includes an option to add the session details to a participant's calendar by clicking\u00a0an \"Add to Calendar\" button, allowing them to add the event to their\u00a0calendar. But THEY have to click the button and add it.\u00a0 And I can change the email contact to someone besides the primary host, even though its their account the session is made under.\u00a0\nSince there are multiple sessions happening on multiple days, how does this work with zoom registration? Currently I understand that for zoom registration we get a link that would take the participant to the registration page and then when they register, they get a unique link.\nA Zoom meeting can have what they call multiple \"occurrences.\" When you select that registration for the occurances/sessions is required, you get to choose from three options (see below). I think this also answers your last question.\u00a0\nCan we input multiple dates and times for them to choose on that registration page or will we need to have a registration page for every session? \nYes, you can set up the registration page to have multiple dates and times for them to choose from. See the example below. No need for a registration page per session.\u00a0\n-Kaitlin\u00a0\nFrom:\n Juri Mansour <j.mansour@lcwmail.com>\nSent:\n Monday, March 3, 2025 10:46 AM\nTo:\n Kaitlin Nonweiler <k.nonweiler@lcwmail.com>; Rebecca Parrilla <r.parrilla@lcwmail.com>\nSubject:\n GroupM Zoom Registration Questions\n \n\u00a0\nHello Kaitlin,\nI was wondering if you could provide clarity on the following questions regarding Zoom invitation set up in the scenario that a client wanted to have registered zoom links:\nCan the Zoom link registration\u00a0 email that will go out after a participant registers be customizaible so that it is easy to search in their email?\nCan we set up calendar invitations with zoom registration?

    "body": "Hello Kaitlin,\nI was wondering if you could provide clarity on the following questions regarding Zoom invitation set up in the scenario that a client wanted to have registered zoom links:\nCan the Zoom link registration\u00a0 email that will go out after a participant registers be customizaible so that it is easy to search in their email?\nCan we set up calendar invitations with zoom registration? For example, once someone registers is there an option to include the event on their calendar?\nSince there are multiple sessions happening on multiple days, how does this work with zoom registration? Currently I understand that for zoom registration we get a link that would take the participant to the registration page and then when they register, they get a unique link.\n\u00a0\u2002\u2002\u2002\u2002\u2002Can we input multiple dates and times for them to choose on that registration page or will we need to \u2002\u2002\u2002\u2002\u2002\u2002have a registration page for every session?\nThanks!\nJuri Mansour (She/Her)\nConsultant Project Associate\nLCW",

Each participant (even alternate hosts) has\u00a0to register to receive a unique join link. I can register the External Zoom account, and we can give the host that join link.

Dear Valued Customer, As Zoom evolves, we want to help you stay up to date on how the latest products and features can help you work and collaborate\n \nIn 2025, be more efficient with Zoom\u2019s AI Companion. \n \nDear Valued Customer,\n \n\u00a0 \nAs Zoom evolves, we want to help you stay up to date on how the latest products and features can help you work and collaborate better. We\u2019ll outline some highlights below, including opportunities for further learning.\n \n\u00a0 \nTo get more detailed information about the latest releases, here are a few resources:\u00a0\n \nZoom Digital Customer Success Hub\n - This event hub is full of training and information sessions hosted by the Zoom Digital Customer Success team.\u00a0\n \nWhat\u2019s New at Zoom blog\n - The blog is a great spot to keep up with Zoom, and the What\u2019s New post is regularly updated with info about new products and features.\u00a0\n \nPreview notes\n - A list of upcoming features. This page is only available to Zoom account owners and admins; you must sign in to view them.\n \nRelease notes\n - A complete list of past releases across the Zoom platform.\u00a0\n \n\u00a0 \nIf you have questions about the features and announcements outlined below, please reply directly to this email.\n \n\u00a0\n*Note: Some products and features may not be available to all customers.\n \nEvents & Training\nZoom Contact Center Insights: Success Stories & New Feature Deep Dives -\n \nRegister now\n \nto learn more about the latest ZCC features and how they can help you streamline your data center operations.\u00a0\n \nIn 2025, be more efficient with Zoom\u2019s AI Companion\n \nYou may have heard about Zoom\u2019s AI Companion 2.0 when we announced it last year during Zoomtopia. To help you work and collaborate more effectively in 2025, we wanted to take a closer look at this included* tool and how you can implement it within your organization.\u00a0\n \nAsk AI Companion questions about what has happened in a meeting to quickly catch up!\n \nWhat is AI Companion 2.0?\nAI Companion 2.0 is your next-generation AI assistant that surfaces important information in a convenient side panel, helping you prioritize what matters most and providing suggestions to help you stay on top of your work. With this tool, you can: \n\u00a0\nUse prompt suggestions and generate answers from AI Companion\n via a convenient side panel across Zoom Workplace, including Zoom Meetings, Zoom Team Chat, Zoom Docs, Zoom Calendar, and Zoom Mail.\u00a0\n \nExpand the context of information.\n \nAI Companion helps you stay organized and on top of your day because it has context from your data generated across Zoom Workplace, including your Zoom Meetings and, when connected, information from Microsoft Outlook, Gmail, Google Calendar, and uploaded files from Microsoft Office and Google Docs. AI Companion remembers previous conversations you\u2019ve had within the side panel and interactions from across Zoom Workplace.\n \nGenerate next steps from a meeting summary\n and, coming soon, AI Companion will be able to automatically turn those next steps into Zoom Tasks to help keep teams aligned and on track to deliver projects on time. Keep an eye out for the release of Zoom Tasks in the near future.\u00a0\n \nSummarize unread messages within a Zoom Team Chat channel\n to easily stay up to date on team conversations and avoid getting bogged down in unread chats. Within the new home tab, AI Companion will be able to provide users with a list of updates based on unread chats and emails.\n \nRecap email threads\n in Zoom Mail\n without having to read every message.\n \n \nThe AI Companion side panel in the Zoom Workplace app can help answer your questions. Use the prompts or ask your own!\n \nHow do I manage AI Companion 2.0 for my account?\n \nAs an account admin or owner, you can control AI Companion features in the Zoom web portal.

I'm gathering the details & will share soon. Depending on the training, we may have you observe a session (with one of our full-time staff delivering), then ask you to deliver on your own while being observed by one of our facilitators, and then you can deliver on your own.\u00a0\n\u00a0\nThis is only because the clients we have facilitations for are extremely sensitive clients, and they are extremely picky about who facilitates. We've also had some service issues in the past with one of these clients & have to be extra cautious. This does not reflect your ability, rather us covering our butts to ensure that everything goes smoothly.\n\u00a0\nThe trainings may include: Leading Inclusively, Building an Inclusive Culture, or How Culture Influences Communication.\nI hope this all makes sense. Apologies for the directness of this email. I'm rushing to get you more info asap on the client(s) & course names. Will have that to you soon. Hopefully you will be interested & available.\n\u00a0\nThank you!\nNicole\nFrom:\n\u00a0Yuri Brown-Cruzat <\nyuri@epicinclusionsolutions.com\n>\nSent:\n\u00a0Friday, January 31, 2025 1:04 PM\nTo:\n\u00a0Nicole Barile <\nn.barile@lcwmail.com\n>\nSubject:\n\u00a0RE: Opportunities with LCW\n\u00a0\nYou too\u2026 \n\ud83d\ude0a\n\u00a0\nYuri Brown- Cruzat\n\u00a0\nManaging Director\u00a0\nSchedule an appointment\nw: \nwww.epicinclusionsolutions.com\np: \n7\n08-476-3606\nli:\n \nLinkedIn\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\nDisclaimer\nThe information contained in this communication from the sender is confidential.

People have been getting emails to sign up, and we've gotten about 20 people signed\u00a0up so far!\nWhat I'll need from you is your brain in figuring out the best way to send these people the Zoom link.\nWe had people sign up in HubSpot so we could capture a lot of data.\nWhat I'm wondering now is, what's next?\nI can download the registered people as a list I can share with you.\nIs it best we simply send them a calendar invite from Outlook.... (not sure if we can Bcc)... OR is it better to have you manually register them in Zoom so they get an email with the Zoom link & then then can choose to add it to their calendar... OR ...???\nI'll schedule a time for us on Monday to chat through this. If you can come up with ideas for how best to approach it prior to our call, that would\u00a0be great. LMK if you have\u00a0any questions in the meantime.\nThanks!!\nNicole Barile\n\u00a0\n(She/Her)\nChief Operating Officer\nLCW\nWebsite\n\u00a0\n|\n\u00a0\nTwitter\n\u00a0\n|\n\u00a0\nFacebook\n\u00a0\n|\n\u00a0\nLinkedIn\nView our upcoming events\n\u00a0| \nSign-up for our newsletter",

If you don't, lmk, and I'll change your permissions.\nCould you please give it a try & see if you can delete them? You can see my notes in Column O. I started highlighting the people in red, but then I stopped\u00a0 \ud83d\ude42. Column O will indicate whether they should be removed.\nIf this can be done by this Friday that would be great.

I think Briza got the paid version because it allows you to create a team; however, you can still share the scribes with others with the free version.

I think Briza got the paid version because it allows you to create a team; however, you can still share the scribes with others with the free version. If we switch to a different plan, I hope we don't lose the current scribes.

I have never been this sick so I would appreciate your patience with me. I am functional though my ability to speak will be limited until I recover more hopefully sooner rather than later.\u00a0I will reserve my speaking for client meetings and on rest of meetings I will reply in chat unless absolutely necessary to speak.\nThank you for your understanding & patience.

We also introduced a new generation of AI assistant \u2014 AI Companion 2.0 \u2014 to help you work and collaborate more efficiently and effectively. \n\u00a0\nBefore we dive into a recap of 2024, let\u2019s take a look at how we\u2019re kicking off the new year!\n\u00a0\n*Note: Some products and features may not be available to all customers.\n \nNew this year: Redesigned flexible Team Chat sidebar\n \nWhen you update to Zoom app version 6.3.6, you may notice the newly redesigned Team Chat sidebar. With the new customizable sidebar, you can easily organize your workspace by choosing which tabs appear with drag and drop, keeping essentials like direct messages and continuous meeting chats just a click away, decluttering notifications with tab-level badging, accessing a full-suite of tabs under \u201cMore,\u201d and quickly finding what you need using advanced sorting and filtering. \nPlus, you can use AI Companion to automate everyday busywork so you can stay on top of what matters and get more done by summarizing unread conversations in key tabs like Folders and Starred, generating action items based on a conversation in any channel, searching for topics and files across chats, and composing messages for you \u2014 all in one place. \nCheck out our \nblog post\n if you want to learn more about what's possible with Team Chat!\nService Updates\n \nZoom Software Lifecycle Policy -\n \nWe plan to enforce the next round of our Software Lifecycle Policy on February 1, 2025. Please check our \nsupport article\n for the table of products and corresponding minimum versions. Users who are running an end-of-life version after February 1 will be logged out of their Zoom app (Desktop, Mobile, and VDI) or not be able to join meetings via the Zoom Client until they update. As always, we highly recommend you regularly download and update to the latest version of Zoom software by checking for updates within the Zoom app or by navigating to \nzoom.us/download\n to take advantage of all our latest security and functionality features.\n \nZoom firewall settings -\n \nWe are starting to route more traffic across our newer data centers. We want to remind customers to please allow Zoom traffic to all subnets located on our\u00a0\nZoom Network Firewall\n page, which includes specific sections by Product, for an optimal experience and to avoid any service disruption. Some of the recently added subnets specific to Zoom Phone & Zoom Contact Center are:\n \n144.195.0.0/16\n \n206.247.0.0/16\n \n170.114.0.0/16\n \n159.124.0.0/16\n \n147.124.96.0/19\n \nHighlights from 2024\n \nNow that we\u2019ve looked at how we\u2019re kicking off the new year, here are just a few of the many milestones from 2024:\u00a0\n \nFast Company names Zoom one of the world\u2019s most innovative companies of 2024\n \n-\n Zoom was named to Fast Company\u2019s prestigious list of the World\u2019s Most Innovative Companies of 2024. The list shines a spotlight on businesses that are shaping industry and culture through their innovations. These organizations are setting new standards and achieving remarkable milestones in all sectors of the economy. Alongside the World\u2019s 50 Most Innovative Companies, Fast Company recognizes 606 organizations across 58 sectors and regions.\n \nZoom Compliance Manager launches\n \n-\n In the spring of 2024, we launched Zoom Compliance Manager powered by Theta Lake, a new all-in-one offering that provides archiving, eDiscovery, legal hold, and information protection capabilities to help organizations fulfill regulatory requirements and mitigate organizational communications compliance risks across the Zoom platform.\n \nZoom Workplaces launches, weaving AI throughout the experience\n \n-\n \nIn April 2024, we launched Zoom Workplace, our new, AI-powered collaboration platform designed to help your organization reimagine teamwork by streamlining communications, increasing employee engagement, and improving productivity across flexible work. It\u2019s everything you trust and love about Zoom\u2019s core communications products, combined with our employee engagement, spaces, and productivity solutions, all within the Zoom experience, with AI woven throughout.\u00a0\n \nAI Onboarding Center helps organizations integrate AI Companion\n \n-\n Many tasks can be completed more quickly and efficiently with the help of AI Companion, but that doesn\u2019t mean everyone knows how to take advantage of them. To help administrators and employees take advantage of Zoom AI Companion and start changing the way they work, we created a new \nresource hub\n with downloadable, ready-to-share assets for every product that works with Zoom AI Companion.\n \nZoom introduces beta for Workflow Automation, a no-code workflow builder to boost workplace efficiency\n \n-\n \nZoom launched the new Workflow Automation in beta, allowing users to increase efficiency and reduce time spent on routine tasks. Workflow Automation helps users build complex workflows across Zoom Workplace and third-party applications so they can spend time on more meaningful work and collaborate more seamlessly with colleagues.\u00a0\n \nSingle-use Zoom Webinars licenses capacity increased to 1 million attendees\n \n-\n\u00a0We made it easier than ever to host an extra-large, high-capacity virtual gathering with our newest offering: single-use Zoom Webinars licenses that accommodate up to 1 million attendees. Ideal for presenting content to large audiences who don\u2019t need to connect their audio and video to one another, Zoom Webinars is built on our easy-to-use, familiar platform that so many customers have come to know and trust. Our flexible and scalable solutions now enable event organizers to host massive, one-time virtual gatherings with relative ease.\n \nAI-first Zoom Docs debuts on Zoom Workplace\n \n-\n In August 2024, Zoom launched our AI-first collaborative docs solution. Zoom Docs is powered by Zoom AI Companion, and helps drive productivity and seamless collaboration throughout Zoom Workplace. Zoom Docs can help solve critical challenges facing modern workforces, including time wasted on repetitive tasks, information overload, and facilitation of cross-functional alignment. By utilizing Zoom AI Companion to convert meeting outcomes into actionable documents, Zoom Docs can jumpstart content creation and adapt to different individual and team needs to help boost workers\u2019 productivity.\u00a0\n \nWorkvivo named the only preferred migration partner for Workplace from Meta\n \n-\n \nAs Meta prepared to discontinue their Workplace product, they named Workvivo by Zoom as their only preferred migration partner. Meta and Workvivo worked together to provide \nmigration tools\n for migrating and Workvivo provided additional migration services at no further cost to support customers\u2019 transition.\n \nZoom recognized as a Customers\u2019 Choice in the Gartner\u00ae Peer Insights\u2122\n \n-\n Zoom was recognized as a Customers\u2019 Choice in the 2024 Gartner\u00ae Peer Insights\u2122 \u201cVoice of the Customer\u201d report for Unified Communications as a Service (UCaaS). According to Gartner, vendors recognized by customers as a Customers\u2019 Choice meet or exceed the market average for Overall Experience and User Interest and Adoption.\u00a0\n \nZoom introduces AI Companion 2.0\n \n-\n\u00a0At Zoomtopia 2024, Zoom announced the next generation of Zoom AI Companion, the AI personal assistant that helps users get more done and is available at no additional cost. Since launching in September 2023, AI Companion has been enabled on more than 4 million accounts, helping users with capabilities like meeting summary, meeting questions, chat compose, and more. The next generation of AI Companion continues to help simplify users\u2019 workdays by sorting through the noise and prioritizing what\u2019s most important with high-quality results.\u00a0\n \nZoom named a Leader in the 2024 Gartner\u00ae Magic Quadrant\u2122(October) Gartner Magic Quadrant\n \n-\n \nGartner named Zoom a Leader in the 2024 Gartner\u00ae Magic Quadrant\u2122 for Unified Communications as a Service (UCaaS), Worldwide for the fifth time in a row. The UCaaS report evaluated 11 companies in the unified communications space, and Zoom has been recognized as a Leader in this area.

Could you please help me understand how that works? How are we able to capture participant names If they don't register with their emails? \u00a0\nSeparately, The Group M Workshop is going from two hours to 90 minutes . would you need to adjust the time frame in the zoom meeting link on the back end at all? \u00a0Thank you!\n\u00a0\nRebecca M.

If we just need names, we/client will need to remind the participants to ensure their names are\u00a0correct for attendance purposes.\u00a0\n\u00a0\nYes, I can adjust the timeframe in the Zoom meeting link. Can you remind me of the facilitator and the dates of the GroupM Workshop? Do we have a spreadsheet?\n\u00a0\n-Kaitlin\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\nFrom:\n Rebecca Parrilla <\nr.parrilla@lcwmail.com\n>\nSent:\n Tuesday, January 14, 2025 3:55 PM\nTo:\n Kaitlin Nonweiler <\nk.nonweiler@lcwmail.com\n>\nSubject:\n Question ab Zoom attendance for GroupM\n \n\u00a0\nHi Kaitlin, how are you? I hope your 2025 is off to a good start!\nI'm taking over the GroupM relationship from Sarah. Juri and I are preparing for our call with them tomorrow and I have a question. \u00a0From my experience with the zoom links for Boston Scientific I thought that in order to track participant names for attendance report purposes, you have to have a registration link where participants register. \u00a0But Juri informs me that we don't do that for Group M, we have a single zoom link that they use for all their sessions but somehow we are still able to capture the names of the participants in our attendance reports for GroupM. Could you please help me understand how that works? How are we able to capture participant names If they don't register with their emails? \u00a0\nSeparately, The Group M Workshop is going from two hours to 90 minutes . would you need to adjust the time frame in the zoom meeting link on the back end at all? \u00a0Thank you!\n\u00a0\nRebecca M.

I hope yours\u00a0is off to a good start!\u00a0\nTo capture the participants' email addresses, you have to have a registration link where participants register. Without a registration link, you can still track participant names for attendance report purposes if they join with their name; however, sometimes they don't, it will be a nickname or a number. If we just need names, we/client will need to remind the participants to ensure their names are\u00a0correct for attendance purposes.\u00a0\nYes, I can adjust the timeframe in the Zoom meeting link.

I hope your 2025 is off to a good start!\nI'm taking over the GroupM relationship from Sarah. Juri and I are preparing for our call with them tomorrow and I have a question. \u00a0From my experience with the zoom links for Boston Scientific I thought that in order to track participant names for attendance report purposes, you have to have a registration link where participants register. \u00a0But Juri informs me that we don't do that for Group M, we have a single zoom link that they use for all their sessions but somehow we are still able to capture the names of the participants in our attendance reports for GroupM. Could you please help me understand how that works? How are we able to capture participant names If they don't register with their emails? \u00a0\nSeparately, The Group M Workshop is going from two hours to 90 minutes . would you need to adjust the time frame in the zoom meeting link on the back end at all? \u00a0Thank you!\n\u00a0\nRebecca M.

    "body": "Hi Kaitlin, how are you? I hope your 2025 is off to a good start!\nI'm taking over the GroupM relationship from Sarah. Juri and I are preparing for our call with them tomorrow and I have a question. \u00a0From my experience with the zoom links for Boston Scientific I thought that in order to track participant names for attendance report purposes, you have to have a registration link where participants register. \u00a0But Juri informs me that we don't do that for Group M, we have a single zoom link that they use for all their sessions but somehow we are still able to capture the names of the participants in our attendance reports for GroupM. Could you please help me understand how that works? How are we able to capture participant names If they don't register with their emails? \u00a0\nSeparately, The Group M Workshop is going from two hours to 90 minutes . would you need to adjust the time frame in the zoom meeting link on the back end at all? \u00a0Thank you!\n\u00a0\nRebecca M.

    "body": "Hi everyone,\n\u00a0\nYes, pay dates for everyone will be the 1\nst\n and the 15\nth\n. It has been like this for a while, the change is that the time sheets will now match up with the periods. You\u2019ll be paid for a given time sheet one period after it ends (15-17 days depending on the month). So January 1-15 will be paid on Feb 1, same as salaried.\n\u00a0\nI know that the actual dates you received your payment have been variable in the past, which can cause problems for you, so I\u2019m working on changing processes so that things are more consistent. I will be initiating payments on or before the pay date, and the processing time is usually 2-3 business days. If the pay date falls on a weekend or holiday (like Feb 1\nst\n), I will process beforehand.\n\u00a0\nSince the 15\nth\n is this week and all of you (except Keri) are in the new system now, you\u2019ll be able to see how it works from your end right away. Keri, you will submit your first time sheet this week and your first pay date will be 2/1.\n\u00a0\nPlease let me know with any questions about this! Nicole is the approver, but I\u2019m the process owner so I handle all the technical bits and I want to make it as stress-free as possible.\n\u00a0\nSG\n\u00a0\nFrom:\n Nicole Barile <n.barile@lcwmail.com> \nSent:\n Monday, January 13, 2025 09:13\nTo:\n Juri Mansour <j.mansour@lcwmail.com>; Kaitlin Nonweiler <k.nonweiler@lcwmail.com>; Catalina De Sanctis <c.desanctis@lcwmail.com>; Keri Luo <k.luo@lcwmail.com>\nCc:\n Accounting <accounting@lcwmail.com>\nSubject:\n Re: Updated Timesheet & process\n\u00a0\nHi!

    "body": "Hi everyone! As promised, here is what you need to know about our bill pay process change. We will stop using Bill.com at the end of January, and are switching to QuickBooks Bill Pay (an Intuit brand). This is cheaper for the company, and offers better integration for my work. (Payroll for full-timers is not changing \u2013 this affects contractor and vendor payments only.)\n\u00a0\nPart-time and external consultants:\nYou should have already gotten an email from me and from Intuit to set up your free QuickBooks Money account so you can keep getting ACH payments. I can also input information manually if necessary.\nPlease be sure you are sending your time sheets/invoices to your approver (Chuck or Nicole) ONLY. They will then send it to me for processing (this prevents confusion and duplicates).\nIf you have any questions about your pay, please email Accounting or ping me in Teams.\n\u00a0\nSalaried folks who have expenses and get reimbursements: \nPlease continue sending your expense reports to Accounting ONLY as normal. Any reimbursements will be added into your paychecks instead of handled separately.\n\u00a0\nIf you are an approver of vendor invoices: \nPlease send the PDF invoice to \nlcw+expenses@assist.intuit.com\n and copy Accounting. The Intuit address is a bot inside the accounting software, so I need to also have it in my regular email in case it skips important things! \nFor questions or reminders about bills, please only email Accounting.\nSince it takes a few days minimum to set folks up in the new system, please be sure to send vendor invoices in a timely manner. \nDomestic vendors will get an email from me and Intuit after I get their first bill in the new system to set up their ACH payment account. \nVendors currently getting international wires, I will email to discuss options. Vendors on PayPal will not have any changes.\n\u00a0\nAny questions or problems, please let me know!\n\u00a0\n\u201cSG\u201d Gluckstein\n \n(they/them)\nAccountant\nLCW\nEmail: \naccounting@lcwmail.com\nPS: LCW will be closed December 24 through January 1.
