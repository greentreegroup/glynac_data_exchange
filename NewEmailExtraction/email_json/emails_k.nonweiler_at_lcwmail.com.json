Sounds good to me.\u00a0\n\u00a0\nYes, Zoom has three options- option 2 'attendees need to register for each occurence to attend' Registrants need to register separately for each occurrence to attend. They can only choose one date and time on the registrant page.would fit best as that option only allows a participant to register for a single session only. registrant cancels, they will need to re-register to attend any future sessions.\u00a0\n2. Registrant cancellations: I did not receive an email saying that you cancelled. I researched it, and it looks like Zoom does NOT send an email to the host when a registrant cancels their registration. The host has to manually check the registrant list within the Zoom web portal to see who has cancelled. \n\u00a0\nFrom:\n Rebecca Parrilla <\nr.parrilla@lcwmail.com\n>\nSent:\n Wednesday, March 26, 2025 9:32 AM\nTo:\n Kaitlin Nonweiler <\nk.nonweiler@lcwmail.com\n>\nCc:\n Juri Mansour <\nj.mansour@lcwmail.com\n>\nSubject:\n GroupM - couple Zoom questions\n \n\u00a0\nHi Kaitlin, thank you so much for your help in finalizing our session scheduling process with Group M. \n\u00a0\nGroupM will be sending out registration links for eight sessions at a time, just like you did for the test run last week. \n\u00a0\nWe met with them today and they have two additional questions.\n\u00a0\nIs LCW able to set up the registration link on the back end such that any given email (participant) can register for a \nsingle session only\n and is prevented from registering for more multiple sessions? In other words, the person would need to cancel their initial registration in order to register for a different session?\n\u00a0\nI see that when participants get a registration confirmation email there is an option to edit or cancel their registration details, e.g.:\n\u00a0\nGroup M would like to know about cancelations as they happen, so they could offer this seat to others. Do you know if the meeting organizer (in this case it would be me, bc it\u2019d be on my zoom account) is notified participant cancelations as they happen? I just canceled my registration to the GroupM TEST meeting and got this screen:\n\u00a0\nDid you get a notification that I canceled? \n\u00a0\nThank you very much!\n\u00a0\nRebecca M.

    "body": "Hi Rebecca! Sounds good to me.\u00a0\nYes, Zoom has three options- option 2 'attendees need to register for each occurence to attend' Registrants need to register separately for each occurrence to attend. They can only choose one date and time on the registrant page.would fit best as that option only allows a participant to register for a single session only. registrant cancels, they will need to re-register to attend any future sessions.\u00a0\n2. Registrant cancellations: I did not receive an email saying that you cancelled. I researched it, and it looks like Zoom does NOT send an email to the host when a registrant cancels their registration. The host has to manually check the registrant list within the Zoom web portal to see who has cancelled. \nFrom:\n Rebecca Parrilla <r.parrilla@lcwmail.com>\nSent:\n Wednesday, March 26, 2025 9:32 AM\nTo:\n Kaitlin Nonweiler <k.nonweiler@lcwmail.com>\nCc:\n Juri Mansour <j.mansour@lcwmail.com>\nSubject:\n GroupM - couple Zoom questions\n \n\u00a0\nHi Kaitlin, thank you so much for your help in finalizing our session scheduling process with Group M. \n\u00a0\nGroupM will be sending out registration links for eight sessions at a time, just like you did for the test run last week. \n\u00a0\nWe met with them today and they have two additional questions.\n\u00a0\nIs LCW able to set up the registration link on the back end such that any given email (participant) can register for a \nsingle session only\n and is prevented from registering for more multiple sessions? In other words, the person would need to cancel their initial registration in order to register for a different session?\n\u00a0\nI see that when participants get a registration confirmation email there is an option to edit or cancel their registration details, e.g.:\n\u00a0\nGroup M would like to know about cancelations as they happen, so they could offer this seat to others. Do you know if the meeting organizer (in this case it would be me, bc it\u2019d be on my zoom account) is notified participant cancelations as they happen? I just canceled my registration to the GroupM TEST meeting and got this screen:\n\u00a0\nDid you get a notification that I canceled? \n\u00a0\nThank you very much!\n\u00a0\nRebecca M.

And can we customize the text on it for them?\n\u00a0\nYes, the Zoom registration confirmation email typically includes an option to add the session details to a participant's calendar by clicking\u00a0an \"Add to Calendar\" button, allowing them to add the event to their\u00a0calendar. But THEY have to click the button and add it.\u00a0 And I can change the email contact to someone besides the primary host, even though it's their account the session is made under.\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00b7\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \nHow does the reg link work when there are many session dates/times to choose from? Do we give them a different reg link for each session? \u00a0A Zoom meeting can have what they call multiple \"occurrences.\" When you select that registration for the occurrences/sessions is required, you get to choose from three options (see below).\u00a0\nYou can set up the registration page to have multiple dates and times for them to choose from.

You can customize the email subject, body of the email, and you can add branding.\u00a0\n\u00a0\nCan our Zoom automatically send registrants a calendar invitation? And can we customize the text on it for them?\n\u00a0\nYes, the Zoom registration confirmation email typically includes an option to add the session details to a participant's calendar by clicking\u00a0an \"Add to Calendar\" button, allowing them to add the event to their\u00a0calendar. But THEY have to click the button and add it.\u00a0 And I can change the email contact to someone besides the primary host, even though it's their account the session is made under.\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00b7\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \nHow does the reg link work when there are many session dates/times to choose from? Do we give them a different reg link for each session? \u00a0A Zoom meeting can have what they call multiple \"occurrences.\" When you select that registration for the occurrences/sessions is required, you get to choose from three options (see below).\u00a0\nYou can set up the registration page to have multiple dates and times for them to choose from. See the example below. No need for a registration page per session.\u00a0\n\u00a0\nPlease let me know\u00a0if you have any questions!\n\u00a0\nThank you,\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\nJuri Mansour (She/Her)\nConsultant Project Associate\nLCW\n\u00a0\nDisclaimer\nThe information contained in this communication from the sender is confidential.

That would prevent us from sending the reminder emails to people who have already registered and would help us to understand when we are underenrolled in a particular session.\n\u00a0\nBest,\nBrian\n\u00a0\nBRIAN DASHEW \n(he/him)\nHead of Learning, North America\n\u2014\u00a0\nwww.groupm.com\n\u00a0\n@groupmworldwide\n\u00a0\nFollow us on LinkedIn\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\nFrom:\n\u00a0Juri Mansour <\nj.mansour@lcwmail.com\n>\nSent:\n\u00a0Tuesday, March 4, 2025 11:06 AM\nTo:\n\u00a0Shelton Rankin <\nshelton.rankin@groupm.com\n>; Brian Dashew <\nbrian.dashew@groupm.com\n>; Lukeisha Paul <\nLukeisha.Paul@groupm.com\n>\nCc:\n\u00a0Rebecca Parrilla <\nr.parrilla@lcwmail.com\n>\nSubject:\n\u00a0GroupM Zoom Questions\n\u00a0\nExternal:\n\u00a0\nHi team,\n\u00a0\nAnswers for zoom questions below:\n\u00a0\nCan we customize the Zoom registration confirmation email that goes to participants?\u00a0Yes, the Zoom registration confirmation email can be customized. You can customize the email subject, body of the email, and you can add branding.\u00a0\n\u00a0\nCan our Zoom automatically send registrants a calendar invitation? And can we customize the text on it for them?\n\u00a0\nYes, the Zoom registration confirmation email typically includes an option to add the session details to a participant's calendar by clicking\u00a0an \"Add to Calendar\" button, allowing them to add the event to their\u00a0calendar. But THEY have to click the button and add it.\u00a0 And I can change the email contact to someone besides the primary host, even though it's their account the session is made under.\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00b7\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \nHow does the reg link work when there are many session dates/times to choose from? Do we give them a different reg link for each session? \u00a0A Zoom meeting can have what they call multiple \"occurrences.\" When you select that registration for the occurrences/sessions is required, you get to choose from three options (see below).\u00a0\nYou can set up the registration page to have multiple dates and times for them to choose from. See the example below. No need for a registration page per session.\u00a0\n\u00a0\nPlease let me know\u00a0if you have any questions!\n\u00a0\nThank you,\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\nJuri Mansour (She/Her)\nConsultant Project Associate\nLCW\n\u00a0\nDisclaimer\nThe information contained in this communication from the sender is confidential.
