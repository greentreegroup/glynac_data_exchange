We can adjust the\u00a0package to give them scores or try to adapt to their system of distinguishing learners with such limited LMS reporting features. But as shown with our testing, the packages have worked and we'll need their LMS to send us the exact settings that will be needed to accompany Del Monte's method of how they plan to distinguish learners who said Yes or No on the questionnaire.\u00a0\n\u00a0\nPerhaps their system only shows a complete pass/fail scenario? We'd need guidance from their LMS on how scores are captured and if it can distinguish a 50% score that \"fails\" but still passes the course.\u00a0\n\u00a0\nPlease note our so long back and forth comes from their limiting system and as you can notice we are flexible and doing our best to help them get what they need.\nPlease let us know.\nWe are happy to help.\nBest,\nCDS\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\nCatalina De Sanctis\nTranslation Specialist\nLCW\n<image003.png>\n\u00a0\nWebsite\n\u00a0| \nTwitter\n\u00a0| \nFacebook\n\u00a0| \nLinkedIn\nView our upcoming events\n\u00a0| \nSign-up for our newsletter\n\u00a0\nFrom:\n\u00a0Randi Mooney <\nrmooney@diligent.com\n>\nSent:\n\u00a0Thursday, February 20, 2025 1:49 PM\nTo:\n\u00a0Catalina De Sanctis <\nc.desanctis@lcwmail.com\n>\nCc:\n\u00a0Brian Luong <\nbluong@diligent.com\n>; Don Reyes <\ndreyes@diligent.com\n>; Karen Lai <\nklai@diligent.com\n>; Kumud Mishra <\nkmishra@diligent.com\n>; Jorgelina Venturi <\nj.venturi@lcwmail.com\n>\nSubject:\n\u00a0Re: Diligent - WO_DELMONTE_COC_080624 - Del Monte CoC\n\u00a0\nHello,\n\u00a0\nDel Monte will be following up with their LMS on this matter.

This method involves the least amount of scope increase since we're at the translation phase. See below for what I did to the package to relay to them. Then can use the Menu to skip to the Certification slide to test both clickable decisions.\n\u00a0\n<image019.png>\n\u00a0\nOn the screen below, when the learner selects the No, the course will complete when the final slide loads. If the learner selects Yes, then the course will register as incomplete when reaching the final slide. \nIf this is not enough for them, please have Del Monte describe how they are going to mitigate this issue for themselves internally with the limitations of their LMS, and we can adjust the package accordingly. \nSince their LMS doesn't allow the reportage they want, they need to decide how they are going to reach out to people who appear incomplete if this isn't good enough. That may even need to include adding language to the course that would then need translation. Reconfiguration/Testing of the course for numerical scores to be sent to signal the selected response in question, would take 1hr per language to adjust totaling $1400 ($140*10lg) additional to the scope on my end. The adjustment I did here would only increase the scope between $140-$280 overall to apply the fix.\n<image020.png>\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\nPlease let us know your comments.\nThanks!\nCDS\n\u00a0\nCatalina De Sanctis\nTranslation Specialist\nLCW\n<image021.png>\n\u00a0\nWebsite\n\u00a0| \nTwitter\n\u00a0| \nFacebook\n\u00a0| \nLinkedIn\nView our upcoming events\n\u00a0| \nSign-up for our newsletter\n\u00a0\nFrom:\n\u00a0Randi Mooney <\nrmooney@diligent.com\n>\nSent:\n\u00a0Tuesday, February 11, 2025 2:31 PM\nTo:\n\u00a0Catalina De Sanctis <\nc.desanctis@lcwmail.com\n>\nCc:\n\u00a0Brian Luong <\nbluong@diligent.com\n>; Don Reyes <\ndreyes@diligent.com\n>; Karen Lai <\nklai@diligent.com\n>; Kumud Mishra <\nkmishra@diligent.com\n>\nSubject:\n\u00a0Re: Diligent - WO_DELMONTE_COC_080624 - Del Monte CoC\n\u00a0\nHi Catalina,\n\u00a0\nI wanted to follow up to see if Dustin's new test file for Del Monte is ready?

But in the meantime, sent over an invite for Friday.\n\u00a0\nHere is a summary of the situation:\nDel Monte noted earlier this week that the SCORM 2004 test file worked well in their LMS but followed up asking if we could send them their test report.\nWe informed them that without explicit access to their LMS and metadata, it would not be possible to generate a report on their behalf.\nThey replied that their LMS does not allow for any reports to be exported. This is where the misunderstanding occurred.\nEarlier in the project, it was interpreted that they were not getting the desired information from SCORM 1.2 completion reports. That is why we decided to proceed with SCORM 2004 as it allows for customized reportage.\nWe have asked Del Monte to confirm with their LMS, Convercent, what type of reports or metadata can be generated or exported. Awaiting a response here.\nQuestions to discuss:\nIs there any way to run a report on behalf\u00a0of Del Monte?\nHave reporting capabilities been brought up in the prior year updates for Del Monte? If so, what was the recommendation?\nThanks!\n_________________________\nDiligent\nRandi Mooney (Doran),\n\u00a0she/her\nAdvisory Specialist II, Advisory & Consulting Services\nrmooney@diligent.com\n\u00a0| \ndiligent.com\n\u00a0\nFrom:\n\u00a0Catalina De Sanctis <\nc.desanctis@lcwmail.com\n>\nSent:\n\u00a0Wednesday, January 29, 2025 7:23 PM\nTo:\n\u00a0Randi Mooney <\nrmooney@diligent.com\n>; Brian Luong <\nbluong@diligent.com\n>\nCc:\n\u00a0Don Reyes <\ndreyes@diligent.com\n>; Karen Lai <\nklai@diligent.com\n>; Kumud Mishra <\nkmishra@diligent.com\n>\nSubject:\n\u00a0RE: Diligent - WO_DELMONTE_COC_080624 - Del Monte CoC\n\u00a0\nHello Randi,\nIm sorry, tomorrow is complicated.

We can adjust the\u00a0package to give them scores or try to adapt to their system of distinguishing learners with such limited LMS reporting features. But as shown with our testing, the packages have worked and we'll need their LMS to send us the exact settings that will be needed to accompany Del Monte's method of how they plan to distinguish learners who said Yes or No on the questionnaire.\u00a0\n\u00a0\nPerhaps their system only shows a complete pass/fail scenario? We'd need guidance from their LMS on how scores are captured and if it can distinguish a 50% score that \"fails\" but still passes the course.\u00a0\n\u00a0\nPlease note our so long back and forth comes from their limiting system and as you can notice we are flexible and doing our best to help them get what they need.\nPlease let us know.\nWe are happy to help.\nBest,\nCDS\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\nCatalina De Sanctis\nTranslation Specialist\nLCW\n<image003.png>\n\u00a0\nWebsite\n\u00a0| \nTwitter\n\u00a0| \nFacebook\n\u00a0| \nLinkedIn\nView our upcoming events\n\u00a0| \nSign-up for our newsletter\n\u00a0\nFrom:\n\u00a0Randi Mooney <\nrmooney@diligent.com\n>\nSent:\n\u00a0Thursday, February 20, 2025 1:49 PM\nTo:\n\u00a0Catalina De Sanctis <\nc.desanctis@lcwmail.com\n>\nCc:\n\u00a0Brian Luong <\nbluong@diligent.com\n>; Don Reyes <\ndreyes@diligent.com\n>; Karen Lai <\nklai@diligent.com\n>; Kumud Mishra <\nkmishra@diligent.com\n>; Jorgelina Venturi <\nj.venturi@lcwmail.com\n>\nSubject:\n\u00a0Re: Diligent - WO_DELMONTE_COC_080624 - Del Monte CoC\n\u00a0\nHello,\n\u00a0\nDel Monte will be following up with their LMS on this matter.

The issue we have is that we can't distinguish all blank scores that are incomplete, and we don't know if in fact they completed the course. We could even be ok with a blank score if the participant was able to complete the course.\n\u00a0\nThanks,\n_________________________\nDiligent\nRandi Mooney,\n\u00a0she/her\nAdvisory Specialist II, Advisory & Consulting Services\nrmooney@diligent.com\n\u00a0| \ndiligent.com\n\u00a0\nUpcoming PTO: February 20th - February 25th\n\u00a0\nFrom:\n\u00a0Catalina De Sanctis <\nc.desanctis@lcwmail.com\n>\nSent:\n\u00a0Thursday, February 20, 2025 9:56 AM\nTo:\n\u00a0Randi Mooney <\nrmooney@diligent.com\n>\nCc:\n\u00a0Brian Luong <\nbluong@diligent.com\n>; Don Reyes <\ndreyes@diligent.com\n>; Karen Lai <\nklai@diligent.com\n>; Kumud Mishra <\nkmishra@diligent.com\n>; Jorgelina Venturi <\nj.venturi@lcwmail.com\n>\nSubject:\n\u00a0RE: Diligent - WO_DELMONTE_COC_080624 - Del Monte CoC\n\u00a0\nEXTERNAL:\u00a0This email originated from outside of the organization.

This method involves the least amount of scope increase since we're at the translation phase. See below for what I did to the package to relay to them. Then can use the Menu to skip to the Certification slide to test both clickable decisions.\n\u00a0\n<image019.png>\n\u00a0\nOn the screen below, when the learner selects the No, the course will complete when the final slide loads. If the learner selects Yes, then the course will register as incomplete when reaching the final slide. \nIf this is not enough for them, please have Del Monte describe how they are going to mitigate this issue for themselves internally with the limitations of their LMS, and we can adjust the package accordingly. \nSince their LMS doesn't allow the reportage they want, they need to decide how they are going to reach out to people who appear incomplete if this isn't good enough. That may even need to include adding language to the course that would then need translation. Reconfiguration/Testing of the course for numerical scores to be sent to signal the selected response in question, would take 1hr per language to adjust totaling $1400 ($140*10lg) additional to the scope on my end. The adjustment I did here would only increase the scope between $140-$280 overall to apply the fix.\n<image020.png>\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\nPlease let us know your comments.\nThanks!\nCDS\n\u00a0\nCatalina De Sanctis\nTranslation Specialist\nLCW\n<image021.png>\n\u00a0\nWebsite\n\u00a0| \nTwitter\n\u00a0| \nFacebook\n\u00a0| \nLinkedIn\nView our upcoming events\n\u00a0| \nSign-up for our newsletter\n\u00a0\nFrom:\n\u00a0Randi Mooney <\nrmooney@diligent.com\n>\nSent:\n\u00a0Tuesday, February 11, 2025 2:31 PM\nTo:\n\u00a0Catalina De Sanctis <\nc.desanctis@lcwmail.com\n>\nCc:\n\u00a0Brian Luong <\nbluong@diligent.com\n>; Don Reyes <\ndreyes@diligent.com\n>; Karen Lai <\nklai@diligent.com\n>; Kumud Mishra <\nkmishra@diligent.com\n>\nSubject:\n\u00a0Re: Diligent - WO_DELMONTE_COC_080624 - Del Monte CoC\n\u00a0\nHi Catalina,\n\u00a0\nI wanted to follow up to see if Dustin's new test file for Del Monte is ready?

But in the meantime, sent over an invite for Friday.\n\u00a0\nHere is a summary of the situation:\nDel Monte noted earlier this week that the SCORM 2004 test file worked well in their LMS but followed up asking if we could send them their test report.\nWe informed them that without explicit access to their LMS and metadata, it would not be possible to generate a report on their behalf.\nThey replied that their LMS does not allow for any reports to be exported. \nThis is where the misunderstanding occurred.\nEarlier in the project, it was interpreted that they were not getting the desired information from SCORM 1.2 completion reports. That is why we decided to proceed with SCORM 2004 as it allows for customized reportage.\nWe have asked Del Monte to confirm with their LMS, Convercent, what type of reports or metadata can be generated or exported. \nAwaiting a response here.\nQuestions to discuss:\nIs there any way to run a report on behalf\u00a0of Del Monte?\nHave reporting capabilities been brought up in the prior year updates for Del Monte? \nIf so, what was the recommendation?\nThanks!\n_________________________\nDiligent\nRandi Mooney (Doran),\n\u00a0she/her\nAdvisory Specialist II, Advisory & Consulting Services\nrmooney@diligent.com\n\u00a0| \ndiligent.com\n\u00a0\nFrom:\n\u00a0Catalina De Sanctis <\nc.desanctis@lcwmail.com\n>\nSent:\n\u00a0Wednesday, January 29, 2025 7:23 PM\nTo:\n\u00a0Randi Mooney <\nrmooney@diligent.com\n>; Brian Luong <\nbluong@diligent.com\n>\nCc:\n\u00a0Don Reyes <\ndreyes@diligent.com\n>; Karen Lai <\nklai@diligent.com\n>; Kumud Mishra <\nkmishra@diligent.com\n>\nSubject:\n\u00a0RE: Diligent - WO_DELMONTE_COC_080624 - Del Monte CoC\n\u00a0\nHello Randi,\nIm sorry, tomorrow is complicated.

But as shown with our testing, the packages have worked and we'll need their LMS to send us the exact settings that will be needed to accompany Del Monte's method of how they plan to distinguish learners who said Yes or No on the questionnaire.\u00a0\n\u00a0\nPerhaps their system only shows a complete pass/fail scenario? We'd need guidance from their LMS on how scores are captured and if it can distinguish a 50% score that \"fails\" but still passes the course.\u00a0\n\u00a0\nPlease note our so long back and forth comes from their limiting system and as you can notice we are flexible and doing our best to help them get what they need.\nPlease let us know.\nWe are happy to help.\nBest,\nCDS\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\nCatalina De Sanctis\nTranslation Specialist\nLCW\n<image003.png>\n\u00a0\nWebsite\n\u00a0| \nTwitter\n\u00a0| \nFacebook\n\u00a0| \nLinkedIn\nView our upcoming events\n\u00a0| \nSign-up for our newsletter\n\u00a0\nFrom:\n\u00a0Randi Mooney <\nrmooney@diligent.com\n>\nSent:\n\u00a0Thursday, February 20, 2025 1:49 PM\nTo:\n\u00a0Catalina De Sanctis <\nc.desanctis@lcwmail.com\n>\nCc:\n\u00a0Brian Luong <\nbluong@diligent.com\n>; Don Reyes <\ndreyes@diligent.com\n>; Karen Lai <\nklai@diligent.com\n>; Kumud Mishra <\nkmishra@diligent.com\n>; Jorgelina Venturi <\nj.venturi@lcwmail.com\n>\nSubject:\n\u00a0Re: Diligent - WO_DELMONTE_COC_080624 - Del Monte CoC\n\u00a0\nHello,\n\u00a0\nDel Monte will be following up with their LMS on this matter. Also including another \ncomment \nDel Monte provided below:\n\u00a0\nI just sent the question to Convercent but in the screenshot shared, it showed a score of 100 for completion and a blank score for incompletion, so I don't think it is pass/fail score? The issue we have is that we can't distinguish all blank scores that are incomplete, and we don't know if in fact they completed the course. We could even be ok with a blank score if the participant was able to complete the course.\n\u00a0\nThanks,\n_________________________\nDiligent\nRandi Mooney,\n\u00a0she/her\nAdvisory Specialist II, Advisory & Consulting Services\nrmooney@diligent.com\n\u00a0| \ndiligent.com\n\u00a0\nUpcoming PTO: February 20th - February 25th\n\u00a0\nDisclaimer\nThe information contained in this communication from the sender is confidential.

We can adjust the\u00a0package to give them scores or try to adapt to their system of distinguishing learners with such limited LMS reporting features. But as shown with our testing, the packages have worked and we'll need their LMS to send us the exact settings that will be needed to accompany Del Monte's method of how they plan to distinguish learners who said Yes or No on the questionnaire.\u00a0\n\u00a0\nPerhaps their system only shows a complete pass/fail scenario? We'd need guidance from their LMS on how scores are captured and if it can distinguish a 50% score that \"fails\" but still passes the course.\u00a0\n\u00a0\nPlease note our so long back and forth comes from their limiting system and as you can notice we are flexible and doing our best to help them get what they need.\nPlease let us know.\nWe are happy to help.\nBest,\nCDS\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\nCatalina De Sanctis\nTranslation Specialist\nLCW\n<image003.png>\n\u00a0\nWebsite\n\u00a0| \nTwitter\n\u00a0| \nFacebook\n\u00a0| \nLinkedIn\nView our upcoming events\n\u00a0| \nSign-up for our newsletter\n\u00a0\nFrom:\n\u00a0Randi Mooney <\nrmooney@diligent.com\n>\nSent:\n\u00a0Thursday, February 20, 2025 1:49 PM\nTo:\n\u00a0Catalina De Sanctis <\nc.desanctis@lcwmail.com\n>\nCc:\n\u00a0Brian Luong <\nbluong@diligent.com\n>; Don Reyes <\ndreyes@diligent.com\n>; Karen Lai <\nklai@diligent.com\n>; Kumud Mishra <\nkmishra@diligent.com\n>; Jorgelina Venturi <\nj.venturi@lcwmail.com\n>\nSubject:\n\u00a0Re: Diligent - WO_DELMONTE_COC_080624 - Del Monte CoC\n\u00a0\nHello,\n\u00a0\nDel Monte will be following up with their LMS on this matter. Also including another \ncomment \nDel Monte provided below:\n\u00a0\nI just sent the question to Convercent but in the screenshot shared, it showed a score of 100 for completion and a blank score for incompletion, so I don't think it is pass/fail score? The issue we have is that we can't distinguish all blank scores that are incomplete, and we don't know if in fact they completed the course. We could even be ok with a blank score if the participant was able to complete the course.\n\u00a0\nThanks,\n_________________________\nDiligent\nRandi Mooney,\n\u00a0she/her\nAdvisory Specialist II, Advisory & Consulting Services\nrmooney@diligent.com\n\u00a0| \ndiligent.com\n\u00a0\nUpcoming PTO: February 20th - February 25th\n\u00a0\nDisclaimer\nThe information contained in this communication from the sender is confidential.

We can adjust the\u00a0package to give them scores or try to adapt to their system of distinguishing learners with such limited LMS reporting features. But as shown with our testing, the packages have worked and we'll need their LMS to send us the exact settings that will be needed to accompany Del Monte's method of how they plan to distinguish learners who said Yes or No on the questionnaire.\u00a0\n\u00a0\nPerhaps their system only shows a complete pass/fail scenario? We'd need guidance from their LMS on how scores are captured and if it can distinguish a 50% score that \"fails\" but still passes the course.\u00a0\n\u00a0\nPlease note our so long back and forth comes from their limiting system and as you can notice we are flexible and doing our best to help them get what they need.\nPlease let us know.\nWe are happy to help.\nBest,\nCDS\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\nCatalina De Sanctis\nTranslation Specialist\nLCW\n<image003.png>\n\u00a0\nWebsite\n\u00a0| \nTwitter\n\u00a0| \nFacebook\n\u00a0| \nLinkedIn\nView our upcoming events\n\u00a0| \nSign-up for our newsletter\n\u00a0\nFrom:\n\u00a0Randi Mooney <\nrmooney@diligent.com\n>\nSent:\n\u00a0Thursday, February 20, 2025 1:49 PM\nTo:\n\u00a0Catalina De Sanctis <\nc.desanctis@lcwmail.com\n>\nCc:\n\u00a0Brian Luong <\nbluong@diligent.com\n>; Don Reyes <\ndreyes@diligent.com\n>; Karen Lai <\nklai@diligent.com\n>; Kumud Mishra <\nkmishra@diligent.com\n>; Jorgelina Venturi <\nj.venturi@lcwmail.com\n>\nSubject:\n\u00a0Re: Diligent - WO_DELMONTE_COC_080624 - Del Monte CoC\n\u00a0\nHello,\n\u00a0\nDel Monte will be following up with their LMS on this matter.

What does the ETA look like for a testable ENG file with the numerical scores configured?\n\u00a0\nThanks!\n_________________________\nDiligent\nRandi Mooney,\n\u00a0she/her\nAdvisory Specialist II, Advisory & Consulting Services\nrmooney@diligent.com\n\u00a0| \ndiligent.com\n\u00a0\nUpcoming PTO: February 20th - February 25th\n\u00a0\nFrom:\n\u00a0Catalina De Sanctis <\nc.desanctis@lcwmail.com\n>\nSent:\n\u00a0Wednesday, February 12, 2025 2:14 PM\nTo:\n\u00a0Randi Mooney <\nrmooney@diligent.com\n>\nCc:\n\u00a0Brian Luong <\nbluong@diligent.com\n>; Don Reyes <\ndreyes@diligent.com\n>; Karen Lai <\nklai@diligent.com\n>; Kumud Mishra <\nkmishra@diligent.com\n>\nSubject:\n\u00a0RE: Diligent - WO_DELMONTE_COC_080624 - Del Monte CoC\n\u00a0\nEXTERNAL:\n\u00a0This email originated from outside of the organization.

This method involves the least amount of scope increase since we're at the translation phase. See below for what I did to the package to relay to them. Then can use the Menu to skip to the Certification slide to test both clickable decisions.\n\u00a0\n<image019.png>\n\u00a0\nOn the screen below, when the learner selects the No, the course will complete when the final slide loads. If the learner selects Yes, then the course will register as incomplete when reaching the final slide. \nIf this is not enough for them, please have Del Monte describe how they are going to mitigate this issue for themselves internally with the limitations of their LMS, and we can adjust the package accordingly. \nSince their LMS doesn't allow the reportage they want, they need to decide how they are going to reach out to people who appear incomplete if this isn't good enough. That may even need to include adding language to the course that would then need translation. Reconfiguration/Testing of the course for numerical scores to be sent to signal the selected response in question, would take 1hr per language to adjust totaling $1400 ($140*10lg) additional to the scope on my end. The adjustment I did here would only increase the scope between $140-$280 overall to apply the fix.\n<image020.png>\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\nPlease let us know your comments.\nThanks!\nCDS\n\u00a0\nCatalina De Sanctis\nTranslation Specialist\nLCW\n<image021.png>\n\u00a0\nWebsite\n\u00a0| \nTwitter\n\u00a0| \nFacebook\n\u00a0| \nLinkedIn\nView our upcoming events\n\u00a0| \nSign-up for our newsletter\n\u00a0\nFrom:\n\u00a0Randi Mooney <\nrmooney@diligent.com\n>\nSent:\n\u00a0Tuesday, February 11, 2025 2:31 PM\nTo:\n\u00a0Catalina De Sanctis <\nc.desanctis@lcwmail.com\n>\nCc:\n\u00a0Brian Luong <\nbluong@diligent.com\n>; Don Reyes <\ndreyes@diligent.com\n>; Karen Lai <\nklai@diligent.com\n>; Kumud Mishra <\nkmishra@diligent.com\n>\nSubject:\n\u00a0Re: Diligent - WO_DELMONTE_COC_080624 - Del Monte CoC\n\u00a0\nHi Catalina,\n\u00a0\nI wanted to follow up to see if Dustin's new test file for Del Monte is ready?

That is why we decided to proceed with SCORM 2004 as it allows for customized reportage.\nWe have asked Del Monte to confirm with their LMS, Convercent, what type of reports or metadata can be generated or exported. \nAwaiting a response here.\nQuestions to discuss:\nIs there any way to run a report on behalf\u00a0of Del Monte?\nHave reporting capabilities been brought up in the prior year updates for Del Monte? \nIf so, what was the recommendation?\nThanks!\n_________________________\nDiligent\nRandi Mooney (Doran),\n\u00a0she/her\nAdvisory Specialist II, Advisory & Consulting Services\nrmooney@diligent.com\n\u00a0| \ndiligent.com\n\u00a0\nFrom:\n\u00a0Catalina De Sanctis <\nc.desanctis@lcwmail.com\n>\nSent:\n\u00a0Wednesday, January 29, 2025 7:23 PM\nTo:\n\u00a0Randi Mooney <\nrmooney@diligent.com\n>; Brian Luong <\nbluong@diligent.com\n>\nCc:\n\u00a0Don Reyes <\ndreyes@diligent.com\n>; Karen Lai <\nklai@diligent.com\n>; Kumud Mishra <\nkmishra@diligent.com\n>\nSubject:\n\u00a0RE: Diligent - WO_DELMONTE_COC_080624 - Del Monte CoC\n\u00a0\nHello Randi,\nIm sorry, tomorrow is complicated.

We can adjust the\u00a0package to give them scores or try to adapt to their system of distinguishing learners with such limited LMS reporting features. But as shown with our testing, the packages have worked and we'll need their LMS to send us the exact settings that will be needed to accompany Del Monte's method of how they plan to distinguish learners who said Yes or No on the questionnaire.\u00a0\n\u00a0\nPerhaps their system only shows a complete pass/fail scenario? We'd need guidance from their LMS on how scores are captured and if it can distinguish a 50% score that \"fails\" but still passes the course.\u00a0\n\u00a0\nPlease note our so long back and forth comes from their limiting system and as you can notice we are flexible and doing our best to help them get what they need.\nPlease let us know.\nWe are happy to help.\nBest,\nCDS\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\nCatalina De Sanctis\nTranslation Specialist\nLCW\n<image003.png>\n\u00a0\nWebsite\n\u00a0| \nTwitter\n\u00a0| \nFacebook\n\u00a0| \nLinkedIn\nView our upcoming events\n\u00a0| \nSign-up for our newsletter\n\u00a0\nFrom:\n\u00a0Randi Mooney <\nrmooney@diligent.com\n>\nSent:\n\u00a0Thursday, February 20, 2025 1:49 PM\nTo:\n\u00a0Catalina De Sanctis <\nc.desanctis@lcwmail.com\n>\nCc:\n\u00a0Brian Luong <\nbluong@diligent.com\n>; Don Reyes <\ndreyes@diligent.com\n>; Karen Lai <\nklai@diligent.com\n>; Kumud Mishra <\nkmishra@diligent.com\n>; Jorgelina Venturi <\nj.venturi@lcwmail.com\n>\nSubject:\n\u00a0Re: Diligent - WO_DELMONTE_COC_080624 - Del Monte CoC\n\u00a0\nHello,\n\u00a0\nDel Monte will be following up with their LMS on this matter.

The issue we have is that we can't distinguish all blank scores that are incomplete, and we don't know if in fact they completed the course. We could even be ok with a blank score if the participant was able to complete the course.\n\u00a0\nThanks,\n_________________________\nDiligent\nRandi Mooney,\n\u00a0she/her\nAdvisory Specialist II, Advisory & Consulting Services\nrmooney@diligent.com\n\u00a0| \ndiligent.com\n\u00a0\nUpcoming PTO: February 20th - February 25th\n\u00a0\nDisclaimer\nThe information contained in this communication from the sender is confidential.

We can adjust the\u00a0package to give them scores or try to adapt to their system of distinguishing learners with such limited LMS reporting features. But as shown with our testing, the packages have worked and we'll need their LMS to send us the exact settings that will be needed to accompany Del Monte's method of how they plan to distinguish learners who said Yes or No on the questionnaire.\u00a0\n\u00a0\nPerhaps their system only shows a complete pass/fail scenario? We'd need guidance from their LMS on how scores are captured and if it can distinguish a 50% score that \"fails\" but still passes the course.\u00a0\n\u00a0\nPlease note our so long back and forth comes from their limiting system and as you can notice we are flexible and doing our best to help them get what they need.\nPlease let us know.\nWe are happy to help.\nBest,\nCDS\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\nCatalina De Sanctis\nTranslation Specialist\nLCW\n<image003.png>\n\u00a0\nWebsite\n\u00a0| \nTwitter\n\u00a0| \nFacebook\n\u00a0| \nLinkedIn\nView our upcoming events\n\u00a0| \nSign-up for our newsletter\n\u00a0\nFrom:\n\u00a0Randi Mooney <\nrmooney@diligent.com\n>\nSent:\n\u00a0Thursday, February 20, 2025 1:49 PM\nTo:\n\u00a0Catalina De Sanctis <\nc.desanctis@lcwmail.com\n>\nCc:\n\u00a0Brian Luong <\nbluong@diligent.com\n>; Don Reyes <\ndreyes@diligent.com\n>; Karen Lai <\nklai@diligent.com\n>; Kumud Mishra <\nkmishra@diligent.com\n>; Jorgelina Venturi <\nj.venturi@lcwmail.com\n>\nSubject:\n\u00a0Re: Diligent - WO_DELMONTE_COC_080624 - Del Monte CoC\n\u00a0\nHello,\n\u00a0\nDel Monte will be following up with their LMS on this matter.

This method involves the least amount of scope increase since we're at the translation phase. See below for what I did to the package to relay to them. Then can use the Menu to skip to the Certification slide to test both clickable decisions.\n\u00a0\n<image019.png>\n\u00a0\nOn the screen below, when the learner selects the No, the course will complete when the final slide loads. If the learner selects Yes, then the course will register as incomplete when reaching the final slide. \nIf this is not enough for them, please have Del Monte describe how they are going to mitigate this issue for themselves internally with the limitations of their LMS, and we can adjust the package accordingly. \nSince their LMS doesn't allow the reportage they want, they need to decide how they are going to reach out to people who appear incomplete if this isn't good enough. That may even need to include adding language to the course that would then need translation. Reconfiguration/Testing of the course for numerical scores to be sent to signal the selected response in question, would take 1hr per language to adjust totaling $1400 ($140*10lg) additional to the scope on my end. The adjustment I did here would only increase the scope between $140-$280 overall to apply the fix.\n<image020.png>\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\nPlease let us know your comments.\nThanks!\nCDS\n\u00a0\nCatalina De Sanctis\nTranslation Specialist\nLCW\n<image021.png>\n\u00a0\nWebsite\n\u00a0| \nTwitter\n\u00a0| \nFacebook\n\u00a0| \nLinkedIn\nView our upcoming events\n\u00a0| \nSign-up for our newsletter\n\u00a0\nFrom:\n\u00a0Randi Mooney <\nrmooney@diligent.com\n>\nSent:\n\u00a0Tuesday, February 11, 2025 2:31 PM\nTo:\n\u00a0Catalina De Sanctis <\nc.desanctis@lcwmail.com\n>\nCc:\n\u00a0Brian Luong <\nbluong@diligent.com\n>; Don Reyes <\ndreyes@diligent.com\n>; Karen Lai <\nklai@diligent.com\n>; Kumud Mishra <\nkmishra@diligent.com\n>\nSubject:\n\u00a0Re: Diligent - WO_DELMONTE_COC_080624 - Del Monte CoC\n\u00a0\nHi Catalina,\n\u00a0\nI wanted to follow up to see if Dustin's new test file for Del Monte is ready?

But in the meantime, sent over an invite for Friday.\n\u00a0\nHere is a summary of the situation:\nDel Monte noted earlier this week that the SCORM 2004 test file worked well in their LMS but followed up asking if we could send them their test report.\nWe informed them that without explicit access to their LMS and metadata, it would not be possible to generate a report on their behalf.\nThey replied that their LMS does not allow for any reports to be exported. This is where the misunderstanding occurred.\nEarlier in the project, it was interpreted that they were not getting the desired information from SCORM 1.2 completion reports. That is why we decided to proceed with SCORM 2004 as it allows for customized reportage.\nWe have asked Del Monte to confirm with their LMS, Convercent, what type of reports or metadata can be generated or exported. Awaiting a response here.\nQuestions to discuss:\nIs there any way to run a report on behalf\u00a0of Del Monte?\nHave reporting capabilities been brought up in the prior year updates for Del Monte? If so, what was the recommendation?\nThanks!\n_________________________\nDiligent\nRandi Mooney (Doran),\n\u00a0she/her\nAdvisory Specialist II, Advisory & Consulting Services\nrmooney@diligent.com\n\u00a0| \ndiligent.com\n\u00a0\nFrom:\n\u00a0Catalina De Sanctis <\nc.desanctis@lcwmail.com\n>\nSent:\n\u00a0Wednesday, January 29, 2025 7:23 PM\nTo:\n\u00a0Randi Mooney <\nrmooney@diligent.com\n>; Brian Luong <\nbluong@diligent.com\n>\nCc:\n\u00a0Don Reyes <\ndreyes@diligent.com\n>; Karen Lai <\nklai@diligent.com\n>; Kumud Mishra <\nkmishra@diligent.com\n>\nSubject:\n\u00a0RE: Diligent - WO_DELMONTE_COC_080624 - Del Monte CoC\n\u00a0\nHello Randi,\nIm sorry, tomorrow is complicated.

We can adjust the\u00a0package to give them scores or try to adapt to their system of distinguishing learners with such limited LMS reporting features. But as shown with our testing, the packages have worked and we'll need their LMS to send us the exact settings that will be needed to accompany Del Monte's method of how they plan to distinguish learners who said Yes or No on the questionnaire.\u00a0\n\u00a0\nPerhaps their system only shows a complete pass/fail scenario? We'd need guidance from their LMS on how scores are captured and if it can distinguish a 50% score that \"fails\" but still passes the course.\u00a0\n\u00a0\nPlease note our so long back and forth comes from their limiting system and as you can notice we are flexible and doing our best to help them get what they need.\nPlease let us know.\nWe are happy to help.\nBest,\nCDS\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\nCatalina De Sanctis\nTranslation Specialist\nLCW\n<image003.png>\n\u00a0\nWebsite\n\u00a0| \nTwitter\n\u00a0| \nFacebook\n\u00a0| \nLinkedIn\nView our upcoming events\n\u00a0| \nSign-up for our newsletter\n\u00a0\nFrom:\n\u00a0Randi Mooney <\nrmooney@diligent.com\n>\nSent:\n\u00a0Thursday, February 20, 2025 1:49 PM\nTo:\n\u00a0Catalina De Sanctis <\nc.desanctis@lcwmail.com\n>\nCc:\n\u00a0Brian Luong <\nbluong@diligent.com\n>; Don Reyes <\ndreyes@diligent.com\n>; Karen Lai <\nklai@diligent.com\n>; Kumud Mishra <\nkmishra@diligent.com\n>; Jorgelina Venturi <\nj.venturi@lcwmail.com\n>\nSubject:\n\u00a0Re: Diligent - WO_DELMONTE_COC_080624 - Del Monte CoC\n\u00a0\nHello,\n\u00a0\nDel Monte will be following up with their LMS on this matter.

The issue we have is that we can't distinguish all blank scores that are incomplete, and we don't know if in fact they completed the course.

This method involves the least amount of scope increase since we're at the translation phase. See below for what I did to the package to relay to them. Then can use the Menu to skip to the Certification slide to test both clickable decisions.\n\u00a0\n<image019.png>\n\u00a0\nOn the screen below, when the learner selects the No, the course will complete when the final slide loads. If the learner selects Yes, then the course will register as incomplete when reaching the final slide. \nIf this is not enough for them, please have Del Monte describe how they are going to mitigate this issue for themselves internally with the limitations of their LMS, and we can adjust the package accordingly. \nSince their LMS doesn't allow the reportage they want, they need to decide how they are going to reach out to people who appear incomplete if this isn't good enough. That may even need to include adding language to the course that would then need translation. Reconfiguration/Testing of the course for numerical scores to be sent to signal the selected response in question, would take 1hr per language to adjust totaling $1400 ($140*10lg) additional to the scope on my end. The adjustment I did here would only increase the scope between $140-$280 overall to apply the fix.\n<image020.png>\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\nPlease let us know your comments.\nThanks!\nCDS\n\u00a0\nCatalina De Sanctis\nTranslation Specialist\nLCW\n<image021.png>\n\u00a0\nWebsite\n\u00a0| \nTwitter\n\u00a0| \nFacebook\n\u00a0| \nLinkedIn\nView our upcoming events\n\u00a0| \nSign-up for our newsletter\n\u00a0\nFrom:\n\u00a0Randi Mooney <\nrmooney@diligent.com\n>\nSent:\n\u00a0Tuesday, February 11, 2025 2:31 PM\nTo:\n\u00a0Catalina De Sanctis <\nc.desanctis@lcwmail.com\n>\nCc:\n\u00a0Brian Luong <\nbluong@diligent.com\n>; Don Reyes <\ndreyes@diligent.com\n>; Karen Lai <\nklai@diligent.com\n>; Kumud Mishra <\nkmishra@diligent.com\n>\nSubject:\n\u00a0Re: Diligent - WO_DELMONTE_COC_080624 - Del Monte CoC\n\u00a0\nHi Catalina,\n\u00a0\nI wanted to follow up to see if Dustin's new test file for Del Monte is ready?

But in the meantime, sent over an invite for Friday.\n\u00a0\nHere is a summary of the situation:\nDel Monte noted earlier this week that the SCORM 2004 test file worked well in their LMS but followed up asking if we could send them their test report.\nWe informed them that without explicit access to their LMS and metadata, it would not be possible to generate a report on their behalf.\nThey replied that their LMS does not allow for any reports to be exported. This is where the misunderstanding occurred.\nEarlier in the project, it was interpreted that they were not getting the desired information from SCORM 1.2 completion reports. That is why we decided to proceed with SCORM 2004 as it allows for customized reportage.\nWe have asked Del Monte to confirm with their LMS, Convercent, what type of reports or metadata can be generated or exported. Awaiting a response here.\nQuestions to discuss:\nIs there any way to run a report on behalf\u00a0of Del Monte?\nHave reporting capabilities been brought up in the prior year updates for Del Monte? If so, what was the recommendation?\nThanks!\n_________________________\nDiligent\nRandi Mooney (Doran),\n\u00a0she/her\nAdvisory Specialist II, Advisory & Consulting Services\nrmooney@diligent.com\n\u00a0| \ndiligent.com\n\u00a0\nFrom:\n\u00a0Catalina De Sanctis <\nc.desanctis@lcwmail.com\n>\nSent:\n\u00a0Wednesday, January 29, 2025 7:23 PM\nTo:\n\u00a0Randi Mooney <\nrmooney@diligent.com\n>; Brian Luong <\nbluong@diligent.com\n>\nCc:\n\u00a0Don Reyes <\ndreyes@diligent.com\n>; Karen Lai <\nklai@diligent.com\n>; Kumud Mishra <\nkmishra@diligent.com\n>\nSubject:\n\u00a0RE: Diligent - WO_DELMONTE_COC_080624 - Del Monte CoC\n\u00a0\nHello Randi,\nIm sorry, tomorrow is complicated.

We can adjust the\u00a0package to give them scores or try to adapt to their system of distinguishing learners with such limited LMS reporting features. But as shown with our testing, the packages have worked and we'll need their LMS to send us the exact settings that will be needed to accompany Del Monte's method of how they plan to distinguish learners who said Yes or No on the questionnaire.\u00a0\n\u00a0\nPerhaps their system only shows a complete pass/fail scenario? We'd need guidance from their LMS on how scores are captured and if it can distinguish a 50% score that \"fails\" but still passes the course.\u00a0\n\u00a0\nPlease note our so long back and forth comes from their limiting system and as you can notice we are flexible and doing our best to help them get what they need.\nPlease let us know.\nWe are happy to help.\nBest,\nCDS\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\nCatalina De Sanctis\nTranslation Specialist\nLCW\n<image003.png>\n\u00a0\nWebsite\n\u00a0| \nTwitter\n\u00a0| \nFacebook\n\u00a0| \nLinkedIn\nView our upcoming events\n\u00a0| \nSign-up for our newsletter\n\u00a0\nFrom:\n\u00a0Randi Mooney <\nrmooney@diligent.com\n>\nSent:\n\u00a0Thursday, February 20, 2025 1:49 PM\nTo:\n\u00a0Catalina De Sanctis <\nc.desanctis@lcwmail.com\n>\nCc:\n\u00a0Brian Luong <\nbluong@diligent.com\n>; Don Reyes <\ndreyes@diligent.com\n>; Karen Lai <\nklai@diligent.com\n>; Kumud Mishra <\nkmishra@diligent.com\n>; Jorgelina Venturi <\nj.venturi@lcwmail.com\n>\nSubject:\n\u00a0Re: Diligent - WO_DELMONTE_COC_080624 - Del Monte CoC\n\u00a0\nHello,\n\u00a0\nDel Monte will be following up with their LMS on this matter.

This method involves the least amount of scope increase since we're at the translation phase. See below for what I did to the package to relay to them. Then can use the Menu to skip to the Certification slide to test both clickable decisions.\n\u00a0\n<image019.png>\n\u00a0\nOn the screen below, when the learner selects the No, the course will complete when the final slide loads. If the learner selects Yes, then the course will register as incomplete when reaching the final slide. \nIf this is not enough for them, please have Del Monte describe how they are going to mitigate this issue for themselves internally with the limitations of their LMS, and we can adjust the package accordingly. \nSince their LMS doesn't allow the reportage they want, they need to decide how they are going to reach out to people who appear incomplete if this isn't good enough. That may even need to include adding language to the course that would then need translation. Reconfiguration/Testing of the course for numerical scores to be sent to signal the selected response in question, would take 1hr per language to adjust totaling $1400 ($140*10lg) additional to the scope on my end. The adjustment I did here would only increase the scope between $140-$280 overall to apply the fix.\n<image020.png>\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\nPlease let us know your comments.\nThanks!\nCDS\n\u00a0\nCatalina De Sanctis\nTranslation Specialist\nLCW\n<image021.png>\n\u00a0\nWebsite\n\u00a0| \nTwitter\n\u00a0| \nFacebook\n\u00a0| \nLinkedIn\nView our upcoming events\n\u00a0| \nSign-up for our newsletter\n\u00a0\nFrom:\n\u00a0Randi Mooney <\nrmooney@diligent.com\n>\nSent:\n\u00a0Tuesday, February 11, 2025 2:31 PM\nTo:\n\u00a0Catalina De Sanctis <\nc.desanctis@lcwmail.com\n>\nCc:\n\u00a0Brian Luong <\nbluong@diligent.com\n>; Don Reyes <\ndreyes@diligent.com\n>; Karen Lai <\nklai@diligent.com\n>; Kumud Mishra <\nkmishra@diligent.com\n>\nSubject:\n\u00a0Re: Diligent - WO_DELMONTE_COC_080624 - Del Monte CoC\n\u00a0\nHi Catalina,\n\u00a0\nI wanted to follow up to see if Dustin's new test file for Del Monte is ready?

But in the meantime, sent over an invite for Friday.\n\u00a0\nHere is a summary of the situation:\nDel Monte noted earlier this week that the SCORM 2004 test file worked well in their LMS but followed up asking if we could send them their test report.\nWe informed them that without explicit access to their LMS and metadata, it would not be possible to generate a report on their behalf.\nThey replied that their LMS does not allow for any reports to be exported. This is where the misunderstanding occurred.\nEarlier in the project, it was interpreted that they were not getting the desired information from SCORM 1.2 completion reports. That is why we decided to proceed with SCORM 2004 as it allows for customized reportage.\nWe have asked Del Monte to confirm with their LMS, Convercent, what type of reports or metadata can be generated or exported. Awaiting a response here.\nQuestions to discuss:\nIs there any way to run a report on behalf\u00a0of Del Monte?\nHave reporting capabilities been brought up in the prior year updates for Del Monte? If so, what was the recommendation?\nThanks!\n_________________________\nDiligent\nRandi Mooney (Doran),\n\u00a0she/her\nAdvisory Specialist II, Advisory & Consulting Services\nrmooney@diligent.com\n\u00a0| \ndiligent.com\n\u00a0\nFrom:\n\u00a0Catalina De Sanctis <\nc.desanctis@lcwmail.com\n>\nSent:\n\u00a0Wednesday, January 29, 2025 7:23 PM\nTo:\n\u00a0Randi Mooney <\nrmooney@diligent.com\n>; Brian Luong <\nbluong@diligent.com\n>\nCc:\n\u00a0Don Reyes <\ndreyes@diligent.com\n>; Karen Lai <\nklai@diligent.com\n>; Kumud Mishra <\nkmishra@diligent.com\n>\nSubject:\n\u00a0RE: Diligent - WO_DELMONTE_COC_080624 - Del Monte CoC\n\u00a0\nHello Randi,\nIm sorry, tomorrow is complicated.

We can adjust the\u00a0package to give them scores or try to adapt to their system of distinguishing learners with such limited LMS reporting features. But as shown with our testing, the packages have worked and we'll need their LMS to send us the exact settings that will be needed to accompany Del Monte's method of how they plan to distinguish learners who said Yes or No on the questionnaire.\u00a0\n\u00a0\nPerhaps their system only shows a complete pass/fail scenario? We'd need guidance from their LMS on how scores are captured and if it can distinguish a 50% score that \"fails\" but still passes the course.\u00a0\n\u00a0\nPlease note our so long back and forth comes from their limiting system and as you can notice we are flexible and doing our best to help them get what they need.\nPlease let us know.\nWe are happy to help.\nBest,\nCDS\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\nCatalina De Sanctis\nTranslation Specialist\nLCW\n<image003.png>\n\u00a0\nWebsite\n\u00a0| \nTwitter\n\u00a0| \nFacebook\n\u00a0| \nLinkedIn\nView our upcoming events\n\u00a0| \nSign-up for our newsletter\n\u00a0\nFrom:\n\u00a0Randi Mooney <\nrmooney@diligent.com\n>\nSent:\n\u00a0Thursday, February 20, 2025 1:49 PM\nTo:\n\u00a0Catalina De Sanctis <\nc.desanctis@lcwmail.com\n>\nCc:\n\u00a0Brian Luong <\nbluong@diligent.com\n>; Don Reyes <\ndreyes@diligent.com\n>; Karen Lai <\nklai@diligent.com\n>; Kumud Mishra <\nkmishra@diligent.com\n>; Jorgelina Venturi <\nj.venturi@lcwmail.com\n>\nSubject:\n\u00a0Re: Diligent - WO_DELMONTE_COC_080624 - Del Monte CoC\n\u00a0\nHello,\n\u00a0\nDel Monte will be following up with their LMS on this matter.

The issue we have is that we can't distinguish all blank scores that are incomplete, and we don't know if in fact they completed the course. We could even be ok with a blank score if the participant was able to complete the course.\n\u00a0\nThanks,\n_________________________\nDiligent\nRandi Mooney,\n\u00a0she/her\nAdvisory Specialist II, Advisory & Consulting Services\nrmooney@diligent.com\n\u00a0| \ndiligent.com\n\u00a0\nUpcoming PTO: February 20th - February 25th\n\u00a0\nDisclaimer\nThe information contained in this communication from the sender is confidential.

We can adjust the\u00a0package to give them scores or try to adapt to their system of distinguishing learners with such limited LMS reporting features. But as shown with our testing, the packages have worked and we'll need their LMS to send us the exact settings that will be needed to accompany Del Monte's method of how they plan to distinguish learners who said Yes or No on the questionnaire.\u00a0\n\u00a0\nPerhaps their system only shows a complete pass/fail scenario? We'd need guidance from their LMS on how scores are captured and if it can distinguish a 50% score that \"fails\" but still passes the course.\u00a0\n\u00a0\nPlease note our so long back and forth comes from their limiting system and as you can notice we are flexible and doing our best to help them get what they need.\nPlease let us know.\nWe are happy to help.\nBest,\nCDS\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\nCatalina De Sanctis\nTranslation Specialist\nLCW\n<image003.png>\n\u00a0\nWebsite\n\u00a0| \nTwitter\n\u00a0| \nFacebook\n\u00a0| \nLinkedIn\nView our upcoming events\n\u00a0| \nSign-up for our newsletter\n\u00a0\nFrom:\n\u00a0Randi Mooney <\nrmooney@diligent.com\n>\nSent:\n\u00a0Thursday, February 20, 2025 1:49 PM\nTo:\n\u00a0Catalina De Sanctis <\nc.desanctis@lcwmail.com\n>\nCc:\n\u00a0Brian Luong <\nbluong@diligent.com\n>; Don Reyes <\ndreyes@diligent.com\n>; Karen Lai <\nklai@diligent.com\n>; Kumud Mishra <\nkmishra@diligent.com\n>; Jorgelina Venturi <\nj.venturi@lcwmail.com\n>\nSubject:\n\u00a0Re: Diligent - WO_DELMONTE_COC_080624 - Del Monte CoC\n\u00a0\nHello,\n\u00a0\nDel Monte will be following up with their LMS on this matter. Also including another \ncomment \nDel Monte provided below:\n\u00a0\nI just sent the question to Convercent but in the screenshot shared, it showed a score of 100 for completion and a blank score for incompletion, so I don't think it is pass/fail score? The issue we have is that we can't distinguish all blank scores that are incomplete, and we don't know if in fact they completed the course. We could even be ok with a blank score if the participant was able to complete the course.\n\u00a0\nThanks,\n_________________________\nDiligent\nRandi Mooney,\n\u00a0she/her\nAdvisory Specialist II, Advisory & Consulting Services\nrmooney@diligent.com\n\u00a0| \ndiligent.com\n\u00a0\nUpcoming PTO: February 20th - February 25th\n\u00a0\nDisclaimer\nThe information contained in this communication from the sender is confidential.

We can adjust the\u00a0package to give them scores or try to adapt to their system of distinguishing learners with such limited LMS reporting features. But as shown with our testing, the packages have worked and we'll need their LMS to send us the exact settings that will be needed to accompany Del Monte's method of how they plan to distinguish learners who said Yes or No on the questionnaire.\u00a0\n\u00a0\nPerhaps their system only shows a complete pass/fail scenario? We'd need guidance from their LMS on how scores are captured and if it can distinguish a 50% score that \"fails\" but still passes the course.\u00a0\n\u00a0\nPlease note our so long back and forth comes from their limiting system and as you can notice we are flexible and doing our best to help them get what they need.\nPlease let us know.\nWe are happy to help.\nBest,\nCDS\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\nCatalina De Sanctis\nTranslation Specialist\nLCW\n<image003.png>\n\u00a0\nWebsite\n\u00a0| \nTwitter\n\u00a0| \nFacebook\n\u00a0| \nLinkedIn\nView our upcoming events\n\u00a0| \nSign-up for our newsletter\n\u00a0\nFrom:\n\u00a0Randi Mooney <\nrmooney@diligent.com\n>\nSent:\n\u00a0Thursday, February 20, 2025 1:49 PM\nTo:\n\u00a0Catalina De Sanctis <\nc.desanctis@lcwmail.com\n>\nCc:\n\u00a0Brian Luong <\nbluong@diligent.com\n>; Don Reyes <\ndreyes@diligent.com\n>; Karen Lai <\nklai@diligent.com\n>; Kumud Mishra <\nkmishra@diligent.com\n>; Jorgelina Venturi <\nj.venturi@lcwmail.com\n>\nSubject:\n\u00a0Re: Diligent - WO_DELMONTE_COC_080624 - Del Monte CoC\n\u00a0\nHello,\n\u00a0\nDel Monte will be following up with their LMS on this matter. Also including another \ncomment \nDel Monte provided below:\n\u00a0\nI just sent the question to Convercent but in the screenshot shared, it showed a score of 100 for completion and a blank score for incompletion, so I don't think it is pass/fail score? The issue we have is that we can't distinguish all blank scores that are incomplete, and we don't know if in fact they completed the course. We could even be ok with a blank score if the participant was able to complete the course.\n\u00a0\nThanks,\n_________________________\nDiligent\nRandi Mooney,\n\u00a0she/her\nAdvisory Specialist II, Advisory & Consulting Services\nrmooney@diligent.com\n\u00a0| \ndiligent.com\n\u00a0\nUpcoming PTO: February 20th - February 25th",

We can adjust the\u00a0package to give them scores or try to adapt to their system of distinguishing learners with such limited LMS reporting features. But as shown with our testing, the packages have worked and we'll need their LMS to send us the exact settings that will be needed to accompany Del Monte's method of how they plan to distinguish learners who said Yes or No on the questionnaire.\u00a0\n\u00a0\nPerhaps their system only shows a complete pass/fail scenario? We'd need guidance from their LMS on how scores are captured and if it can distinguish a 50% score that \"fails\" but still passes the course.\u00a0\n\u00a0\nPlease note our so long back and forth comes from their limiting system and as you can notice we are flexible and doing our best to help them get what they need.\nPlease let us know.\nWe are happy to help.\nBest,\nCDS\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\nCatalina De Sanctis\nTranslation Specialist\nLCW\n<image003.png>\n\u00a0\nWebsite\n\u00a0| \nTwitter\n\u00a0| \nFacebook\n\u00a0| \nLinkedIn\nView our upcoming events\n\u00a0| \nSign-up for our newsletter\n\u00a0\nFrom:\n\u00a0Randi Mooney <\nrmooney@diligent.com\n>\nSent:\n\u00a0Thursday, February 20, 2025 1:49 PM\nTo:\n\u00a0Catalina De Sanctis <\nc.desanctis@lcwmail.com\n>\nCc:\n\u00a0Brian Luong <\nbluong@diligent.com\n>; Don Reyes <\ndreyes@diligent.com\n>; Karen Lai <\nklai@diligent.com\n>; Kumud Mishra <\nkmishra@diligent.com\n>; Jorgelina Venturi <\nj.venturi@lcwmail.com\n>\nSubject:\n\u00a0Re: Diligent - WO_DELMONTE_COC_080624 - Del Monte CoC\n\u00a0\nHello,\n\u00a0\nDel Monte will be following up with their LMS on this matter. Also including another \ncomment \nDel Monte provided below:\n\u00a0\nI just sent the question to Convercent but in the screenshot shared, it showed a score of 100 for completion and a blank score for incompletion, so I don't think it is pass/fail score? The issue we have is that we can't distinguish all blank scores that are incomplete, and we don't know if in fact they completed the course. We could even be ok with a blank score if the participant was able to complete the course.\n\u00a0\nThanks,\n_________________________\nDiligent\nRandi Mooney,\n\u00a0she/her\nAdvisory Specialist II, Advisory & Consulting Services\nrmooney@diligent.com\n\u00a0| \ndiligent.com\n\u00a0\nUpcoming PTO: February 20th - February 25th",

We can adjust the\u00a0package to give them scores or try to adapt to their system of distinguishing learners with such limited LMS reporting features. But as shown with our testing, the packages have worked and we'll need their LMS to send us the exact settings that will be needed to accompany Del Monte's method of how they plan to distinguish learners who said Yes or No on the questionnaire.\u00a0\n\u00a0\nPerhaps their system only shows a complete pass/fail scenario? We'd need guidance from their LMS on how scores are captured and if it can distinguish a 50% score that \"fails\" but still passes the course.\u00a0\n\u00a0\nPlease note our so long back and forth comes from their limiting system and as you can notice we are flexible and doing our best to help them get what they need.\nPlease let us know.\nWe are happy to help.\nBest,\nCDS\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\nCatalina De Sanctis\nTranslation Specialist\nLCW\n<image003.png>\n\u00a0\nWebsite\n\u00a0| \nTwitter\n\u00a0| \nFacebook\n\u00a0| \nLinkedIn\nView our upcoming events\n\u00a0| \nSign-up for our newsletter\n\u00a0\nFrom:\n\u00a0Randi Mooney <\nrmooney@diligent.com\n>\nSent:\n\u00a0Thursday, February 20, 2025 1:49 PM\nTo:\n\u00a0Catalina De Sanctis <\nc.desanctis@lcwmail.com\n>\nCc:\n\u00a0Brian Luong <\nbluong@diligent.com\n>; Don Reyes <\ndreyes@diligent.com\n>; Karen Lai <\nklai@diligent.com\n>; Kumud Mishra <\nkmishra@diligent.com\n>; Jorgelina Venturi <\nj.venturi@lcwmail.com\n>\nSubject:\n\u00a0Re: Diligent - WO_DELMONTE_COC_080624 - Del Monte CoC\n\u00a0\nHello,\n\u00a0\nDel Monte will be following up with their LMS on this matter. Also including another \ncomment \nDel Monte provided below:\n\u00a0\nI just sent the question to Convercent but in the screenshot shared, it showed a score of 100 for completion and a blank score for incompletion, so I don't think it is pass/fail score? The issue we have is that we can't distinguish all blank scores that are incomplete, and we don't know if in fact they completed the course. We could even be ok with a blank score if the participant was able to complete the course.\n\u00a0\nThanks,\n_________________________\nDiligent\nRandi Mooney,\n\u00a0she/her\nAdvisory Specialist II, Advisory & Consulting Services\nrmooney@diligent.com\n\u00a0| \ndiligent.com\n\u00a0\nUpcoming PTO: February 20th - February 25th",

We can adjust the\u00a0package to give them scores or try to adapt to their system of distinguishing learners with such limited LMS reporting features. But as shown with our testing, the packages have worked and we'll need their LMS to send us the exact settings that will be needed to accompany Del Monte's method of how they plan to distinguish learners who said Yes or No on the questionnaire.\u00a0\n\u00a0\nPerhaps their system only shows a complete pass/fail scenario? We'd need guidance from their LMS on how scores are captured and if it can distinguish a 50% score that \"fails\" but still passes the course.\u00a0\n\u00a0\nPlease note our so long back and forth comes from their limiting system and as you can notice we are flexible and doing our best to help them get what they need.\nPlease let us know.\nWe are happy to help.\nBest,\nCDS\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\nCatalina De Sanctis\nTranslation Specialist\nLCW\n<image003.png>\n\u00a0\nWebsite\n\u00a0| \nTwitter\n\u00a0| \nFacebook\n\u00a0| \nLinkedIn\nView our upcoming events\n\u00a0| \nSign-up for our newsletter\n\u00a0\nFrom:\n\u00a0Randi Mooney <\nrmooney@diligent.com\n>\nSent:\n\u00a0Thursday, February 20, 2025 1:49 PM\nTo:\n\u00a0Catalina De Sanctis <\nc.desanctis@lcwmail.com\n>\nCc:\n\u00a0Brian Luong <\nbluong@diligent.com\n>; Don Reyes <\ndreyes@diligent.com\n>; Karen Lai <\nklai@diligent.com\n>; Kumud Mishra <\nkmishra@diligent.com\n>; Jorgelina Venturi <\nj.venturi@lcwmail.com\n>\nSubject:\n\u00a0Re: Diligent - WO_DELMONTE_COC_080624 - Del Monte CoC\n\u00a0\nHello,\n\u00a0\nDel Monte will be following up with their LMS on this matter.

This method involves the least amount of scope increase since we're at the translation phase. See below for what I did to the package to relay to them. Then can use the Menu to skip to the Certification slide to test both clickable decisions.\n\u00a0\n<image019.png>\n\u00a0\nOn the screen below, when the learner selects the No, the course will complete when the final slide loads. If the learner selects Yes, then the course will register as incomplete when reaching the final slide. \nIf this is not enough for them, please have Del Monte describe how they are going to mitigate this issue for themselves internally with the limitations of their LMS, and we can adjust the package accordingly. \nSince their LMS doesn't allow the reportage they want, they need to decide how they are going to reach out to people who appear incomplete if this isn't good enough. That may even need to include adding language to the course that would then need translation. Reconfiguration/Testing of the course for numerical scores to be sent to signal the selected response in question, would take 1hr per language to adjust totaling $1400 ($140*10lg) additional to the scope on my end. The adjustment I did here would only increase the scope between $140-$280 overall to apply the fix.\n<image020.png>\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\nPlease let us know your comments.\nThanks!\nCDS\n\u00a0\nCatalina De Sanctis\nTranslation Specialist\nLCW\n<image021.png>\n\u00a0\nWebsite\n\u00a0| \nTwitter\n\u00a0| \nFacebook\n\u00a0| \nLinkedIn\nView our upcoming events\n\u00a0| \nSign-up for our newsletter\n\u00a0\nFrom:\n\u00a0Randi Mooney <\nrmooney@diligent.com\n>\nSent:\n\u00a0Tuesday, February 11, 2025 2:31 PM\nTo:\n\u00a0Catalina De Sanctis <\nc.desanctis@lcwmail.com\n>\nCc:\n\u00a0Brian Luong <\nbluong@diligent.com\n>; Don Reyes <\ndreyes@diligent.com\n>; Karen Lai <\nklai@diligent.com\n>; Kumud Mishra <\nkmishra@diligent.com\n>\nSubject:\n\u00a0Re: Diligent - WO_DELMONTE_COC_080624 - Del Monte CoC\n\u00a0\nHi Catalina,\n\u00a0\nI wanted to follow up to see if Dustin's new test file for Del Monte is ready?

But in the meantime, sent over an invite for Friday.\n\u00a0\nHere is a summary of the situation:\nDel Monte noted earlier this week that the SCORM 2004 test file worked well in their LMS but followed up asking if we could send them their test report.\nWe informed them that without explicit access to their LMS and metadata, it would not be possible to generate a report on their behalf.\nThey replied that their LMS does not allow for any reports to be exported. This is where the misunderstanding occurred.\nEarlier in the project, it was interpreted that they were not getting the desired information from SCORM 1.2 completion reports. That is why we decided to proceed with SCORM 2004 as it allows for customized reportage.\nWe have asked Del Monte to confirm with their LMS, Convercent, what type of reports or metadata can be generated or exported. Awaiting a response here.\nQuestions to discuss:\nIs there any way to run a report on behalf\u00a0of Del Monte?\nHave reporting capabilities been brought up in the prior year updates for Del Monte? If so, what was the recommendation?\nThanks!\n_________________________\nDiligent\nRandi Mooney (Doran),\n\u00a0she/her\nAdvisory Specialist II, Advisory & Consulting Services\nrmooney@diligent.com\n\u00a0| \ndiligent.com\n\u00a0\nFrom:\n\u00a0Catalina De Sanctis <\nc.desanctis@lcwmail.com\n>\nSent:\n\u00a0Wednesday, January 29, 2025 7:23 PM\nTo:\n\u00a0Randi Mooney <\nrmooney@diligent.com\n>; Brian Luong <\nbluong@diligent.com\n>\nCc:\n\u00a0Don Reyes <\ndreyes@diligent.com\n>; Karen Lai <\nklai@diligent.com\n>; Kumud Mishra <\nkmishra@diligent.com\n>\nSubject:\n\u00a0RE: Diligent - WO_DELMONTE_COC_080624 - Del Monte CoC\n\u00a0\nHello Randi,\nIm sorry, tomorrow is complicated.

We can adjust the\u00a0package to give them scores or try to adapt to their system of distinguishing learners with such limited LMS reporting features. But as shown with our testing, the packages have worked and we'll need their LMS to send us the exact settings that will be needed to accompany Del Monte's method of how they plan to distinguish learners who said Yes or No on the questionnaire.\u00a0\n\u00a0\nPerhaps their system only shows a complete pass/fail scenario? We'd need guidance from their LMS on how scores are captured and if it can distinguish a 50% score that \"fails\" but still passes the course.\u00a0\n\u00a0\nPlease note our so long back and forth comes from their limiting system and as you can notice we are flexible and doing our best to help them get what they need.\nPlease let us know.\nWe are happy to help.\nBest,\nCDS\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\nCatalina De Sanctis\nTranslation Specialist\nLCW\n<image003.png>\n\u00a0\nWebsite\n\u00a0| \nTwitter\n\u00a0| \nFacebook\n\u00a0| \nLinkedIn\nView our upcoming events\n\u00a0| \nSign-up for our newsletter\n\u00a0\nFrom:\n\u00a0Randi Mooney <\nrmooney@diligent.com\n>\nSent:\n\u00a0Thursday, February 20, 2025 1:49 PM\nTo:\n\u00a0Catalina De Sanctis <\nc.desanctis@lcwmail.com\n>\nCc:\n\u00a0Brian Luong <\nbluong@diligent.com\n>; Don Reyes <\ndreyes@diligent.com\n>; Karen Lai <\nklai@diligent.com\n>; Kumud Mishra <\nkmishra@diligent.com\n>; Jorgelina Venturi <\nj.venturi@lcwmail.com\n>\nSubject:\n\u00a0Re: Diligent - WO_DELMONTE_COC_080624 - Del Monte CoC\n\u00a0\nHello,\n\u00a0\nDel Monte will be following up with their LMS on this matter.

This method involves the least amount of scope increase since we're at the translation phase. See below for what I did to the package to relay to them. Then can use the Menu to skip to the Certification slide to test both clickable decisions.\n\u00a0\n<image019.png>\n\u00a0\nOn the screen below, when the learner selects the No, the course will complete when the final slide loads. If the learner selects Yes, then the course will register as incomplete when reaching the final slide. \nIf this is not enough for them, please have Del Monte describe how they are going to mitigate this issue for themselves internally with the limitations of their LMS, and we can adjust the package accordingly. \nSince their LMS doesn't allow the reportage they want, they need to decide how they are going to reach out to people who appear incomplete if this isn't good enough. That may even need to include adding language to the course that would then need translation. Reconfiguration/Testing of the course for numerical scores to be sent to signal the selected response in question, would take 1hr per language to adjust totaling $1400 ($140*10lg) additional to the scope on my end. The adjustment I did here would only increase the scope between $140-$280 overall to apply the fix.\n<image020.png>\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\nPlease let us know your comments.\nThanks!\nCDS\n\u00a0\nCatalina De Sanctis\nTranslation Specialist\nLCW\n<image021.png>\n\u00a0\nWebsite\n\u00a0| \nTwitter\n\u00a0| \nFacebook\n\u00a0| \nLinkedIn\nView our upcoming events\n\u00a0| \nSign-up for our newsletter\n\u00a0\nFrom:\n\u00a0Randi Mooney <\nrmooney@diligent.com\n>\nSent:\n\u00a0Tuesday, February 11, 2025 2:31 PM\nTo:\n\u00a0Catalina De Sanctis <\nc.desanctis@lcwmail.com\n>\nCc:\n\u00a0Brian Luong <\nbluong@diligent.com\n>; Don Reyes <\ndreyes@diligent.com\n>; Karen Lai <\nklai@diligent.com\n>; Kumud Mishra <\nkmishra@diligent.com\n>\nSubject:\n\u00a0Re: Diligent - WO_DELMONTE_COC_080624 - Del Monte CoC\n\u00a0\nHi Catalina,\n\u00a0\nI wanted to follow up to see if Dustin's new test file for Del Monte is ready?

But in the meantime, sent over an invite for Friday.\n\u00a0\nHere is a summary of the situation:\nDel Monte noted earlier this week that the SCORM 2004 test file worked well in their LMS but followed up asking if we could send them their test report.\nWe informed them that without explicit access to their LMS and metadata, it would not be possible to generate a report on their behalf.\nThey replied that their LMS does not allow for any reports to be exported. This is where the misunderstanding occurred.\nEarlier in the project, it was interpreted that they were not getting the desired information from SCORM 1.2 completion reports. That is why we decided to proceed with SCORM 2004 as it allows for customized reportage.\nWe have asked Del Monte to confirm with their LMS, Convercent, what type of reports or metadata can be generated or exported. Awaiting a response here.\nQuestions to discuss:\nIs there any way to run a report on behalf\u00a0of Del Monte?\nHave reporting capabilities been brought up in the prior year updates for Del Monte? If so, what was the recommendation?\nThanks!\n_________________________\nDiligent\nRandi Mooney (Doran),\n\u00a0she/her\nAdvisory Specialist II, Advisory & Consulting Services\nrmooney@diligent.com\n\u00a0| \ndiligent.com\n\u00a0\nFrom:\n\u00a0Catalina De Sanctis <\nc.desanctis@lcwmail.com\n>\nSent:\n\u00a0Wednesday, January 29, 2025 7:23 PM\nTo:\n\u00a0Randi Mooney <\nrmooney@diligent.com\n>; Brian Luong <\nbluong@diligent.com\n>\nCc:\n\u00a0Don Reyes <\ndreyes@diligent.com\n>; Karen Lai <\nklai@diligent.com\n>; Kumud Mishra <\nkmishra@diligent.com\n>\nSubject:\n\u00a0RE: Diligent - WO_DELMONTE_COC_080624 - Del Monte CoC\n\u00a0\nHello Randi,\nIm sorry, tomorrow is complicated.

We can adjust the\u00a0package to give them scores or try to adapt to their system of distinguishing learners with such limited LMS reporting features. But as shown with our testing, the packages have worked and we'll need their LMS to send us the exact settings that will be needed to accompany Del Monte's method of how they plan to distinguish learners who said Yes or No on the questionnaire.\u00a0\n\u00a0\nPerhaps their system only shows a complete pass/fail scenario? We'd need guidance from their LMS on how scores are captured and if it can distinguish a 50% score that \"fails\" but still passes the course.\u00a0\n\u00a0\nPlease note our so long back and forth comes from their limiting system and as you can notice we are flexible and doing our best to help them get what they need.\nPlease let us know.\nWe are happy to help.\nBest,\nCDS\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\nCatalina De Sanctis\nTranslation Specialist\nLCW\n<image003.png>\n\u00a0\nWebsite\n\u00a0| \nTwitter\n\u00a0| \nFacebook\n\u00a0| \nLinkedIn\nView our upcoming events\n\u00a0| \nSign-up for our newsletter\n\u00a0\nFrom:\n\u00a0Randi Mooney <\nrmooney@diligent.com\n>\nSent:\n\u00a0Thursday, February 20, 2025 1:49 PM\nTo:\n\u00a0Catalina De Sanctis <\nc.desanctis@lcwmail.com\n>\nCc:\n\u00a0Brian Luong <\nbluong@diligent.com\n>; Don Reyes <\ndreyes@diligent.com\n>; Karen Lai <\nklai@diligent.com\n>; Kumud Mishra <\nkmishra@diligent.com\n>; Jorgelina Venturi <\nj.venturi@lcwmail.com\n>\nSubject:\n\u00a0Re: Diligent - WO_DELMONTE_COC_080624 - Del Monte CoC\n\u00a0\nHello,\n\u00a0\nDel Monte will be following up with their LMS on this matter.

The issue we have is that we can't distinguish all blank scores that are incomplete, and we don't know if in fact they completed the course. We could even be ok with a blank score if the participant was able to complete the course.\n\u00a0\nThanks,\n_________________________\nDiligent\nRandi Mooney,\n\u00a0she/her\nAdvisory Specialist II, Advisory & Consulting Services\nrmooney@diligent.com\n\u00a0| \ndiligent.com\n\u00a0\nUpcoming PTO: February 20th - February 25th\nDisclaimer\nThe information contained in this communication from the sender is confidential.

We can adjust the\u00a0package to give them scores or try to adapt to their system of distinguishing learners with such limited LMS reporting features. But as shown with our testing, the packages have worked and we'll need their LMS to send us the exact settings that will be needed to accompany Del Monte's method of how they plan to distinguish learners who said Yes or No on the questionnaire.\u00a0\n\u00a0\nPerhaps their system only shows a complete pass/fail scenario? We'd need guidance from their LMS on how scores are captured and if it can distinguish a 50% score that \"fails\" but still passes the course.\u00a0\n\u00a0\nPlease note our so long back and forth comes from their limiting system and as you can notice we are flexible and doing our best to help them get what they need.\nPlease let us know.\nWe are happy to help.\nBest,\nCDS\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\nCatalina De Sanctis\nTranslation Specialist\nLCW\n<image003.png>\n\u00a0\nWebsite\n\u00a0| \nTwitter\n\u00a0| \nFacebook\n\u00a0| \nLinkedIn\nView our upcoming events\n\u00a0| \nSign-up for our newsletter\n\u00a0\nFrom:\n\u00a0Randi Mooney <\nrmooney@diligent.com\n>\nSent:\n\u00a0Thursday, February 20, 2025 1:49 PM\nTo:\n\u00a0Catalina De Sanctis <\nc.desanctis@lcwmail.com\n>\nCc:\n\u00a0Brian Luong <\nbluong@diligent.com\n>; Don Reyes <\ndreyes@diligent.com\n>; Karen Lai <\nklai@diligent.com\n>; Kumud Mishra <\nkmishra@diligent.com\n>; Jorgelina Venturi <\nj.venturi@lcwmail.com\n>\nSubject:\n\u00a0Re: Diligent - WO_DELMONTE_COC_080624 - Del Monte CoC\n\u00a0\nHello,\n\u00a0\nDel Monte will be following up with their LMS on this matter.

The issue we have is that we can't distinguish all blank scores that are incomplete, and we don't know if in fact they completed the course.

This method involves the least amount of scope increase since we're at the translation phase. See below for what I did to the package to relay to them. Then can use the Menu to skip to the Certification slide to test both clickable decisions.\n\u00a0\n<image019.png>\n\u00a0\nOn the screen below, when the learner selects the No, the course will complete when the final slide loads. If the learner selects Yes, then the course will register as incomplete when reaching the final slide. \nIf this is not enough for them, please have Del Monte describe how they are going to mitigate this issue for themselves internally with the limitations of their LMS, and we can adjust the package accordingly. \nSince their LMS doesn't allow the reportage they want, they need to decide how they are going to reach out to people who appear incomplete if this isn't good enough. That may even need to include adding language to the course that would then need translation. Reconfiguration/Testing of the course for numerical scores to be sent to signal the selected response in question, would take 1hr per language to adjust totaling $1400 ($140*10lg) additional to the scope on my end. The adjustment I did here would only increase the scope between $140-$280 overall to apply the fix.\n<image020.png>\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\nPlease let us know your comments.\nThanks!\nCDS\n\u00a0\nCatalina De Sanctis\nTranslation Specialist\nLCW\n<image021.png>\n\u00a0\nWebsite\n\u00a0| \nTwitter\n\u00a0| \nFacebook\n\u00a0| \nLinkedIn\nView our upcoming events\n\u00a0| \nSign-up for our newsletter\n\u00a0\nFrom:\n\u00a0Randi Mooney <\nrmooney@diligent.com\n>\nSent:\n\u00a0Tuesday, February 11, 2025 2:31 PM\nTo:\n\u00a0Catalina De Sanctis <\nc.desanctis@lcwmail.com\n>\nCc:\n\u00a0Brian Luong <\nbluong@diligent.com\n>; Don Reyes <\ndreyes@diligent.com\n>; Karen Lai <\nklai@diligent.com\n>; Kumud Mishra <\nkmishra@diligent.com\n>\nSubject:\n\u00a0Re: Diligent - WO_DELMONTE_COC_080624 - Del Monte CoC\n\u00a0\nHi Catalina,\n\u00a0\nI wanted to follow up to see if Dustin's new test file for Del Monte is ready?

But in the meantime, sent over an invite for Friday.\n\u00a0\nHere is a summary of the situation:\nDel Monte noted earlier this week that the SCORM 2004 test file worked well in their LMS but followed up asking if we could send them their test report.\nWe informed them that without explicit access to their LMS and metadata, it would not be possible to generate a report on their behalf.\nThey replied that their LMS does not allow for any reports to be exported. This is where the misunderstanding occurred.\nEarlier in the project, it was interpreted that they were not getting the desired information from SCORM 1.2 completion reports. That is why we decided to proceed with SCORM 2004 as it allows for customized reportage.\nWe have asked Del Monte to confirm with their LMS, Convercent, what type of reports or metadata can be generated or exported. Awaiting a response here.\nQuestions to discuss:\nIs there any way to run a report on behalf\u00a0of Del Monte?\nHave reporting capabilities been brought up in the prior year updates for Del Monte? If so, what was the recommendation?\nThanks!\n_________________________\nDiligent\nRandi Mooney (Doran),\n\u00a0she/her\nAdvisory Specialist II, Advisory & Consulting Services\nrmooney@diligent.com\n\u00a0| \ndiligent.com\n\u00a0\nFrom:\n\u00a0Catalina De Sanctis <\nc.desanctis@lcwmail.com\n>\nSent:\n\u00a0Wednesday, January 29, 2025 7:23 PM\nTo:\n\u00a0Randi Mooney <\nrmooney@diligent.com\n>; Brian Luong <\nbluong@diligent.com\n>\nCc:\n\u00a0Don Reyes <\ndreyes@diligent.com\n>; Karen Lai <\nklai@diligent.com\n>; Kumud Mishra <\nkmishra@diligent.com\n>\nSubject:\n\u00a0RE: Diligent - WO_DELMONTE_COC_080624 - Del Monte CoC\n\u00a0\nHello Randi,\nIm sorry, tomorrow is complicated.

We can adjust the\u00a0package to give them scores or try to adapt to their system of distinguishing learners with such limited LMS reporting features. But as shown with our testing, the packages have worked and we'll need their LMS to send us the exact settings that will be needed to accompany Del Monte's method of how they plan to distinguish learners who said Yes or No on the questionnaire.\u00a0\n\u00a0\nPerhaps their system only shows a complete pass/fail scenario? We'd need guidance from their LMS on how scores are captured and if it can distinguish a 50% score that \"fails\" but still passes the course.\u00a0\n\u00a0\nPlease note our so long back and forth comes from their limiting system and as you can notice we are flexible and doing our best to help them get what they need.\nPlease let us know.\nWe are happy to help.\nBest,\nCDS\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\nCatalina De Sanctis\nTranslation Specialist\nLCW\n<image003.png>\n\u00a0\nWebsite\n\u00a0| \nTwitter\n\u00a0| \nFacebook\n\u00a0| \nLinkedIn\nView our upcoming events\n\u00a0| \nSign-up for our newsletter\n\u00a0\nFrom:\n\u00a0Randi Mooney <\nrmooney@diligent.com\n>\nSent:\n\u00a0Thursday, February 20, 2025 1:49 PM\nTo:\n\u00a0Catalina De Sanctis <\nc.desanctis@lcwmail.com\n>\nCc:\n\u00a0Brian Luong <\nbluong@diligent.com\n>; Don Reyes <\ndreyes@diligent.com\n>; Karen Lai <\nklai@diligent.com\n>; Kumud Mishra <\nkmishra@diligent.com\n>; Jorgelina Venturi <\nj.venturi@lcwmail.com\n>\nSubject:\n\u00a0Re: Diligent - WO_DELMONTE_COC_080624 - Del Monte CoC\n\u00a0\nHello,\n\u00a0\nDel Monte will be following up with their LMS on this matter.

This method involves the least amount of scope increase since we're at the translation phase. See below for what I did to the package to relay to them. Then can use the Menu to skip to the Certification slide to test both clickable decisions.\n\u00a0\n<image019.png>\n\u00a0\nOn the screen below, when the learner selects the No, the course will complete when the final slide loads. If the learner selects Yes, then the course will register as incomplete when reaching the final slide. \nIf this is not enough for them, please have Del Monte describe how they are going to mitigate this issue for themselves internally with the limitations of their LMS, and we can adjust the package accordingly. \nSince their LMS doesn't allow the reportage they want, they need to decide how they are going to reach out to people who appear incomplete if this isn't good enough. That may even need to include adding language to the course that would then need translation. Reconfiguration/Testing of the course for numerical scores to be sent to signal the selected response in question, would take 1hr per language to adjust totaling $1400 ($140*10lg) additional to the scope on my end. The adjustment I did here would only increase the scope between $140-$280 overall to apply the fix.\n<image020.png>\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\nPlease let us know your comments.\nThanks!\nCDS\n\u00a0\nCatalina De Sanctis\nTranslation Specialist\nLCW\n<image021.png>\n\u00a0\nWebsite\n\u00a0| \nTwitter\n\u00a0| \nFacebook\n\u00a0| \nLinkedIn\nView our upcoming events\n\u00a0| \nSign-up for our newsletter\n\u00a0\nFrom:\n\u00a0Randi Mooney <\nrmooney@diligent.com\n>\nSent:\n\u00a0Tuesday, February 11, 2025 2:31 PM\nTo:\n\u00a0Catalina De Sanctis <\nc.desanctis@lcwmail.com\n>\nCc:\n\u00a0Brian Luong <\nbluong@diligent.com\n>; Don Reyes <\ndreyes@diligent.com\n>; Karen Lai <\nklai@diligent.com\n>; Kumud Mishra <\nkmishra@diligent.com\n>\nSubject:\n\u00a0Re: Diligent - WO_DELMONTE_COC_080624 - Del Monte CoC\n\u00a0\nHi Catalina,\n\u00a0\nI wanted to follow up to see if Dustin's new test file for Del Monte is ready?

But in the meantime, sent over an invite for Friday.\n\u00a0\nHere is a summary of the situation:\nDel Monte noted earlier this week that the SCORM 2004 test file worked well in their LMS but followed up asking if we could send them their test report.\nWe informed them that without explicit access to their LMS and metadata, it would not be possible to generate a report on their behalf.\nThey replied that their LMS does not allow for any reports to be exported. This is where the misunderstanding occurred.\nEarlier in the project, it was interpreted that they were not getting the desired information from SCORM 1.2 completion reports. That is why we decided to proceed with SCORM 2004 as it allows for customized reportage.\nWe have asked Del Monte to confirm with their LMS, Convercent, what type of reports or metadata can be generated or exported. Awaiting a response here.\nQuestions to discuss:\nIs there any way to run a report on behalf\u00a0of Del Monte?\nHave reporting capabilities been brought up in the prior year updates for Del Monte? If so, what was the recommendation?\nThanks!\n_________________________\nDiligent\nRandi Mooney (Doran),\n\u00a0she/her\nAdvisory Specialist II, Advisory & Consulting Services\nrmooney@diligent.com\n\u00a0| \ndiligent.com\n\u00a0\nFrom:\n\u00a0Catalina De Sanctis <\nc.desanctis@lcwmail.com\n>\nSent:\n\u00a0Wednesday, January 29, 2025 7:23 PM\nTo:\n\u00a0Randi Mooney <\nrmooney@diligent.com\n>; Brian Luong <\nbluong@diligent.com\n>\nCc:\n\u00a0Don Reyes <\ndreyes@diligent.com\n>; Karen Lai <\nklai@diligent.com\n>; Kumud Mishra <\nkmishra@diligent.com\n>\nSubject:\n\u00a0RE: Diligent - WO_DELMONTE_COC_080624 - Del Monte CoC\n\u00a0\nHello Randi,\nIm sorry, tomorrow is complicated.

We can adjust the\u00a0package to give them scores or try to adapt to their system of distinguishing learners with such limited LMS reporting features. But as shown with our testing, the packages have worked and we'll need their LMS to send us the exact settings that will be needed to accompany Del Monte's method of how they plan to distinguish learners who said Yes or No on the questionnaire.\u00a0\n\u00a0\nPerhaps their system only shows a complete pass/fail scenario? We'd need guidance from their LMS on how scores are captured and if it can distinguish a 50% score that \"fails\" but still passes the course.\u00a0\n\u00a0\nPlease note our so long back and forth comes from their limiting system and as you can notice we are flexible and doing our best to help them get what they need.\nPlease let us know.\nWe are happy to help.\nBest,\nCDS\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\nCatalina De Sanctis\nTranslation Specialist\nLCW\n<image003.png>\n\u00a0\nWebsite\n\u00a0| \nTwitter\n\u00a0| \nFacebook\n\u00a0| \nLinkedIn\nView our upcoming events\n\u00a0| \nSign-up for our newsletter\n\u00a0\nFrom:\n\u00a0Randi Mooney <\nrmooney@diligent.com\n>\nSent:\n\u00a0Thursday, February 20, 2025 1:49 PM\nTo:\n\u00a0Catalina De Sanctis <\nc.desanctis@lcwmail.com\n>\nCc:\n\u00a0Brian Luong <\nbluong@diligent.com\n>; Don Reyes <\ndreyes@diligent.com\n>; Karen Lai <\nklai@diligent.com\n>; Kumud Mishra <\nkmishra@diligent.com\n>; Jorgelina Venturi <\nj.venturi@lcwmail.com\n>\nSubject:\n\u00a0Re: Diligent - WO_DELMONTE_COC_080624 - Del Monte CoC\n\u00a0\nHello,\n\u00a0\nDel Monte will be following up with their LMS on this matter.

This method involves the least amount of scope increase since we're at the translation phase. See below for what I did to the package to relay to them. Then can use the Menu to skip to the Certification slide to test both clickable decisions.\n\u00a0\n<image019.png>\n\u00a0\nOn the screen below, when the learner selects the No, the course will complete when the final slide loads. If the learner selects Yes, then the course will register as incomplete when reaching the final slide. \nIf this is not enough for them, please have Del Monte describe how they are going to mitigate this issue for themselves internally with the limitations of their LMS, and we can adjust the package accordingly. \nSince their LMS doesn't allow the reportage they want, they need to decide how they are going to reach out to people who appear incomplete if this isn't good enough. That may even need to include adding language to the course that would then need translation. Reconfiguration/Testing of the course for numerical scores to be sent to signal the selected response in question, would take 1hr per language to adjust totaling $1400 ($140*10lg) additional to the scope on my end. The adjustment I did here would only increase the scope between $140-$280 overall to apply the fix.\n<image020.png>\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\nPlease let us know your comments.\nThanks!\nCDS\n\u00a0\nCatalina De Sanctis\nTranslation Specialist\nLCW\n<image021.png>\n\u00a0\nWebsite\n\u00a0| \nTwitter\n\u00a0| \nFacebook\n\u00a0| \nLinkedIn\nView our upcoming events\n\u00a0| \nSign-up for our newsletter\n\u00a0\nFrom:\n\u00a0Randi Mooney <\nrmooney@diligent.com\n>\nSent:\n\u00a0Tuesday, February 11, 2025 2:31 PM\nTo:\n\u00a0Catalina De Sanctis <\nc.desanctis@lcwmail.com\n>\nCc:\n\u00a0Brian Luong <\nbluong@diligent.com\n>; Don Reyes <\ndreyes@diligent.com\n>; Karen Lai <\nklai@diligent.com\n>; Kumud Mishra <\nkmishra@diligent.com\n>\nSubject:\n\u00a0Re: Diligent - WO_DELMONTE_COC_080624 - Del Monte CoC\n\u00a0\nHi Catalina,\n\u00a0\nI wanted to follow up to see if Dustin's new test file for Del Monte is ready?

But in the meantime, sent over an invite for Friday.\n\u00a0\nHere is a summary of the situation:\nDel Monte noted earlier this week that the SCORM 2004 test file worked well in their LMS but followed up asking if we could send them their test report.\nWe informed them that without explicit access to their LMS and metadata, it would not be possible to generate a report on their behalf.\nThey replied that their LMS does not allow for any reports to be exported. This is where the misunderstanding occurred.\nEarlier in the project, it was interpreted that they were not getting the desired information from SCORM 1.2 completion reports. That is why we decided to proceed with SCORM 2004 as it allows for customized reportage.\nWe have asked Del Monte to confirm with their LMS, Convercent, what type of reports or metadata can be generated or exported. Awaiting a response here.\nQuestions to discuss:\nIs there any way to run a report on behalf\u00a0of Del Monte?\nHave reporting capabilities been brought up in the prior year updates for Del Monte? If so, what was the recommendation?\nThanks!\n_________________________\nDiligent\nRandi Mooney (Doran),\n\u00a0she/her\nAdvisory Specialist II, Advisory & Consulting Services\nrmooney@diligent.com\n\u00a0| \ndiligent.com\n\u00a0\nFrom:\n\u00a0Catalina De Sanctis <\nc.desanctis@lcwmail.com\n>\nSent:\n\u00a0Wednesday, January 29, 2025 7:23 PM\nTo:\n\u00a0Randi Mooney <\nrmooney@diligent.com\n>; Brian Luong <\nbluong@diligent.com\n>\nCc:\n\u00a0Don Reyes <\ndreyes@diligent.com\n>; Karen Lai <\nklai@diligent.com\n>; Kumud Mishra <\nkmishra@diligent.com\n>\nSubject:\n\u00a0RE: Diligent - WO_DELMONTE_COC_080624 - Del Monte CoC\n\u00a0\nHello Randi,\nIm sorry, tomorrow is complicated.

We can adjust the\u00a0package to give them scores or try to adapt to their system of distinguishing learners with such limited LMS reporting features. But as shown with our testing, the packages have worked and we'll need their LMS to send us the exact settings that will be needed to accompany Del Monte's method of how they plan to distinguish learners who said Yes or No on the questionnaire.\u00a0\n\u00a0\nPerhaps their system only shows a complete pass/fail scenario? We'd need guidance from their LMS on how scores are captured and if it can distinguish a 50% score that \"fails\" but still passes the course.\u00a0\n\u00a0\nPlease note our so long back and forth comes from their limiting system and as you can notice we are flexible and doing our best to help them get what they need.\nPlease let us know.\nWe are happy to help.\nBest,\nCDS\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\nCatalina De Sanctis\nTranslation Specialist\nLCW\n<image003.png>\n\u00a0\nWebsite\n\u00a0| \nTwitter\n\u00a0| \nFacebook\n\u00a0| \nLinkedIn\nView our upcoming events\n\u00a0| \nSign-up for our newsletter\n\u00a0\nFrom:\n\u00a0Randi Mooney <\nrmooney@diligent.com\n>\nSent:\n\u00a0Thursday, February 20, 2025 1:49 PM\nTo:\n\u00a0Catalina De Sanctis <\nc.desanctis@lcwmail.com\n>\nCc:\n\u00a0Brian Luong <\nbluong@diligent.com\n>; Don Reyes <\ndreyes@diligent.com\n>; Karen Lai <\nklai@diligent.com\n>; Kumud Mishra <\nkmishra@diligent.com\n>; Jorgelina Venturi <\nj.venturi@lcwmail.com\n>\nSubject:\n\u00a0Re: Diligent - WO_DELMONTE_COC_080624 - Del Monte CoC\n\u00a0\nHello,\n\u00a0\nDel Monte will be following up with their LMS on this matter.

The issue we have is that we can't distinguish all blank scores that are incomplete, and we don't know if in fact they completed the course. We could even be ok with a blank score if the participant was able to complete the course.\n\u00a0\nThanks,\n_________________________\nDiligent\nRandi Mooney,\n\u00a0she/her\nAdvisory Specialist II, Advisory & Consulting Services\nrmooney@diligent.com\n\u00a0| \ndiligent.com\n\u00a0\nUpcoming PTO: February 20th - February 25th",

We can adjust the\u00a0package to give them scores or try to adapt to their system of distinguishing learners with such limited LMS reporting features. But as shown with our testing, the packages have worked and we'll need their LMS to send us the exact settings that will be needed to accompany Del Monte's method of how they plan to distinguish learners who said Yes or No on the questionnaire.\u00a0\n\u00a0\nPerhaps their system only shows a complete pass/fail scenario? We'd need guidance from their LMS on how scores are captured and if it can distinguish a 50% score that \"fails\" but still passes the course.\u00a0\n\u00a0\nPlease note our so long back and forth comes from their limiting system and as you can notice we are flexible and doing our best to help them get what they need.\nPlease let us know.\nWe are happy to help.\nBest,\nCDS\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\nCatalina De Sanctis\nTranslation Specialist\nLCW\n<image003.png>\n\u00a0\nWebsite\n\u00a0| \nTwitter\n\u00a0| \nFacebook\n\u00a0| \nLinkedIn\nView our upcoming events\n\u00a0| \nSign-up for our newsletter\n\u00a0\nFrom:\n\u00a0Randi Mooney <\nrmooney@diligent.com\n>\nSent:\n\u00a0Thursday, February 20, 2025 1:49 PM\nTo:\n\u00a0Catalina De Sanctis <\nc.desanctis@lcwmail.com\n>\nCc:\n\u00a0Brian Luong <\nbluong@diligent.com\n>; Don Reyes <\ndreyes@diligent.com\n>; Karen Lai <\nklai@diligent.com\n>; Kumud Mishra <\nkmishra@diligent.com\n>; Jorgelina Venturi <\nj.venturi@lcwmail.com\n>\nSubject:\n\u00a0Re: Diligent - WO_DELMONTE_COC_080624 - Del Monte CoC\n\u00a0\nHello,\n\u00a0\nDel Monte will be following up with their LMS on this matter.

The issue we have is that we can't distinguish all blank scores that are incomplete, and we don't know if in fact they completed the course. We could even be ok with a blank score if the participant was able to complete the course.\n\u00a0\nThanks,\n_________________________\nDiligent\nRandi Mooney,\n\u00a0she/her\nAdvisory Specialist II, Advisory & Consulting Services\nrmooney@diligent.com\n\u00a0| \ndiligent.com\n\u00a0\nUpcoming PTO: February 20th - February 25th",

We can adjust the\u00a0package to give them scores or try to adapt to their system of distinguishing learners with such limited LMS reporting features. But as shown with our testing, the packages have worked and we'll need their LMS to send us the exact settings that will be needed to accompany Del Monte's method of how they plan to distinguish learners who said Yes or No on the questionnaire.\u00a0\n\u00a0\nPerhaps their system only shows a complete pass/fail scenario? We'd need guidance from their LMS on how scores are captured and if it can distinguish a 50% score that \"fails\" but still passes the course.\u00a0\n\u00a0\nPlease note our so long back and forth comes from their limiting system and as you can notice we are flexible and doing our best to help them get what they need.\nPlease let us know.\nWe are happy to help.\nBest,\nCDS\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\nCatalina De Sanctis\nTranslation Specialist\nLCW\n<image003.png>\n\u00a0\nWebsite\n\u00a0| \nTwitter\n\u00a0| \nFacebook\n\u00a0| \nLinkedIn\nView our upcoming events\n\u00a0| \nSign-up for our newsletter\n\u00a0\nFrom:\n\u00a0Randi Mooney <\nrmooney@diligent.com\n>\nSent:\n\u00a0Thursday, February 20, 2025 1:49 PM\nTo:\n\u00a0Catalina De Sanctis <\nc.desanctis@lcwmail.com\n>\nCc:\n\u00a0Brian Luong <\nbluong@diligent.com\n>; Don Reyes <\ndreyes@diligent.com\n>; Karen Lai <\nklai@diligent.com\n>; Kumud Mishra <\nkmishra@diligent.com\n>; Jorgelina Venturi <\nj.venturi@lcwmail.com\n>\nSubject:\n\u00a0Re: Diligent - WO_DELMONTE_COC_080624 - Del Monte CoC\n\u00a0\nHello,\n\u00a0\nDel Monte will be following up with their LMS on this matter. Also including another \ncomment \nDel Monte provided below:\n\u00a0\nI just sent the question to Convercent but in the screenshot shared, it showed a score of 100 for completion and a blank score for incompletion, so I don't think it is pass/fail score? The issue we have is that we can't distinguish all blank scores that are incomplete, and we don't know if in fact they completed the course. We could even be ok with a blank score if the participant was able to complete the course.\n\u00a0\nThanks,\n_________________________\nDiligent\nRandi Mooney,\n\u00a0she/her\nAdvisory Specialist II, Advisory & Consulting Services\nrmooney@diligent.com\n\u00a0| \ndiligent.com\n\u00a0\nUpcoming PTO: February 20th - February 25th",

If you need something from me, please email me\n \nI think we should keep our \ncall with Diligent on Tues\n, even if we don't have anything open. I want them to know we are committed to them & available to them.\n \nSure thing, I thought they only needed us if anything in progress\nI think you should still send the\n\u00a0Excel doc/summary\n\u00a0to the Diligent team on Monday (or prior to the Tues call) and list anything that has been recently completed or is outstanding. For example, this GXO Quote is s\ntill awaiting a response from Diligent/GXO \nhttps://lcw.scoro.com/quotes/view/1565\n.\u00a0\nIs there any quote im not awaere of? Ill share it on Monday for sure!\nDustin lateness\n\u00a0- regarding him being late with the last project... \nIt would be great if we could be more proactive with Diligent. For example, if you see that Dustin is late, proactively reach out to him to find out what's going on & then report back to the client \nbefore \nthey have the chance to follow up with us \n\ud83d\ude42\n. \nI'd rather us reach out first to explain the delay than them coming to us.\n \nYou are right, keep this in mind\nDustin processes\n\u00a0- up to you, but just a thought... \nMaybe it would be easier for Dustin to create the process docs first, and then you have a chat with him to discuss?? Again, this is totally up to you. I'm just thinking that maybe that would be better than you writing everything up. You could give him 1 process to do (like Diligent Code of Conduct), review it, re-work the formatting, make sure if has everything you need, talk to him about it... And then once the format is agreed upon & he understands what info he needs to give you, then he can do the other docs.\nI'm not trying to micromanage here... It really is just a suggestion. But feel free to do it however you want. \nI may not be able to join the calls bc my schedule has been crazy\n! I agree, I need to understand what he does because im still lost there ill reach out to him now and cc you there.\nI did not forget about \nonboarding docs for translators\n. \nWill look at that by next week. \nWill try to get to it this morning.\n \nNo rush on this!!\n\u00a0\nLMK if you have any questions/thoughts.\nThank you Cecilia!\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\nNicole Barile\n\u00a0\n(She/Her)\nChief Operating Officer\nLCW\n\u00a0\n<image002.png>\nWebsite\n\u00a0\n|\n\u00a0\nTwitter\n\u00a0\n|\n\u00a0\nFacebook\n\u00a0\n|\n\u00a0\nLinkedIn\nView our upcoming events\n\u00a0| \nSign-up for our newsletter",

We can adjust the\u00a0package to give them scores or try to adapt to their system of distinguishing learners with such limited LMS reporting features. But as shown with our testing, the packages have worked and we'll need their LMS to send us the exact settings that will be needed to accompany Del Monte's method of how they plan to distinguish learners who said Yes or No on the questionnaire.\u00a0\n\u00a0\nPerhaps their system only shows a complete pass/fail scenario? We'd need guidance from their LMS on how scores are captured and if it can distinguish a 50% score that \"fails\" but still passes the course.\u00a0\n\u00a0\nPlease note our so long back and forth comes from their limiting system and as you can notice we are flexible and doing our best to help them get what they need.\nPlease let us know.\nWe are happy to help.\nBest,\nCDS\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\nCatalina De Sanctis\nTranslation Specialist\nLCW\n<image003.png>\n\u00a0\nWebsite\n\u00a0| \nTwitter\n\u00a0| \nFacebook\n\u00a0| \nLinkedIn\nView our upcoming events\n\u00a0| \nSign-up for our newsletter\n\u00a0\nFrom:\n\u00a0Randi Mooney <\nrmooney@diligent.com\n>\nSent:\n\u00a0Thursday, February 20, 2025 1:49 PM\nTo:\n\u00a0Catalina De Sanctis <\nc.desanctis@lcwmail.com\n>\nCc:\n\u00a0Brian Luong <\nbluong@diligent.com\n>; Don Reyes <\ndreyes@diligent.com\n>; Karen Lai <\nklai@diligent.com\n>; Kumud Mishra <\nkmishra@diligent.com\n>; Jorgelina Venturi <\nj.venturi@lcwmail.com\n>\nSubject:\n\u00a0Re: Diligent - WO_DELMONTE_COC_080624 - Del Monte CoC\n\u00a0\nHello,\n\u00a0\nDel Monte will be following up with their LMS on this matter.

The issue we have is that we can't distinguish all blank scores that are incomplete, and we don't know if in fact they completed the course.

This method involves the least amount of scope increase since we're at the translation phase. See below for what I did to the package to relay to them. Then can use the Menu to skip to the Certification slide to test both clickable decisions.\n\u00a0\n<image019.png>\n\u00a0\nOn the screen below, when the learner selects the No, the course will complete when the final slide loads. If the learner selects Yes, then the course will register as incomplete when reaching the final slide. \nIf this is not enough for them, please have Del Monte describe how they are going to mitigate this issue for themselves internally with the limitations of their LMS, and we can adjust the package accordingly. \nSince their LMS doesn't allow the reportage they want, they need to decide how they are going to reach out to people who appear incomplete if this isn't good enough. That may even need to include adding language to the course that would then need translation. Reconfiguration/Testing of the course for numerical scores to be sent to signal the selected response in question, would take 1hr per language to adjust totaling $1400 ($140*10lg) additional to the scope on my end. The adjustment I did here would only increase the scope between $140-$280 overall to apply the fix.\n<image020.png>\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\nPlease let us know your comments.\nThanks!\nCDS\n\u00a0\nCatalina De Sanctis\nTranslation Specialist\nLCW\n<image021.png>\n\u00a0\nWebsite\n\u00a0| \nTwitter\n\u00a0| \nFacebook\n\u00a0| \nLinkedIn\nView our upcoming events\n\u00a0| \nSign-up for our newsletter\n\u00a0\nFrom:\n\u00a0Randi Mooney <\nrmooney@diligent.com\n>\nSent:\n\u00a0Tuesday, February 11, 2025 2:31 PM\nTo:\n\u00a0Catalina De Sanctis <\nc.desanctis@lcwmail.com\n>\nCc:\n\u00a0Brian Luong <\nbluong@diligent.com\n>; Don Reyes <\ndreyes@diligent.com\n>; Karen Lai <\nklai@diligent.com\n>; Kumud Mishra <\nkmishra@diligent.com\n>\nSubject:\n\u00a0Re: Diligent - WO_DELMONTE_COC_080624 - Del Monte CoC\n\u00a0\nHi Catalina,\n\u00a0\nI wanted to follow up to see if Dustin's new test file for Del Monte is ready?

But in the meantime, sent over an invite for Friday.\n\u00a0\nHere is a summary of the situation:\nDel Monte noted earlier this week that the SCORM 2004 test file worked well in their LMS but followed up asking if we could send them their test report.\nWe informed them that without explicit access to their LMS and metadata, it would not be possible to generate a report on their behalf.\nThey replied that their LMS does not allow for any reports to be exported. This is where the misunderstanding occurred.\nEarlier in the project, it was interpreted that they were not getting the desired information from SCORM 1.2 completion reports. That is why we decided to proceed with SCORM 2004 as it allows for customized reportage.\nWe have asked Del Monte to confirm with their LMS, Convercent, what type of reports or metadata can be generated or exported. Awaiting a response here.\nQuestions to discuss:\nIs there any way to run a report on behalf\u00a0of Del Monte?\nHave reporting capabilities been brought up in the prior year updates for Del Monte? If so, what was the recommendation?\nThanks!\n_________________________\nDiligent\nRandi Mooney (Doran),\n\u00a0she/her\nAdvisory Specialist II, Advisory & Consulting Services\nrmooney@diligent.com\n\u00a0| \ndiligent.com\n\u00a0\nFrom:\n\u00a0Catalina De Sanctis <\nc.desanctis@lcwmail.com\n>\nSent:\n\u00a0Wednesday, January 29, 2025 7:23 PM\nTo:\n\u00a0Randi Mooney <\nrmooney@diligent.com\n>; Brian Luong <\nbluong@diligent.com\n>\nCc:\n\u00a0Don Reyes <\ndreyes@diligent.com\n>; Karen Lai <\nklai@diligent.com\n>; Kumud Mishra <\nkmishra@diligent.com\n>\nSubject:\n\u00a0RE: Diligent - WO_DELMONTE_COC_080624 - Del Monte CoC\n\u00a0\nHello Randi,\nIm sorry, tomorrow is complicated.

We can adjust the\u00a0package to give them scores or try to adapt to their system of distinguishing learners with such limited LMS reporting features. But as shown with our testing, the packages have worked and we'll need their LMS to send us the exact settings that will be needed to accompany Del Monte's method of how they plan to distinguish learners who said Yes or No on the questionnaire.\u00a0\n\u00a0\nPerhaps their system only shows a complete pass/fail scenario? We'd need guidance from their LMS on how scores are captured and if it can distinguish a 50% score that \"fails\" but still passes the course.\u00a0\n\u00a0\nPlease note our so long back and forth comes from their limiting system and as you can notice we are flexible and doing our best to help them get what they need.\nPlease let us know.\nWe are happy to help.\nBest,\nCDS\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\nCatalina De Sanctis\nTranslation Specialist\nLCW\n<image003.png>\n\u00a0\nWebsite\n\u00a0| \nTwitter\n\u00a0| \nFacebook\n\u00a0| \nLinkedIn\nView our upcoming events\n\u00a0| \nSign-up for our newsletter\n\u00a0\nFrom:\n\u00a0Randi Mooney <\nrmooney@diligent.com\n>\nSent:\n\u00a0Thursday, February 20, 2025 1:49 PM\nTo:\n\u00a0Catalina De Sanctis <\nc.desanctis@lcwmail.com\n>\nCc:\n\u00a0Brian Luong <\nbluong@diligent.com\n>; Don Reyes <\ndreyes@diligent.com\n>; Karen Lai <\nklai@diligent.com\n>; Kumud Mishra <\nkmishra@diligent.com\n>; Jorgelina Venturi <\nj.venturi@lcwmail.com\n>\nSubject:\n\u00a0Re: Diligent - WO_DELMONTE_COC_080624 - Del Monte CoC\n\u00a0\nHello,\n\u00a0\nDel Monte will be following up with their LMS on this matter.

The issue we have is that we can't distinguish all blank scores that are incomplete, and we don't know if in fact they completed the course.

We can adjust the\u00a0package to give them scores or try to adapt to their system of distinguishing learners with such limited LMS reporting features. But as shown with our testing, the packages have worked and we'll need their LMS to send us the exact settings that will be needed to accompany Del Monte's method of how they plan to distinguish learners who said Yes or No on the questionnaire.\u00a0\n\u00a0\nPerhaps their system only shows a complete pass/fail scenario? We'd need guidance from their LMS on how scores are captured and if it can distinguish a 50% score that \"fails\" but still passes the course.\u00a0\n\u00a0\nPlease note our so long back and forth comes from their limiting system and as you can notice we are flexible and doing our best to help them get what they need.\nPlease let us know.\nWe are happy to help.\nBest,\nCDS\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\nCatalina De Sanctis\nTranslation Specialist\nLCW\n<image003.png>\n\u00a0\nWebsite\n\u00a0| \nTwitter\n\u00a0| \nFacebook\n\u00a0| \nLinkedIn\nView our upcoming events\n\u00a0| \nSign-up for our newsletter\n\u00a0\nFrom:\n\u00a0Randi Mooney <\nrmooney@diligent.com\n>\nSent:\n\u00a0Thursday, February 20, 2025 1:49 PM\nTo:\n\u00a0Catalina De Sanctis <\nc.desanctis@lcwmail.com\n>\nCc:\n\u00a0Brian Luong <\nbluong@diligent.com\n>; Don Reyes <\ndreyes@diligent.com\n>; Karen Lai <\nklai@diligent.com\n>; Kumud Mishra <\nkmishra@diligent.com\n>; Jorgelina Venturi <\nj.venturi@lcwmail.com\n>\nSubject:\n\u00a0Re: Diligent - WO_DELMONTE_COC_080624 - Del Monte CoC\n\u00a0\nHello,\n\u00a0\nDel Monte will be following up with their LMS on this matter. Also including another \ncomment \nDel Monte provided below:\n\u00a0\nI just sent the question to Convercent but in the screenshot shared, it showed a score of 100 for completion and a blank score for incompletion, so I don't think it is pass/fail score? The issue we have is that we can't distinguish all blank scores that are incomplete, and we don't know if in fact they completed the course. We could even be ok with a blank score if the participant was able to complete the course.\n\u00a0\nThanks,\n_________________________\nDiligent\nRandi Mooney,\n\u00a0she/her\nAdvisory Specialist II, Advisory & Consulting Services\nrmooney@diligent.com\n\u00a0| \ndiligent.com\n\u00a0\nUpcoming PTO: February 20th - February 25th\n\u00a0\nFrom:\n\u00a0Catalina De Sanctis <\nc.desanctis@lcwmail.com\n>\nSent:\n\u00a0Thursday, February 20, 2025 9:56 AM\nTo:\n\u00a0Randi Mooney <\nrmooney@diligent.com\n>\nCc:\n\u00a0Brian Luong <\nbluong@diligent.com\n>; Don Reyes <\ndreyes@diligent.com\n>; Karen Lai <\nklai@diligent.com\n>; Kumud Mishra <\nkmishra@diligent.com\n>; Jorgelina Venturi <\nj.venturi@lcwmail.com\n>\nSubject:\n\u00a0RE: Diligent - WO_DELMONTE_COC_080624 - Del Monte CoC\n\u00a0\nEXTERNAL:\u00a0This email originated from outside of the organization.

We can adjust the\u00a0package to give them scores or try to adapt to their system of distinguishing learners with such limited LMS reporting features. But as shown with our testing, the packages have worked and we'll need their LMS to send us the exact settings that will be needed to accompany Del Monte's method of how they plan to distinguish learners who said Yes or No on the questionnaire.\u00a0\n\u00a0\nPerhaps their system only shows a complete pass/fail scenario? We'd need guidance from their LMS on how scores are captured and if it can distinguish a 50% score that \"fails\" but still passes the course.\u00a0\n\u00a0\nPlease note our so long back and forth comes from their limiting system and as you can notice we are flexible and doing our best to help them get what they need.\nPlease let us know.\nWe are happy to help.\nBest,\nCDS\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\nCatalina De Sanctis\nTranslation Specialist\nLCW\n<image003.png>\n\u00a0\nWebsite\n\u00a0| \nTwitter\n\u00a0| \nFacebook\n\u00a0| \nLinkedIn\nView our upcoming events\n\u00a0| \nSign-up for our newsletter\n\u00a0\nFrom:\n\u00a0Randi Mooney <\nrmooney@diligent.com\n>\nSent:\n\u00a0Thursday, February 20, 2025 1:49 PM\nTo:\n\u00a0Catalina De Sanctis <\nc.desanctis@lcwmail.com\n>\nCc:\n\u00a0Brian Luong <\nbluong@diligent.com\n>; Don Reyes <\ndreyes@diligent.com\n>; Karen Lai <\nklai@diligent.com\n>; Kumud Mishra <\nkmishra@diligent.com\n>; Jorgelina Venturi <\nj.venturi@lcwmail.com\n>\nSubject:\n\u00a0Re: Diligent - WO_DELMONTE_COC_080624 - Del Monte CoC\n\u00a0\nHello,\n\u00a0\nDel Monte will be following up with their LMS on this matter.

This method involves the least amount of scope increase since we're at the translation phase. See below for what I did to the package to relay to them. Then can use the Menu to skip to the Certification slide to test both clickable decisions.\n\u00a0\n<image019.png>\n\u00a0\nOn the screen below, when the learner selects the No, the course will complete when the final slide loads. If the learner selects Yes, then the course will register as incomplete when reaching the final slide. \nIf this is not enough for them, please have Del Monte describe how they are going to mitigate this issue for themselves internally with the limitations of their LMS, and we can adjust the package accordingly. \nSince their LMS doesn't allow the reportage they want, they need to decide how they are going to reach out to people who appear incomplete if this isn't good enough. That may even need to include adding language to the course that would then need translation. Reconfiguration/Testing of the course for numerical scores to be sent to signal the selected response in question, would take 1hr per language to adjust totaling $1400 ($140*10lg) additional to the scope on my end. The adjustment I did here would only increase the scope between $140-$280 overall to apply the fix.\n<image020.png>\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\nPlease let us know your comments.\nThanks!\nCDS\n\u00a0\nCatalina De Sanctis\nTranslation Specialist\nLCW\n<image021.png>\n\u00a0\nWebsite\n\u00a0| \nTwitter\n\u00a0| \nFacebook\n\u00a0| \nLinkedIn\nView our upcoming events\n\u00a0| \nSign-up for our newsletter\n\u00a0\nFrom:\n\u00a0Randi Mooney <\nrmooney@diligent.com\n>\nSent:\n\u00a0Tuesday, February 11, 2025 2:31 PM\nTo:\n\u00a0Catalina De Sanctis <\nc.desanctis@lcwmail.com\n>\nCc:\n\u00a0Brian Luong <\nbluong@diligent.com\n>; Don Reyes <\ndreyes@diligent.com\n>; Karen Lai <\nklai@diligent.com\n>; Kumud Mishra <\nkmishra@diligent.com\n>\nSubject:\n\u00a0Re: Diligent - WO_DELMONTE_COC_080624 - Del Monte CoC\n\u00a0\nHi Catalina,\n\u00a0\nI wanted to follow up to see if Dustin's new test file for Del Monte is ready?

But in the meantime, sent over an invite for Friday.\n\u00a0\nHere is a summary of the situation:\nDel Monte noted earlier this week that the SCORM 2004 test file worked well in their LMS but followed up asking if we could send them their test report.\nWe informed them that without explicit access to their LMS and metadata, it would not be possible to generate a report on their behalf.\nThey replied that their LMS does not allow for any reports to be exported. This is where the misunderstanding occurred.\nEarlier in the project, it was interpreted that they were not getting the desired information from SCORM 1.2 completion reports. That is why we decided to proceed with SCORM 2004 as it allows for customized reportage.\nWe have asked Del Monte to confirm with their LMS, Convercent, what type of reports or metadata can be generated or exported. Awaiting a response here.\nQuestions to discuss:\nIs there any way to run a report on behalf\u00a0of Del Monte?\nHave reporting capabilities been brought up in the prior year updates for Del Monte? If so, what was the recommendation?\nThanks!\n_________________________\nDiligent\nRandi Mooney (Doran),\n\u00a0she/her\nAdvisory Specialist II, Advisory & Consulting Services\nrmooney@diligent.com\n\u00a0| \ndiligent.com\n\u00a0\nFrom:\n\u00a0Catalina De Sanctis <\nc.desanctis@lcwmail.com\n>\nSent:\n\u00a0Wednesday, January 29, 2025 7:23 PM\nTo:\n\u00a0Randi Mooney <\nrmooney@diligent.com\n>; Brian Luong <\nbluong@diligent.com\n>\nCc:\n\u00a0Don Reyes <\ndreyes@diligent.com\n>; Karen Lai <\nklai@diligent.com\n>; Kumud Mishra <\nkmishra@diligent.com\n>\nSubject:\n\u00a0RE: Diligent - WO_DELMONTE_COC_080624 - Del Monte CoC\n\u00a0\nHello Randi,\nIm sorry, tomorrow is complicated.

If you need something from me, please email me\n \nI think we should keep our \ncall with Diligent on Tues\n, even if we don't have anything open. I want them to know we are committed to them & available to them.\n \nSure thing, I thought they only needed us if anything in progress\nI think you should still send the\n\u00a0Excel doc/summary\n\u00a0to the Diligent team on Monday (or prior to the Tues call) and list anything that has been recently completed or is outstanding. For example, this GXO Quote is s\ntill awaiting a response from Diligent/GXO \nhttps://lcw.scoro.com/quotes/view/1565\n.\u00a0\nIs there any quote im not awaere of? Ill share it on Monday for sure!\nDustin lateness\n\u00a0- regarding him being late with the last project... \nIt would be great if we could be more proactive with Diligent. For example, if you see that Dustin is late, proactively reach out to him to find out what's going on & then report back to the client \nbefore \nthey have the chance to follow up with us \n\ud83d\ude42\n. \nI'd rather us reach out first to explain the delay than them coming to us.\n \nYou are right, keep this in mind\nDustin processes\n\u00a0- up to you, but just a thought... \nMaybe it would be easier for Dustin to create the process docs first, and then you have a chat with him to discuss?? Again, this is totally up to you. I'm just thinking that maybe that would be better than you writing everything up. You could give him 1 process to do (like Diligent Code of Conduct), review it, re-work the formatting, make sure if has everything you need, talk to him about it... And then once the format is agreed upon & he understands what info he needs to give you, then he can do the other docs.\nI'm not trying to micromanage here... It really is just a suggestion. But feel free to do it however you want. \nI may not be able to join the calls bc my schedule has been crazy\n! I agree, I need to understand what he does because im still lost there ill reach out to him now and cc you there.\nI did not forget about \nonboarding docs for translators\n. \nWill look at that by next week. \nWill try to get to it this morning.\n \nNo rush on this!!\n\u00a0\nLMK if you have any questions/thoughts.\nThank you Cecilia!\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\nNicole Barile\n\u00a0\n(She/Her)\nChief Operating Officer\nLCW\n\u00a0\nWebsite\n\u00a0\n|\n\u00a0\nTwitter\n\u00a0\n|\n\u00a0\nFacebook\n\u00a0\n|\n\u00a0\nLinkedIn\nView our upcoming events\n\u00a0| \nSign-up for our newsletter",

We can adjust the\u00a0package to give them scores or try to adapt to their system of distinguishing learners with such limited LMS reporting features. But as shown with our testing, the packages have worked and we'll need their LMS to send us the exact settings that will be needed to accompany Del Monte's method of how they plan to distinguish learners who said Yes or No on the questionnaire.\u00a0\n\u00a0\nPerhaps their system only shows a complete pass/fail scenario? We'd need guidance from their LMS on how scores are captured and if it can distinguish a 50% score that \"fails\" but still passes the course.\u00a0\n\u00a0\nPlease note our so long back and forth comes from their limiting system and as you can notice we are flexible and doing our best to help them get what they need.\nPlease let us know.\nWe are happy to help.\nBest,\nCDS\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\nCatalina De Sanctis\nTranslation Specialist\nLCW\n<image003.png>\n\u00a0\nWebsite\n\u00a0| \nTwitter\n\u00a0| \nFacebook\n\u00a0| \nLinkedIn\nView our upcoming events\n\u00a0| \nSign-up for our newsletter\n\u00a0\nFrom:\n\u00a0Randi Mooney <rmooney@diligent.com>\nSent:\n\u00a0Thursday, February 20, 2025 1:49 PM\nTo:\n\u00a0Catalina De Sanctis <c.desanctis@lcwmail.com>\nCc:\n\u00a0Brian Luong <bluong@diligent.com>; Don Reyes <dreyes@diligent.com>; Karen Lai <klai@diligent.com>; Kumud Mishra <kmishra@diligent.com>; Jorgelina Venturi <j.venturi@lcwmail.com>\nSubject:\n\u00a0Re: Diligent - WO_DELMONTE_COC_080624 - Del Monte CoC\n\u00a0\nHello,\n\u00a0\nDel Monte will be following up with their LMS on this matter.

This method involves the least amount of scope increase since we're at the translation phase. See below for what I did to the package to relay to them. Then can use the Menu to skip to the Certification slide to test both clickable decisions.\n\u00a0\n<image019.png>\n\u00a0\nOn the screen below, when the learner selects the No, the course will complete when the final slide loads. If the learner selects Yes, then the course will register as incomplete when reaching the final slide. \nIf this is not enough for them, please have Del Monte describe how they are going to mitigate this issue for themselves internally with the limitations of their LMS, and we can adjust the package accordingly. \nSince their LMS doesn't allow the reportage they want, they need to decide how they are going to reach out to people who appear incomplete if this isn't good enough. That may even need to include adding language to the course that would then need translation. Reconfiguration/Testing of the course for numerical scores to be sent to signal the selected response in question, would take 1hr per language to adjust totaling $1400 ($140*10lg) additional to the scope on my end. The adjustment I did here would only increase the scope between $140-$280 overall to apply the fix.\n<image020.png>\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\nPlease let us know your comments.\nThanks!\nCDS\n\u00a0\nCatalina De Sanctis\nTranslation Specialist\nLCW\n<image021.png>\n\u00a0\nWebsite\n\u00a0| \nTwitter\n\u00a0| \nFacebook\n\u00a0| \nLinkedIn\nView our upcoming events\n\u00a0| \nSign-up for our newsletter\n\u00a0\nFrom:\n\u00a0Randi Mooney <\nrmooney@diligent.com\n>\nSent:\n\u00a0Tuesday, February 11, 2025 2:31 PM\nTo:\n\u00a0Catalina De Sanctis <\nc.desanctis@lcwmail.com\n>\nCc:\n\u00a0Brian Luong <\nbluong@diligent.com\n>; Don Reyes <\ndreyes@diligent.com\n>; Karen Lai <\nklai@diligent.com\n>; Kumud Mishra <\nkmishra@diligent.com\n>\nSubject:\n\u00a0Re: Diligent - WO_DELMONTE_COC_080624 - Del Monte CoC\n\u00a0\nHi Catalina,\n\u00a0\nI wanted to follow up to see if Dustin's new test file for Del Monte is ready?

But in the meantime, sent over an invite for Friday.\n\u00a0\nHere is a summary of the situation:\nDel Monte noted earlier this week that the SCORM 2004 test file worked well in their LMS but followed up asking if we could send them their test report.\nWe informed them that without explicit access to their LMS and metadata, it would not be possible to generate a report on their behalf.\nThey replied that their LMS does not allow for any reports to be exported. This is where the misunderstanding occurred.\nEarlier in the project, it was interpreted that they were not getting the desired information from SCORM 1.2 completion reports. That is why we decided to proceed with SCORM 2004 as it allows for customized reportage.\nWe have asked Del Monte to confirm with their LMS, Convercent, what type of reports or metadata can be generated or exported. Awaiting a response here.\nQuestions to discuss:\nIs there any way to run a report on behalf\u00a0of Del Monte?\nHave reporting capabilities been brought up in the prior year updates for Del Monte? If so, what was the recommendation?\nThanks!\n_________________________\nDiligent\nRandi Mooney (Doran),\n\u00a0she/her\nAdvisory Specialist II, Advisory & Consulting Services\nrmooney@diligent.com\n\u00a0| \ndiligent.com\n\u00a0\nFrom:\n\u00a0Catalina De Sanctis <\nc.desanctis@lcwmail.com\n>\nSent:\n\u00a0Wednesday, January 29, 2025 7:23 PM\nTo:\n\u00a0Randi Mooney <\nrmooney@diligent.com\n>; Brian Luong <\nbluong@diligent.com\n>\nCc:\n\u00a0Don Reyes <\ndreyes@diligent.com\n>; Karen Lai <\nklai@diligent.com\n>; Kumud Mishra <\nkmishra@diligent.com\n>\nSubject:\n\u00a0RE: Diligent - WO_DELMONTE_COC_080624 - Del Monte CoC\n\u00a0\nHello Randi,\nIm sorry, tomorrow is complicated.

    "body": "Hi Cecilia,\nHappy Friday!\nA few notes:\nI will be \nout of the office\n\u00a0this afternoon & Monday, but I will check emails. If you need something from me, please email me\nI think we should keep our \ncall with Diligent on Tues\n, even if we don't have anything open. I want them to know we are committed to them & available to them.\nI think you should still send the\n\u00a0Excel doc/summary\n\u00a0to the Diligent team on Monday (or prior to the Tues call) and list anything that has been recently completed or is outstanding. For example, this GXO Quote is still awaiting a response from Diligent/GXO \nhttps://lcw.scoro.com/quotes/view/1565\n.\u00a0\nDustin lateness\n\u00a0- regarding him being late with the last project... It would be great if we could be more proactive with Diligent. For example, if you see that Dustin is late, proactively reach out to him to find out what's going on & then report back to the client \nbefore \nthey have the chance to follow up with us \ud83d\ude42. I'd rather us reach out first to explain the delay than them coming to us.\nDustin processes\n\u00a0- up to you, but just a thought... Maybe it would be easier for Dustin to create the process docs first, and then you have a chat with him to discuss?? Again, this is totally up to you. I'm just thinking that maybe that would be better than you writing everything up. You could give him 1 process to do (like Diligent Code of Conduct), review it, re-work the formatting, make sure if has everything you need, talk to him about it... And then once the format is agreed upon & he understands what info he needs to give you, then he can do the other docs.\nI'm not trying to micromanage here... It really is just a suggestion. But feel free to do it however you want. I may not be able to join the calls bc my schedule has been crazy!\nI did not forget about \nonboarding docs for translators\n. Will look at that by next week. Will try to get to it this morning.\nLMK if you have any questions/thoughts.\nThank you Cecilia!\nNicole Barile\n\u00a0\n(She/Her)\nChief Operating Officer\nLCW\nWebsite\n\u00a0\n|\n\u00a0\nTwitter\n\u00a0\n|\n\u00a0\nFacebook\n\u00a0\n|\n\u00a0\nLinkedIn\nView our upcoming events\n\u00a0| \nSign-up for our newsletter",
