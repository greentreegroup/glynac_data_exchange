There must be a misunderstanding here because I was quoted $1300 per language to get the deck fully translated (no speaker notes, just the slides plus the video subtitling).

I\u2019m speaking with Chuck and Nicole about allowing that, as long as we are able to QA the translation and approve them, keeping the integrity of the content and our intellectual property. \n\u00a0\nHow much would we typically charge a client to QA the Spanish (LatAm) and Portuguese (Brazil) translations for: \nThis PPT\n (video on slide 3 which has script in the speaker notes) and\nThis PPT\n: \nSlide 19: Video: \n\u00bfM\u00e9xico e racista o colorista?\u201d\u00a0\n \n(which came from \nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5fgOrV2uJUU\n) \n\u2013 video is on Spanish, so only needed to translate into PTB\nSlide 22: Video: \n\u00a0\u201cIndigenas Urbanos: Los desafios de los pueblos indigenas en ciudades\n\u201d (which came from \nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bl9viILCREM\n) \n\u2013 \nvideo is on Spanish, so only needed to translate into PTB\nSlide 30: Video: \u201cA Class Divided\u201d (see attached for script). \nThis video is located \nhere\n (in our Dropbox) but we only need until 8:42 (\u201c\u2026it\u2019s a horrid day\u201d). Even when I download the video from the workshop deck (which is 8:42) it provides me with the longer 13:25 version!\nThere is also a Quiz on Zoom which would also need translation (see attached for English).\n\u00a0\nWe\u2019d be QAing \nthe slides only (not the speaker notes\n, they will not translate those) and the \nvideos would need subtitles only\n. \n\u00a0\nAnd how much do we typically pay reviewers to do this?\n\u00a0\nGracias!\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\nRebecca M.

There must be a misunderstanding here because I was quoted $1300 per language to get the deck fully translated (no speaker notes, just the slides plus the video subtitling). Please see attached email thread with Catalina. \n\u00a0\nSo the client is definitely expecting the cost to be less than $1300 per language. If you\u2019d like we can get on a call to clarify the project? I\u2019d want to know why QAing work done by our client would cost more than doing a straight translation. \u00a0\n\u00a0\nThanks!\nRebecca\n\u00a0\nRebecca M.

We were able to modify the XML code to remove the year, but when we updated the course for this year the code reverted. For us to make an update that would 100% fix this issue, we need the source file and not the unlocked published SCORM file.\"\n\u00a0\nIs someone from your team able to explain the difference between source files in this instance and unlocked SCORMs?

There must be a misunderstanding here because I was quoted $1300 per language to get the deck fully translated (no speaker notes, just the slides plus the video subtitling).

Even when I download the video from the workshop deck (which is 8:42) it provides me with the longer 13:25 version!\nThere is also a Quiz on Zoom which would also need translation (see attached for English).\n\u00a0\nWe\u2019d be QAing \nthe slides only (not the speaker notes\n, they will not translate those) and the \nvideos would need subtitles only\n. \n\u00a0\nAnd how much do we typically pay reviewers to do this?\n\u00a0\nGracias!\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\nRebecca M.

There must be a misunderstanding here because I was quoted $1300 per language to get the deck fully translated (no speaker notes, just the slides plus the video subtitling). Please see attached email thread with Catalina. \n\u00a0\nSo the client is definitely expecting the cost to be less than $1300 per language. If you\u2019d like we can get on a call to clarify the project? I\u2019d want to know why QAing work done by our client would cost more than doing a straight translation. \u00a0\n\u00a0\nThanks!\nRebecca\n\u00a0\nRebecca M.

As a reminder of any meetings that happen outside of that time frame, I will do my best\u00a0 to adjust my time online to accommodate that meeting since my hours are limited.\nFor example, if there's an hour meeting at 3pm EST then my hours would be 8am EST-11am\u00a0EST or 9am EST -12pm EST and I will log back in to attend the meeting at 3pm EST.\u00a0\nAny one-on-one meetings will be ad hoc.\u00a0\n\u00a0\nAs always if you need to reach me regarding an urgent need that cannot wait or be delegated you can reach me on WhatsApp: 703-504-8519\nAnd text at\u00a06572240067.\n\u00a0\nIf you need me to be available online at later times on a particular day, please reach out to me and I will work with you.\u00a0\nThanks!\nJuri Mansour (She/Her)\nConsultant Project Associate\nLCW\nFrom:\n Juri Mansour\nSent:\n Friday, January 24, 2025 4:05 AM\nTo:\n Andrea Wicks Bowles <a.wicksbowles@lcwmail.com>; Patricia Coleman <p.coleman@lcwmail.com>; Rebecca Parrilla <r.parrilla@lcwmail.com>; Larry Baker <l.baker@lcwmail.com>; Chuck Adams <c.adams@lcwmail.com>; Catalina De Sanctis <c.desanctis@lcwmail.com>; Kaitlin Nonweiler <k.nonweiler@lcwmail.com>\nCc:\n Nicole Barile <n.barile@lcwmail.com>\nSubject:\n Upcoming Online Availability Changes\n \n\u00a0\nHello team,\nToday going forward I will be limited in being online on Tuesdays and Fridays with hours being 8-11 am EST. The rest of the days I'll be online from 8am-12pm EST. \u00a0Tuesday's schedule is temporary just for the next month. I will let you know if that changes.\nI will be flexible on days that client meetings must happen outside of these hours and adjust those days online availability to accommodate those meetings.\u00a0\nAny one-on-one meetings will be ad hoc.\u00a0\nAs always if you need to reach me regarding an urgent need that cannot wait or be delegated you can reach me on WhatsApp: 703-504-8519\nAnd text at\u00a06572240067.\nIf you need me to be available online at later times in a day, please reach out to me and I will work with you.\u00a0\nI am still sick with my respiratory system being mainly affected. I have never been this sick so I would appreciate your patience with me. I am functional though my ability to speak will be limited until I recover more hopefully sooner rather than later.\u00a0I will reserve my speaking for client meetings and on rest of meetings I will reply in chat unless absolutely necessary to speak.\nThank you for your understanding & patience.

Either option would just be a 2 day turnaround on my end once approved.\nThe source file gives any of their clients the ability to have the file and the entire design to do what they want with. That would be up to Diligent if it works with their pay model and if it doesn't put them at risk of the client then being able to update on their own moving forward.\nLet me know if you need any other language for the client.\nBest,\nDustin\nBest,\nDustin\nOn Thu, Apr 3, 2025, 1:00\u202fPM Cecilia Mariotta <\nc.mariotta@lcwmail.com\n> wrote:\nHello Dustin,\n\u00a0\nI hope you are doing great today!\n\u00a0\nWe need you to provide a quote and TAT for the following:\n\u00a0\nCardinal Health would like to make a minor update to their Standard of Business Course.

We had provided them with the unlocked SCORMS, but they provided the following commentary recently: \"We did not receive the source files. We received the unlocked published SCORM files. We were able to modify the XML code to remove the year, but when we updated the course for this year the code reverted. For us to make an update that would 100% fix this issue, we need the source file and not the unlocked published SCORM file.\"\n\u00a0\nIs someone from your team able to explain the difference between source files in this instance and unlocked SCORMs? Or confirm that the customer should be able to make adjustments to the year on their own?

There must be a misunderstanding here because I was quoted $1300 per language to get the deck fully translated (no speaker notes, just the slides plus the video subtitling).

If you\u2019d like we can get on a call to clarify the project?

No rush, but I need your help with the onboarding of new translators.\n\u00a0\nCan you look at the attached \"Translator-Interpreter Profile\" doc & lmk if you would need to send this to new translators you hire? It looks like a way to capture their bank info (which SG could get off their invoice or other ways). And, it looks like it helps you track their rates. Let me know if you think you need to use this doc and/or make any\u00a0changes to it.\n\u00a0\nI've also attached an email template I'm putting\u00a0together that you could s\nend to new translators to get what you need in terms of paperwork. I added a bunch of things in red I'm still working on. What else would you want to include in this doc? Do you need to share info about Trados here or anything else? Feel free to edit the doc.\n\u00a0\nI've also attached the updated Translator Agreement I am working on. Sending more of an FYI.\n\u00a0\nI know this is a lot. It's not a rush as I said. I'm just trying to help get you everything you need to send to new translators.\n\u00a0\nHappy to talk on thee phone about this another time too if easier.\n\u00a0\nThanks!\nFrom:\n Accounting <\naccounting@lcwmail.com\n>\nSent:\n Tuesday, April 1, 2025 6:01 PM\nTo:\n Nicole Barile <\nn.barile@lcwmail.com\n>\nCc:\n Cecilia Mariotta <\nc.mariotta@lcwmail.com\n>\nSubject:\n RE: Invoicing language in Translator Agreement\n \n\u00a0\nHi Nicole,\n\u00a0\nSo the way we currently pay vendors, in order of preference, is:\n\u00a0\nACH to a US bank account\nPayPal\n(international wire, but the service we use is currently unavailable due to their vendor issues \u2013 I am looking into other options)\n\u00a0\nWe don\u2019t send physical checks anymore, it\u2019s electronic only.

Thank you!\n\u00a0\n6.5. \u00a0LCW shall pay the Translator with a check drawn on a US bank (or with PayPal, if so requested by the translator) in US dollars (US$), within 30 days of receiving the invoice, unless agreed upon otherwise by both LCW and the Translator. All bank and processing fees for receiving the money are the responsibility of the translator.\n\u00a0\n6.6. \u00a0The Translator \nmay \nrequest payment via electronic funds transfer (wire transfer).

For lesser amounts, the wire transfer may be requested by discounting the invoice by US$35.00 for international transfers and US$25 for domestic (US) transfers (the charge LCW incurs by initiating the wire transfer).\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\nNicole Barile\n\u00a0\n(She/Her)\nChief Operating Officer\nLCW\n\u00a0\nWebsite\n\u00a0\n|\n\u00a0\nTwitter\n\u00a0\n|\n\u00a0\nFacebook\n\u00a0\n|\n\u00a0\nLinkedIn\nView our upcoming events\n\u00a0| \nSign-up for our newsletter",

No rush, but I need your help with the onboarding of new translators.\n\u00a0\nCan you look at the attached \"Translator-Interpreter Profile\" doc & lmk if you would need to send this to new translators you hire? It looks like a way to capture their bank info (which SG could get off their invoice or other ways). And, it looks like it helps you track their rates. Let me know if you think you need to use this doc and/or make any\u00a0changes to it.\n\u00a0\nI've also attached an email template I'm putting\u00a0together that you could s\nend to new translators to get what you need in terms of paperwork. I added a bunch of things in red I'm still working on. What else would you want to include in this doc? Do you need to share info about Trados here or anything else? Feel free to edit the doc.\n\u00a0\nI've also attached the updated Translator Agreement I am working on. Sending more of an FYI.\n\u00a0\nI know this is a lot. It's not a rush as I said. I'm just trying to help get you everything you need to send to new translators.\n\u00a0\nHappy to talk on thee phone about this another time too if easier.\n\u00a0\nThanks!\nFrom:\n Accounting <\naccounting@lcwmail.com\n>\nSent:\n Tuesday, April 1, 2025 6:01 PM\nTo:\n Nicole Barile <\nn.barile@lcwmail.com\n>\nCc:\n Cecilia Mariotta <\nc.mariotta@lcwmail.com\n>\nSubject:\n RE: Invoicing language in Translator Agreement\n \n\u00a0\nHi Nicole,\n\u00a0\nSo the way we currently pay vendors, in order of preference, is:\n\u00a0\nACH to a US bank account\nPayPal\n(international wire, but the service we use is currently unavailable due to their vendor issues \u2013 I am looking into other options)\n\u00a0\nWe don\u2019t send physical checks anymore, it\u2019s electronic only. For US bank accounts, I need the vendor to provide an email address, and then I will send them an invite to create a QuickBooks Money account to manage their information (or send me routing & account).

When you get a sec, can you please lmk if the below is still appropriate? I'm updating our Translation Agreement & think the below might be out of date. Thank you!\n\u00a0\n6.5. \u00a0LCW shall pay the Translator with a check drawn on a US bank (or with PayPal, if so requested by the translator) in US dollars (US$), within 30 days of receiving the invoice, unless agreed upon otherwise by both LCW and the Translator. All bank and processing fees for receiving the money are the responsibility of the translator.\n\u00a0\n6.6. \u00a0The Translator \nmay \nrequest payment via electronic funds transfer (wire transfer). In cases where the invoice amount exceeds US$1000.00, LCW will pay the outgoing wire transfer fees. For lesser amounts, the wire transfer may be requested by discounting the invoice by US$35.00 for international transfers and US$25 for domestic (US) transfers (the charge LCW incurs by initiating the wire transfer).\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\nNicole Barile\n\u00a0\n(She/Her)\nChief Operating Officer\nLCW\n\u00a0\nWebsite\n\u00a0\n|\n\u00a0\nTwitter\n\u00a0\n|\n\u00a0\nFacebook\n\u00a0\n|\n\u00a0\nLinkedIn\nView our upcoming events\n\u00a0| \nSign-up for our newsletter",

    "body": "Hi. No rush, but I need your help with the onboarding of new translators.\nCan you look at the attached \"Translator-Interpreter Profile\" doc & lmk if you would need to send this to new translators you hire? It looks like a way to capture their bank info (which SG could get off their invoice or other ways). And, it looks like it helps you track their rates. Let me know if you think you need to use this doc and/or make any\u00a0changes to it.\nI've also attached an email template I'm putting\u00a0together that you could send to new translators to get what you need in terms of paperwork. I added a bunch of things in red I'm still working on. What else would you want to include in this doc? Do you need to share info about Trados here or anything else? Feel free to edit the doc.\nI've also attached the updated Translator Agreement I am working on. Sending more of an FYI.\nI know this is a lot. It's not a rush as I said. I'm just trying to help get you everything you need to send to new translators.\nHappy to talk on thee phone about this another time too if easier.\nThanks!\nFrom:\n Accounting <accounting@lcwmail.com>\nSent:\n Tuesday, April 1, 2025 6:01 PM\nTo:\n Nicole Barile <n.barile@lcwmail.com>\nCc:\n Cecilia Mariotta <c.mariotta@lcwmail.com>\nSubject:\n RE: Invoicing language in Translator Agreement\n \n\u00a0\nHi Nicole,\n\u00a0\nSo the way we currently pay vendors, in order of preference, is:\n\u00a0\nACH to a US bank account\nPayPal\n(international wire, but the service we use is currently unavailable due to their vendor issues \u2013 I am looking into other options)\n\u00a0\nWe don\u2019t send physical checks anymore, it\u2019s electronic only. For US bank accounts, I need the vendor to provide an email address, and then I will send them an invite to create a QuickBooks Money account to manage their information (or send me routing & account). PayPal they just need to give me the email.\n\u00a0\nHope this is helpful, let me know if you need anything else \n\ud83d\ude0a\n\u00a0\nSG\n\u00a0\nFrom:\n Nicole Barile <n.barile@lcwmail.com> \nSent:\n Monday, March 31, 2025 16:01\nTo:\n Accounting <accounting@lcwmail.com>\nCc:\n Cecilia Mariotta <c.mariotta@lcwmail.com>\nSubject:\n Re: Invoicing language in Translator Agreement\n\u00a0\nHI again SG. I also found this old form (attached) that it seems we used to send to translators to get their banking info / payment preferences. Again, no rush, but can you also check if the attached is needed? Or maybe parts are needed or things need to be updated?\n\u00a0\nThanks again!\nFrom:\n Nicole Barile\nSent:\n Monday, March 31, 2025 12:15 PM\nTo:\n Accounting <\naccounting@lcwmail.com\n>\nCc:\n Cecilia Mariotta <\nc.mariotta@lcwmail.com\n>\nSubject:\n Invoicing language in Translator Agreement\n \n\u00a0\nHi SG.\n\u00a0\nNo rush on this.... When you get a sec, can you please lmk if the below is still appropriate? I'm updating our Translation Agreement & think the below might be out of date. Thank you!\n\u00a0\n6.5. \u00a0LCW shall pay the Translator with a check drawn on a US bank (or with PayPal, if so requested by the translator) in US dollars (US$), within 30 days of receiving the invoice, unless agreed upon otherwise by both LCW and the Translator. All bank and processing fees for receiving the money are the responsibility of the translator.\n\u00a0\n6.6. \u00a0The Translator \nmay \nrequest payment via electronic funds transfer (wire transfer). In cases where the invoice amount exceeds US$1000.00, LCW will pay the outgoing wire transfer fees. For lesser amounts, the wire transfer may be requested by discounting the invoice by US$35.00 for international transfers and US$25 for domestic (US) transfers (the charge LCW incurs by initiating the wire transfer).\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\nNicole Barile\n\u00a0\n(She/Her)\nChief Operating Officer\nLCW\n\u00a0\nWebsite\n\u00a0\n|\n\u00a0\nTwitter\n\u00a0\n|\n\u00a0\nFacebook\n\u00a0\n|\n\u00a0\nLinkedIn\nView our upcoming events\n\u00a0| \nSign-up for our newsletter",

We can adjust the\u00a0package to give them scores or try to adapt to their system of distinguishing learners with such limited LMS reporting features. But as shown with our testing, the packages have worked and we'll need their LMS to send us the exact settings that will be needed to accompany Del Monte's method of how they plan to distinguish learners who said Yes or No on the questionnaire.\u00a0\n\u00a0\nPerhaps their system only shows a complete pass/fail scenario? We'd need guidance from their LMS on how scores are captured and if it can distinguish a 50% score that \"fails\" but still passes the course.\u00a0\n\u00a0\nPlease note our so long back and forth comes from their limiting system and as you can notice we are flexible and doing our best to help them get what they need.\nPlease let us know.\nWe are happy to help.\nBest,\nCDS\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\nCatalina De Sanctis\nTranslation Specialist\nLCW\n<image003.png>\n\u00a0\nWebsite\n\u00a0| \nTwitter\n\u00a0| \nFacebook\n\u00a0| \nLinkedIn\nView our upcoming events\n\u00a0| \nSign-up for our newsletter\n\u00a0\nFrom:\n\u00a0Randi Mooney <\nrmooney@diligent.com\n>\nSent:\n\u00a0Thursday, February 20, 2025 1:49 PM\nTo:\n\u00a0Catalina De Sanctis <\nc.desanctis@lcwmail.com\n>\nCc:\n\u00a0Brian Luong <\nbluong@diligent.com\n>; Don Reyes <\ndreyes@diligent.com\n>; Karen Lai <\nklai@diligent.com\n>; Kumud Mishra <\nkmishra@diligent.com\n>; Jorgelina Venturi <\nj.venturi@lcwmail.com\n>\nSubject:\n\u00a0Re: Diligent - WO_DELMONTE_COC_080624 - Del Monte CoC\n\u00a0\nHello,\n\u00a0\nDel Monte will be following up with their LMS on this matter.

This method involves the least amount of scope increase since we're at the translation phase. See below for what I did to the package to relay to them. Then can use the Menu to skip to the Certification slide to test both clickable decisions.\n\u00a0\n<image019.png>\n\u00a0\nOn the screen below, when the learner selects the No, the course will complete when the final slide loads. If the learner selects Yes, then the course will register as incomplete when reaching the final slide. \nIf this is not enough for them, please have Del Monte describe how they are going to mitigate this issue for themselves internally with the limitations of their LMS, and we can adjust the package accordingly. \nSince their LMS doesn't allow the reportage they want, they need to decide how they are going to reach out to people who appear incomplete if this isn't good enough. That may even need to include adding language to the course that would then need translation. Reconfiguration/Testing of the course for numerical scores to be sent to signal the selected response in question, would take 1hr per language to adjust totaling $1400 ($140*10lg) additional to the scope on my end. The adjustment I did here would only increase the scope between $140-$280 overall to apply the fix.\n<image020.png>\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\nPlease let us know your comments.\nThanks!\nCDS\n\u00a0\nCatalina De Sanctis\nTranslation Specialist\nLCW\n<image021.png>\n\u00a0\nWebsite\n\u00a0| \nTwitter\n\u00a0| \nFacebook\n\u00a0| \nLinkedIn\nView our upcoming events\n\u00a0| \nSign-up for our newsletter\n\u00a0\nFrom:\n\u00a0Randi Mooney <\nrmooney@diligent.com\n>\nSent:\n\u00a0Tuesday, February 11, 2025 2:31 PM\nTo:\n\u00a0Catalina De Sanctis <\nc.desanctis@lcwmail.com\n>\nCc:\n\u00a0Brian Luong <\nbluong@diligent.com\n>; Don Reyes <\ndreyes@diligent.com\n>; Karen Lai <\nklai@diligent.com\n>; Kumud Mishra <\nkmishra@diligent.com\n>\nSubject:\n\u00a0Re: Diligent - WO_DELMONTE_COC_080624 - Del Monte CoC\n\u00a0\nHi Catalina,\n\u00a0\nI wanted to follow up to see if Dustin's new test file for Del Monte is ready?

But in the meantime, sent over an invite for Friday.\n\u00a0\nHere is a summary of the situation:\nDel Monte noted earlier this week that the SCORM 2004 test file worked well in their LMS but followed up asking if we could send them their test report.\nWe informed them that without explicit access to their LMS and metadata, it would not be possible to generate a report on their behalf.\nThey replied that their LMS does not allow for any reports to be exported. This is where the misunderstanding occurred.\nEarlier in the project, it was interpreted that they were not getting the desired information from SCORM 1.2 completion reports. That is why we decided to proceed with SCORM 2004 as it allows for customized reportage.\nWe have asked Del Monte to confirm with their LMS, Convercent, what type of reports or metadata can be generated or exported. Awaiting a response here.\nQuestions to discuss:\nIs there any way to run a report on behalf\u00a0of Del Monte?\nHave reporting capabilities been brought up in the prior year updates for Del Monte? If so, what was the recommendation?\nThanks!\n_________________________\nDiligent\nRandi Mooney (Doran),\n\u00a0she/her\nAdvisory Specialist II, Advisory & Consulting Services\nrmooney@diligent.com\n\u00a0| \ndiligent.com\n\u00a0\nFrom:\n\u00a0Catalina De Sanctis <\nc.desanctis@lcwmail.com\n>\nSent:\n\u00a0Wednesday, January 29, 2025 7:23 PM\nTo:\n\u00a0Randi Mooney <\nrmooney@diligent.com\n>; Brian Luong <\nbluong@diligent.com\n>\nCc:\n\u00a0Don Reyes <\ndreyes@diligent.com\n>; Karen Lai <\nklai@diligent.com\n>; Kumud Mishra <\nkmishra@diligent.com\n>\nSubject:\n\u00a0RE: Diligent - WO_DELMONTE_COC_080624 - Del Monte CoC\n\u00a0\nHello Randi,\nIm sorry, tomorrow is complicated.

We can adjust the\u00a0package to give them scores or try to adapt to their system of distinguishing learners with such limited LMS reporting features. But as shown with our testing, the packages have worked and we'll need their LMS to send us the exact settings that will be needed to accompany Del Monte's method of how they plan to distinguish learners who said Yes or No on the questionnaire.\u00a0\n\u00a0\nPerhaps their system only shows a complete pass/fail scenario? We'd need guidance from their LMS on how scores are captured and if it can distinguish a 50% score that \"fails\" but still passes the course.\u00a0\n\u00a0\nPlease note our so long back and forth comes from their limiting system and as you can notice we are flexible and doing our best to help them get what they need.\nPlease let us know.\nWe are happy to help.\nBest,\nCDS\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\nCatalina De Sanctis\nTranslation Specialist\nLCW\n<image003.png>\n\u00a0\nWebsite\n\u00a0| \nTwitter\n\u00a0| \nFacebook\n\u00a0| \nLinkedIn\nView our upcoming events\n\u00a0| \nSign-up for our newsletter\n\u00a0\nFrom:\n\u00a0Randi Mooney <\nrmooney@diligent.com\n>\nSent:\n\u00a0Thursday, February 20, 2025 1:49 PM\nTo:\n\u00a0Catalina De Sanctis <\nc.desanctis@lcwmail.com\n>\nCc:\n\u00a0Brian Luong <\nbluong@diligent.com\n>; Don Reyes <\ndreyes@diligent.com\n>; Karen Lai <\nklai@diligent.com\n>; Kumud Mishra <\nkmishra@diligent.com\n>; Jorgelina Venturi <\nj.venturi@lcwmail.com\n>\nSubject:\n\u00a0Re: Diligent - WO_DELMONTE_COC_080624 - Del Monte CoC\n\u00a0\nHello,\n\u00a0\nDel Monte will be following up with their LMS on this matter.

The issue we have is that we can't distinguish all blank scores that are incomplete, and we don't know if in fact they completed the course. We could even be ok with a blank score if the participant was able to complete the course.\n\u00a0\nThanks,\n_________________________\nDiligent\nRandi Mooney,\n\u00a0she/her\nAdvisory Specialist II, Advisory & Consulting Services\nrmooney@diligent.com\n\u00a0| \ndiligent.com\n\u00a0\nUpcoming PTO: February 20th - February 25th\n\u00a0\nFrom:\n\u00a0Catalina De Sanctis <\nc.desanctis@lcwmail.com\n>\nSent:\n\u00a0Thursday, February 20, 2025 9:56 AM\nTo:\n\u00a0Randi Mooney <\nrmooney@diligent.com\n>\nCc:\n\u00a0Brian Luong <\nbluong@diligent.com\n>; Don Reyes <\ndreyes@diligent.com\n>; Karen Lai <\nklai@diligent.com\n>; Kumud Mishra <\nkmishra@diligent.com\n>; Jorgelina Venturi <\nj.venturi@lcwmail.com\n>\nSubject:\n\u00a0RE: Diligent - WO_DELMONTE_COC_080624 - Del Monte CoC\n\u00a0\nEXTERNAL:\u00a0This email originated from outside of the organization.

This method involves the least amount of scope increase since we're at the translation phase. See below for what I did to the package to relay to them. Then can use the Menu to skip to the Certification slide to test both clickable decisions.\n\u00a0\n<image019.png>\n\u00a0\nOn the screen below, when the learner selects the No, the course will complete when the final slide loads. If the learner selects Yes, then the course will register as incomplete when reaching the final slide. \nIf this is not enough for them, please have Del Monte describe how they are going to mitigate this issue for themselves internally with the limitations of their LMS, and we can adjust the package accordingly. \nSince their LMS doesn't allow the reportage they want, they need to decide how they are going to reach out to people who appear incomplete if this isn't good enough. That may even need to include adding language to the course that would then need translation. Reconfiguration/Testing of the course for numerical scores to be sent to signal the selected response in question, would take 1hr per language to adjust totaling $1400 ($140*10lg) additional to the scope on my end. The adjustment I did here would only increase the scope between $140-$280 overall to apply the fix.\n<image020.png>\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\nPlease let us know your comments.\nThanks!\nCDS\n\u00a0\nCatalina De Sanctis\nTranslation Specialist\nLCW\n<image021.png>\n\u00a0\nWebsite\n\u00a0| \nTwitter\n\u00a0| \nFacebook\n\u00a0| \nLinkedIn\nView our upcoming events\n\u00a0| \nSign-up for our newsletter\n\u00a0\nFrom:\n\u00a0Randi Mooney <\nrmooney@diligent.com\n>\nSent:\n\u00a0Tuesday, February 11, 2025 2:31 PM\nTo:\n\u00a0Catalina De Sanctis <\nc.desanctis@lcwmail.com\n>\nCc:\n\u00a0Brian Luong <\nbluong@diligent.com\n>; Don Reyes <\ndreyes@diligent.com\n>; Karen Lai <\nklai@diligent.com\n>; Kumud Mishra <\nkmishra@diligent.com\n>\nSubject:\n\u00a0Re: Diligent - WO_DELMONTE_COC_080624 - Del Monte CoC\n\u00a0\nHi Catalina,\n\u00a0\nI wanted to follow up to see if Dustin's new test file for Del Monte is ready?

But in the meantime, sent over an invite for Friday.\n\u00a0\nHere is a summary of the situation:\nDel Monte noted earlier this week that the SCORM 2004 test file worked well in their LMS but followed up asking if we could send them their test report.\nWe informed them that without explicit access to their LMS and metadata, it would not be possible to generate a report on their behalf.\nThey replied that their LMS does not allow for any reports to be exported. \nThis is where the misunderstanding occurred.\nEarlier in the project, it was interpreted that they were not getting the desired information from SCORM 1.2 completion reports. That is why we decided to proceed with SCORM 2004 as it allows for customized reportage.\nWe have asked Del Monte to confirm with their LMS, Convercent, what type of reports or metadata can be generated or exported. \nAwaiting a response here.\nQuestions to discuss:\nIs there any way to run a report on behalf\u00a0of Del Monte?\nHave reporting capabilities been brought up in the prior year updates for Del Monte? \nIf so, what was the recommendation?\nThanks!\n_________________________\nDiligent\nRandi Mooney (Doran),\n\u00a0she/her\nAdvisory Specialist II, Advisory & Consulting Services\nrmooney@diligent.com\n\u00a0| \ndiligent.com\n\u00a0\nFrom:\n\u00a0Catalina De Sanctis <\nc.desanctis@lcwmail.com\n>\nSent:\n\u00a0Wednesday, January 29, 2025 7:23 PM\nTo:\n\u00a0Randi Mooney <\nrmooney@diligent.com\n>; Brian Luong <\nbluong@diligent.com\n>\nCc:\n\u00a0Don Reyes <\ndreyes@diligent.com\n>; Karen Lai <\nklai@diligent.com\n>; Kumud Mishra <\nkmishra@diligent.com\n>\nSubject:\n\u00a0RE: Diligent - WO_DELMONTE_COC_080624 - Del Monte CoC\n\u00a0\nHello Randi,\nIm sorry, tomorrow is complicated.

But as shown with our testing, the packages have worked and we'll need their LMS to send us the exact settings that will be needed to accompany Del Monte's method of how they plan to distinguish learners who said Yes or No on the questionnaire.\u00a0\n\u00a0\nPerhaps their system only shows a complete pass/fail scenario? We'd need guidance from their LMS on how scores are captured and if it can distinguish a 50% score that \"fails\" but still passes the course.\u00a0\n\u00a0\nPlease note our so long back and forth comes from their limiting system and as you can notice we are flexible and doing our best to help them get what they need.\nPlease let us know.\nWe are happy to help.\nBest,\nCDS\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\nCatalina De Sanctis\nTranslation Specialist\nLCW\n<image003.png>\n\u00a0\nWebsite\n\u00a0| \nTwitter\n\u00a0| \nFacebook\n\u00a0| \nLinkedIn\nView our upcoming events\n\u00a0| \nSign-up for our newsletter\n\u00a0\nFrom:\n\u00a0Randi Mooney <\nrmooney@diligent.com\n>\nSent:\n\u00a0Thursday, February 20, 2025 1:49 PM\nTo:\n\u00a0Catalina De Sanctis <\nc.desanctis@lcwmail.com\n>\nCc:\n\u00a0Brian Luong <\nbluong@diligent.com\n>; Don Reyes <\ndreyes@diligent.com\n>; Karen Lai <\nklai@diligent.com\n>; Kumud Mishra <\nkmishra@diligent.com\n>; Jorgelina Venturi <\nj.venturi@lcwmail.com\n>\nSubject:\n\u00a0Re: Diligent - WO_DELMONTE_COC_080624 - Del Monte CoC\n\u00a0\nHello,\n\u00a0\nDel Monte will be following up with their LMS on this matter. Also including another \ncomment \nDel Monte provided below:\n\u00a0\nI just sent the question to Convercent but in the screenshot shared, it showed a score of 100 for completion and a blank score for incompletion, so I don't think it is pass/fail score? The issue we have is that we can't distinguish all blank scores that are incomplete, and we don't know if in fact they completed the course. We could even be ok with a blank score if the participant was able to complete the course.\n\u00a0\nThanks,\n_________________________\nDiligent\nRandi Mooney,\n\u00a0she/her\nAdvisory Specialist II, Advisory & Consulting Services\nrmooney@diligent.com\n\u00a0| \ndiligent.com\n\u00a0\nUpcoming PTO: February 20th - February 25th\n\u00a0\nDisclaimer\nThe information contained in this communication from the sender is confidential.

We can adjust the\u00a0package to give them scores or try to adapt to their system of distinguishing learners with such limited LMS reporting features. But as shown with our testing, the packages have worked and we'll need their LMS to send us the exact settings that will be needed to accompany Del Monte's method of how they plan to distinguish learners who said Yes or No on the questionnaire.\u00a0\n\u00a0\nPerhaps their system only shows a complete pass/fail scenario? We'd need guidance from their LMS on how scores are captured and if it can distinguish a 50% score that \"fails\" but still passes the course.\u00a0\n\u00a0\nPlease note our so long back and forth comes from their limiting system and as you can notice we are flexible and doing our best to help them get what they need.\nPlease let us know.\nWe are happy to help.\nBest,\nCDS\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\nCatalina De Sanctis\nTranslation Specialist\nLCW\n<image003.png>\n\u00a0\nWebsite\n\u00a0| \nTwitter\n\u00a0| \nFacebook\n\u00a0| \nLinkedIn\nView our upcoming events\n\u00a0| \nSign-up for our newsletter\n\u00a0\nFrom:\n\u00a0Randi Mooney <\nrmooney@diligent.com\n>\nSent:\n\u00a0Thursday, February 20, 2025 1:49 PM\nTo:\n\u00a0Catalina De Sanctis <\nc.desanctis@lcwmail.com\n>\nCc:\n\u00a0Brian Luong <\nbluong@diligent.com\n>; Don Reyes <\ndreyes@diligent.com\n>; Karen Lai <\nklai@diligent.com\n>; Kumud Mishra <\nkmishra@diligent.com\n>; Jorgelina Venturi <\nj.venturi@lcwmail.com\n>\nSubject:\n\u00a0Re: Diligent - WO_DELMONTE_COC_080624 - Del Monte CoC\n\u00a0\nHello,\n\u00a0\nDel Monte will be following up with their LMS on this matter. Also including another \ncomment \nDel Monte provided below:\n\u00a0\nI just sent the question to Convercent but in the screenshot shared, it showed a score of 100 for completion and a blank score for incompletion, so I don't think it is pass/fail score? The issue we have is that we can't distinguish all blank scores that are incomplete, and we don't know if in fact they completed the course. We could even be ok with a blank score if the participant was able to complete the course.\n\u00a0\nThanks,\n_________________________\nDiligent\nRandi Mooney,\n\u00a0she/her\nAdvisory Specialist II, Advisory & Consulting Services\nrmooney@diligent.com\n\u00a0| \ndiligent.com\n\u00a0\nUpcoming PTO: February 20th - February 25th\n\u00a0\nDisclaimer\nThe information contained in this communication from the sender is confidential.

We can adjust the\u00a0package to give them scores or try to adapt to their system of distinguishing learners with such limited LMS reporting features. But as shown with our testing, the packages have worked and we'll need their LMS to send us the exact settings that will be needed to accompany Del Monte's method of how they plan to distinguish learners who said Yes or No on the questionnaire.\u00a0\n\u00a0\nPerhaps their system only shows a complete pass/fail scenario? We'd need guidance from their LMS on how scores are captured and if it can distinguish a 50% score that \"fails\" but still passes the course.\u00a0\n\u00a0\nPlease note our so long back and forth comes from their limiting system and as you can notice we are flexible and doing our best to help them get what they need.\nPlease let us know.\nWe are happy to help.\nBest,\nCDS\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\nCatalina De Sanctis\nTranslation Specialist\nLCW\n<image003.png>\n\u00a0\nWebsite\n\u00a0| \nTwitter\n\u00a0| \nFacebook\n\u00a0| \nLinkedIn\nView our upcoming events\n\u00a0| \nSign-up for our newsletter\n\u00a0\nFrom:\n\u00a0Randi Mooney <\nrmooney@diligent.com\n>\nSent:\n\u00a0Thursday, February 20, 2025 1:49 PM\nTo:\n\u00a0Catalina De Sanctis <\nc.desanctis@lcwmail.com\n>\nCc:\n\u00a0Brian Luong <\nbluong@diligent.com\n>; Don Reyes <\ndreyes@diligent.com\n>; Karen Lai <\nklai@diligent.com\n>; Kumud Mishra <\nkmishra@diligent.com\n>; Jorgelina Venturi <\nj.venturi@lcwmail.com\n>\nSubject:\n\u00a0Re: Diligent - WO_DELMONTE_COC_080624 - Del Monte CoC\n\u00a0\nHello,\n\u00a0\nDel Monte will be following up with their LMS on this matter.

What does the ETA look like for a testable ENG file with the numerical scores configured?\n\u00a0\nThanks!\n_________________________\nDiligent\nRandi Mooney,\n\u00a0she/her\nAdvisory Specialist II, Advisory & Consulting Services\nrmooney@diligent.com\n\u00a0| \ndiligent.com\n\u00a0\nUpcoming PTO: February 20th - February 25th\n\u00a0\nFrom:\n\u00a0Catalina De Sanctis <\nc.desanctis@lcwmail.com\n>\nSent:\n\u00a0Wednesday, February 12, 2025 2:14 PM\nTo:\n\u00a0Randi Mooney <\nrmooney@diligent.com\n>\nCc:\n\u00a0Brian Luong <\nbluong@diligent.com\n>; Don Reyes <\ndreyes@diligent.com\n>; Karen Lai <\nklai@diligent.com\n>; Kumud Mishra <\nkmishra@diligent.com\n>\nSubject:\n\u00a0RE: Diligent - WO_DELMONTE_COC_080624 - Del Monte CoC\n\u00a0\nEXTERNAL:\n\u00a0This email originated from outside of the organization.

This method involves the least amount of scope increase since we're at the translation phase. See below for what I did to the package to relay to them. Then can use the Menu to skip to the Certification slide to test both clickable decisions.\n\u00a0\n<image019.png>\n\u00a0\nOn the screen below, when the learner selects the No, the course will complete when the final slide loads. If the learner selects Yes, then the course will register as incomplete when reaching the final slide. \nIf this is not enough for them, please have Del Monte describe how they are going to mitigate this issue for themselves internally with the limitations of their LMS, and we can adjust the package accordingly. \nSince their LMS doesn't allow the reportage they want, they need to decide how they are going to reach out to people who appear incomplete if this isn't good enough. That may even need to include adding language to the course that would then need translation. Reconfiguration/Testing of the course for numerical scores to be sent to signal the selected response in question, would take 1hr per language to adjust totaling $1400 ($140*10lg) additional to the scope on my end. The adjustment I did here would only increase the scope between $140-$280 overall to apply the fix.\n<image020.png>\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\nPlease let us know your comments.\nThanks!\nCDS\n\u00a0\nCatalina De Sanctis\nTranslation Specialist\nLCW\n<image021.png>\n\u00a0\nWebsite\n\u00a0| \nTwitter\n\u00a0| \nFacebook\n\u00a0| \nLinkedIn\nView our upcoming events\n\u00a0| \nSign-up for our newsletter\n\u00a0\nFrom:\n\u00a0Randi Mooney <\nrmooney@diligent.com\n>\nSent:\n\u00a0Tuesday, February 11, 2025 2:31 PM\nTo:\n\u00a0Catalina De Sanctis <\nc.desanctis@lcwmail.com\n>\nCc:\n\u00a0Brian Luong <\nbluong@diligent.com\n>; Don Reyes <\ndreyes@diligent.com\n>; Karen Lai <\nklai@diligent.com\n>; Kumud Mishra <\nkmishra@diligent.com\n>\nSubject:\n\u00a0Re: Diligent - WO_DELMONTE_COC_080624 - Del Monte CoC\n\u00a0\nHi Catalina,\n\u00a0\nI wanted to follow up to see if Dustin's new test file for Del Monte is ready?

That is why we decided to proceed with SCORM 2004 as it allows for customized reportage.\nWe have asked Del Monte to confirm with their LMS, Convercent, what type of reports or metadata can be generated or exported. \nAwaiting a response here.\nQuestions to discuss:\nIs there any way to run a report on behalf\u00a0of Del Monte?\nHave reporting capabilities been brought up in the prior year updates for Del Monte? \nIf so, what was the recommendation?\nThanks!\n_________________________\nDiligent\nRandi Mooney (Doran),\n\u00a0she/her\nAdvisory Specialist II, Advisory & Consulting Services\nrmooney@diligent.com\n\u00a0| \ndiligent.com\n\u00a0\nFrom:\n\u00a0Catalina De Sanctis <\nc.desanctis@lcwmail.com\n>\nSent:\n\u00a0Wednesday, January 29, 2025 7:23 PM\nTo:\n\u00a0Randi Mooney <\nrmooney@diligent.com\n>; Brian Luong <\nbluong@diligent.com\n>\nCc:\n\u00a0Don Reyes <\ndreyes@diligent.com\n>; Karen Lai <\nklai@diligent.com\n>; Kumud Mishra <\nkmishra@diligent.com\n>\nSubject:\n\u00a0RE: Diligent - WO_DELMONTE_COC_080624 - Del Monte CoC\n\u00a0\nHello Randi,\nIm sorry, tomorrow is complicated.

We can adjust the\u00a0package to give them scores or try to adapt to their system of distinguishing learners with such limited LMS reporting features. But as shown with our testing, the packages have worked and we'll need their LMS to send us the exact settings that will be needed to accompany Del Monte's method of how they plan to distinguish learners who said Yes or No on the questionnaire.\u00a0\n\u00a0\nPerhaps their system only shows a complete pass/fail scenario? We'd need guidance from their LMS on how scores are captured and if it can distinguish a 50% score that \"fails\" but still passes the course.\u00a0\n\u00a0\nPlease note our so long back and forth comes from their limiting system and as you can notice we are flexible and doing our best to help them get what they need.\nPlease let us know.\nWe are happy to help.\nBest,\nCDS\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\nCatalina De Sanctis\nTranslation Specialist\nLCW\n<image003.png>\n\u00a0\nWebsite\n\u00a0| \nTwitter\n\u00a0| \nFacebook\n\u00a0| \nLinkedIn\nView our upcoming events\n\u00a0| \nSign-up for our newsletter\n\u00a0\nFrom:\n\u00a0Randi Mooney <\nrmooney@diligent.com\n>\nSent:\n\u00a0Thursday, February 20, 2025 1:49 PM\nTo:\n\u00a0Catalina De Sanctis <\nc.desanctis@lcwmail.com\n>\nCc:\n\u00a0Brian Luong <\nbluong@diligent.com\n>; Don Reyes <\ndreyes@diligent.com\n>; Karen Lai <\nklai@diligent.com\n>; Kumud Mishra <\nkmishra@diligent.com\n>; Jorgelina Venturi <\nj.venturi@lcwmail.com\n>\nSubject:\n\u00a0Re: Diligent - WO_DELMONTE_COC_080624 - Del Monte CoC\n\u00a0\nHello,\n\u00a0\nDel Monte will be following up with their LMS on this matter.

The issue we have is that we can't distinguish all blank scores that are incomplete, and we don't know if in fact they completed the course. We could even be ok with a blank score if the participant was able to complete the course.\n\u00a0\nThanks,\n_________________________\nDiligent\nRandi Mooney,\n\u00a0she/her\nAdvisory Specialist II, Advisory & Consulting Services\nrmooney@diligent.com\n\u00a0| \ndiligent.com\n\u00a0\nUpcoming PTO: February 20th - February 25th\n\u00a0\nDisclaimer\nThe information contained in this communication from the sender is confidential.

We can adjust the\u00a0package to give them scores or try to adapt to their system of distinguishing learners with such limited LMS reporting features. But as shown with our testing, the packages have worked and we'll need their LMS to send us the exact settings that will be needed to accompany Del Monte's method of how they plan to distinguish learners who said Yes or No on the questionnaire.\u00a0\n\u00a0\nPerhaps their system only shows a complete pass/fail scenario? We'd need guidance from their LMS on how scores are captured and if it can distinguish a 50% score that \"fails\" but still passes the course.\u00a0\n\u00a0\nPlease note our so long back and forth comes from their limiting system and as you can notice we are flexible and doing our best to help them get what they need.\nPlease let us know.\nWe are happy to help.\nBest,\nCDS\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\nCatalina De Sanctis\nTranslation Specialist\nLCW\n<image003.png>\n\u00a0\nWebsite\n\u00a0| \nTwitter\n\u00a0| \nFacebook\n\u00a0| \nLinkedIn\nView our upcoming events\n\u00a0| \nSign-up for our newsletter\n\u00a0\nFrom:\n\u00a0Randi Mooney <\nrmooney@diligent.com\n>\nSent:\n\u00a0Thursday, February 20, 2025 1:49 PM\nTo:\n\u00a0Catalina De Sanctis <\nc.desanctis@lcwmail.com\n>\nCc:\n\u00a0Brian Luong <\nbluong@diligent.com\n>; Don Reyes <\ndreyes@diligent.com\n>; Karen Lai <\nklai@diligent.com\n>; Kumud Mishra <\nkmishra@diligent.com\n>; Jorgelina Venturi <\nj.venturi@lcwmail.com\n>\nSubject:\n\u00a0Re: Diligent - WO_DELMONTE_COC_080624 - Del Monte CoC\n\u00a0\nHello,\n\u00a0\nDel Monte will be following up with their LMS on this matter.

This method involves the least amount of scope increase since we're at the translation phase. See below for what I did to the package to relay to them. Then can use the Menu to skip to the Certification slide to test both clickable decisions.\n\u00a0\n<image019.png>\n\u00a0\nOn the screen below, when the learner selects the No, the course will complete when the final slide loads. If the learner selects Yes, then the course will register as incomplete when reaching the final slide. \nIf this is not enough for them, please have Del Monte describe how they are going to mitigate this issue for themselves internally with the limitations of their LMS, and we can adjust the package accordingly. \nSince their LMS doesn't allow the reportage they want, they need to decide how they are going to reach out to people who appear incomplete if this isn't good enough. That may even need to include adding language to the course that would then need translation. Reconfiguration/Testing of the course for numerical scores to be sent to signal the selected response in question, would take 1hr per language to adjust totaling $1400 ($140*10lg) additional to the scope on my end. The adjustment I did here would only increase the scope between $140-$280 overall to apply the fix.\n<image020.png>\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\nPlease let us know your comments.\nThanks!\nCDS\n\u00a0\nCatalina De Sanctis\nTranslation Specialist\nLCW\n<image021.png>\n\u00a0\nWebsite\n\u00a0| \nTwitter\n\u00a0| \nFacebook\n\u00a0| \nLinkedIn\nView our upcoming events\n\u00a0| \nSign-up for our newsletter\n\u00a0\nFrom:\n\u00a0Randi Mooney <\nrmooney@diligent.com\n>\nSent:\n\u00a0Tuesday, February 11, 2025 2:31 PM\nTo:\n\u00a0Catalina De Sanctis <\nc.desanctis@lcwmail.com\n>\nCc:\n\u00a0Brian Luong <\nbluong@diligent.com\n>; Don Reyes <\ndreyes@diligent.com\n>; Karen Lai <\nklai@diligent.com\n>; Kumud Mishra <\nkmishra@diligent.com\n>\nSubject:\n\u00a0Re: Diligent - WO_DELMONTE_COC_080624 - Del Monte CoC\n\u00a0\nHi Catalina,\n\u00a0\nI wanted to follow up to see if Dustin's new test file for Del Monte is ready?

But in the meantime, sent over an invite for Friday.\n\u00a0\nHere is a summary of the situation:\nDel Monte noted earlier this week that the SCORM 2004 test file worked well in their LMS but followed up asking if we could send them their test report.\nWe informed them that without explicit access to their LMS and metadata, it would not be possible to generate a report on their behalf.\nThey replied that their LMS does not allow for any reports to be exported. This is where the misunderstanding occurred.\nEarlier in the project, it was interpreted that they were not getting the desired information from SCORM 1.2 completion reports. That is why we decided to proceed with SCORM 2004 as it allows for customized reportage.\nWe have asked Del Monte to confirm with their LMS, Convercent, what type of reports or metadata can be generated or exported. Awaiting a response here.\nQuestions to discuss:\nIs there any way to run a report on behalf\u00a0of Del Monte?\nHave reporting capabilities been brought up in the prior year updates for Del Monte? If so, what was the recommendation?\nThanks!\n_________________________\nDiligent\nRandi Mooney (Doran),\n\u00a0she/her\nAdvisory Specialist II, Advisory & Consulting Services\nrmooney@diligent.com\n\u00a0| \ndiligent.com\n\u00a0\nFrom:\n\u00a0Catalina De Sanctis <\nc.desanctis@lcwmail.com\n>\nSent:\n\u00a0Wednesday, January 29, 2025 7:23 PM\nTo:\n\u00a0Randi Mooney <\nrmooney@diligent.com\n>; Brian Luong <\nbluong@diligent.com\n>\nCc:\n\u00a0Don Reyes <\ndreyes@diligent.com\n>; Karen Lai <\nklai@diligent.com\n>; Kumud Mishra <\nkmishra@diligent.com\n>\nSubject:\n\u00a0RE: Diligent - WO_DELMONTE_COC_080624 - Del Monte CoC\n\u00a0\nHello Randi,\nIm sorry, tomorrow is complicated.

We can adjust the\u00a0package to give them scores or try to adapt to their system of distinguishing learners with such limited LMS reporting features. But as shown with our testing, the packages have worked and we'll need their LMS to send us the exact settings that will be needed to accompany Del Monte's method of how they plan to distinguish learners who said Yes or No on the questionnaire.\u00a0\n\u00a0\nPerhaps their system only shows a complete pass/fail scenario? We'd need guidance from their LMS on how scores are captured and if it can distinguish a 50% score that \"fails\" but still passes the course.\u00a0\n\u00a0\nPlease note our so long back and forth comes from their limiting system and as you can notice we are flexible and doing our best to help them get what they need.\nPlease let us know.\nWe are happy to help.\nBest,\nCDS\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\nCatalina De Sanctis\nTranslation Specialist\nLCW\n<image003.png>\n\u00a0\nWebsite\n\u00a0| \nTwitter\n\u00a0| \nFacebook\n\u00a0| \nLinkedIn\nView our upcoming events\n\u00a0| \nSign-up for our newsletter\n\u00a0\nFrom:\n\u00a0Randi Mooney <\nrmooney@diligent.com\n>\nSent:\n\u00a0Thursday, February 20, 2025 1:49 PM\nTo:\n\u00a0Catalina De Sanctis <\nc.desanctis@lcwmail.com\n>\nCc:\n\u00a0Brian Luong <\nbluong@diligent.com\n>; Don Reyes <\ndreyes@diligent.com\n>; Karen Lai <\nklai@diligent.com\n>; Kumud Mishra <\nkmishra@diligent.com\n>; Jorgelina Venturi <\nj.venturi@lcwmail.com\n>\nSubject:\n\u00a0Re: Diligent - WO_DELMONTE_COC_080624 - Del Monte CoC\n\u00a0\nHello,\n\u00a0\nDel Monte will be following up with their LMS on this matter.

The issue we have is that we can't distinguish all blank scores that are incomplete, and we don't know if in fact they completed the course.

This method involves the least amount of scope increase since we're at the translation phase. See below for what I did to the package to relay to them. Then can use the Menu to skip to the Certification slide to test both clickable decisions.\n\u00a0\n<image019.png>\n\u00a0\nOn the screen below, when the learner selects the No, the course will complete when the final slide loads. If the learner selects Yes, then the course will register as incomplete when reaching the final slide. \nIf this is not enough for them, please have Del Monte describe how they are going to mitigate this issue for themselves internally with the limitations of their LMS, and we can adjust the package accordingly. \nSince their LMS doesn't allow the reportage they want, they need to decide how they are going to reach out to people who appear incomplete if this isn't good enough. That may even need to include adding language to the course that would then need translation. Reconfiguration/Testing of the course for numerical scores to be sent to signal the selected response in question, would take 1hr per language to adjust totaling $1400 ($140*10lg) additional to the scope on my end. The adjustment I did here would only increase the scope between $140-$280 overall to apply the fix.\n<image020.png>\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\nPlease let us know your comments.\nThanks!\nCDS\n\u00a0\nCatalina De Sanctis\nTranslation Specialist\nLCW\n<image021.png>\n\u00a0\nWebsite\n\u00a0| \nTwitter\n\u00a0| \nFacebook\n\u00a0| \nLinkedIn\nView our upcoming events\n\u00a0| \nSign-up for our newsletter\n\u00a0\nFrom:\n\u00a0Randi Mooney <\nrmooney@diligent.com\n>\nSent:\n\u00a0Tuesday, February 11, 2025 2:31 PM\nTo:\n\u00a0Catalina De Sanctis <\nc.desanctis@lcwmail.com\n>\nCc:\n\u00a0Brian Luong <\nbluong@diligent.com\n>; Don Reyes <\ndreyes@diligent.com\n>; Karen Lai <\nklai@diligent.com\n>; Kumud Mishra <\nkmishra@diligent.com\n>\nSubject:\n\u00a0Re: Diligent - WO_DELMONTE_COC_080624 - Del Monte CoC\n\u00a0\nHi Catalina,\n\u00a0\nI wanted to follow up to see if Dustin's new test file for Del Monte is ready?

But in the meantime, sent over an invite for Friday.\n\u00a0\nHere is a summary of the situation:\nDel Monte noted earlier this week that the SCORM 2004 test file worked well in their LMS but followed up asking if we could send them their test report.\nWe informed them that without explicit access to their LMS and metadata, it would not be possible to generate a report on their behalf.\nThey replied that their LMS does not allow for any reports to be exported. This is where the misunderstanding occurred.\nEarlier in the project, it was interpreted that they were not getting the desired information from SCORM 1.2 completion reports. That is why we decided to proceed with SCORM 2004 as it allows for customized reportage.\nWe have asked Del Monte to confirm with their LMS, Convercent, what type of reports or metadata can be generated or exported. Awaiting a response here.\nQuestions to discuss:\nIs there any way to run a report on behalf\u00a0of Del Monte?\nHave reporting capabilities been brought up in the prior year updates for Del Monte? If so, what was the recommendation?\nThanks!\n_________________________\nDiligent\nRandi Mooney (Doran),\n\u00a0she/her\nAdvisory Specialist II, Advisory & Consulting Services\nrmooney@diligent.com\n\u00a0| \ndiligent.com\n\u00a0\nFrom:\n\u00a0Catalina De Sanctis <\nc.desanctis@lcwmail.com\n>\nSent:\n\u00a0Wednesday, January 29, 2025 7:23 PM\nTo:\n\u00a0Randi Mooney <\nrmooney@diligent.com\n>; Brian Luong <\nbluong@diligent.com\n>\nCc:\n\u00a0Don Reyes <\ndreyes@diligent.com\n>; Karen Lai <\nklai@diligent.com\n>; Kumud Mishra <\nkmishra@diligent.com\n>\nSubject:\n\u00a0RE: Diligent - WO_DELMONTE_COC_080624 - Del Monte CoC\n\u00a0\nHello Randi,\nIm sorry, tomorrow is complicated.

We can adjust the\u00a0package to give them scores or try to adapt to their system of distinguishing learners with such limited LMS reporting features. But as shown with our testing, the packages have worked and we'll need their LMS to send us the exact settings that will be needed to accompany Del Monte's method of how they plan to distinguish learners who said Yes or No on the questionnaire.\u00a0\n\u00a0\nPerhaps their system only shows a complete pass/fail scenario? We'd need guidance from their LMS on how scores are captured and if it can distinguish a 50% score that \"fails\" but still passes the course.\u00a0\n\u00a0\nPlease note our so long back and forth comes from their limiting system and as you can notice we are flexible and doing our best to help them get what they need.\nPlease let us know.\nWe are happy to help.\nBest,\nCDS\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\nCatalina De Sanctis\nTranslation Specialist\nLCW\n<image003.png>\n\u00a0\nWebsite\n\u00a0| \nTwitter\n\u00a0| \nFacebook\n\u00a0| \nLinkedIn\nView our upcoming events\n\u00a0| \nSign-up for our newsletter\n\u00a0\nFrom:\n\u00a0Randi Mooney <\nrmooney@diligent.com\n>\nSent:\n\u00a0Thursday, February 20, 2025 1:49 PM\nTo:\n\u00a0Catalina De Sanctis <\nc.desanctis@lcwmail.com\n>\nCc:\n\u00a0Brian Luong <\nbluong@diligent.com\n>; Don Reyes <\ndreyes@diligent.com\n>; Karen Lai <\nklai@diligent.com\n>; Kumud Mishra <\nkmishra@diligent.com\n>; Jorgelina Venturi <\nj.venturi@lcwmail.com\n>\nSubject:\n\u00a0Re: Diligent - WO_DELMONTE_COC_080624 - Del Monte CoC\n\u00a0\nHello,\n\u00a0\nDel Monte will be following up with their LMS on this matter.

This method involves the least amount of scope increase since we're at the translation phase. See below for what I did to the package to relay to them. Then can use the Menu to skip to the Certification slide to test both clickable decisions.\n\u00a0\n<image019.png>\n\u00a0\nOn the screen below, when the learner selects the No, the course will complete when the final slide loads. If the learner selects Yes, then the course will register as incomplete when reaching the final slide. \nIf this is not enough for them, please have Del Monte describe how they are going to mitigate this issue for themselves internally with the limitations of their LMS, and we can adjust the package accordingly. \nSince their LMS doesn't allow the reportage they want, they need to decide how they are going to reach out to people who appear incomplete if this isn't good enough. That may even need to include adding language to the course that would then need translation. Reconfiguration/Testing of the course for numerical scores to be sent to signal the selected response in question, would take 1hr per language to adjust totaling $1400 ($140*10lg) additional to the scope on my end. The adjustment I did here would only increase the scope between $140-$280 overall to apply the fix.\n<image020.png>\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\nPlease let us know your comments.\nThanks!\nCDS\n\u00a0\nCatalina De Sanctis\nTranslation Specialist\nLCW\n<image021.png>\n\u00a0\nWebsite\n\u00a0| \nTwitter\n\u00a0| \nFacebook\n\u00a0| \nLinkedIn\nView our upcoming events\n\u00a0| \nSign-up for our newsletter\n\u00a0\nFrom:\n\u00a0Randi Mooney <\nrmooney@diligent.com\n>\nSent:\n\u00a0Tuesday, February 11, 2025 2:31 PM\nTo:\n\u00a0Catalina De Sanctis <\nc.desanctis@lcwmail.com\n>\nCc:\n\u00a0Brian Luong <\nbluong@diligent.com\n>; Don Reyes <\ndreyes@diligent.com\n>; Karen Lai <\nklai@diligent.com\n>; Kumud Mishra <\nkmishra@diligent.com\n>\nSubject:\n\u00a0Re: Diligent - WO_DELMONTE_COC_080624 - Del Monte CoC\n\u00a0\nHi Catalina,\n\u00a0\nI wanted to follow up to see if Dustin's new test file for Del Monte is ready?

But in the meantime, sent over an invite for Friday.\n\u00a0\nHere is a summary of the situation:\nDel Monte noted earlier this week that the SCORM 2004 test file worked well in their LMS but followed up asking if we could send them their test report.\nWe informed them that without explicit access to their LMS and metadata, it would not be possible to generate a report on their behalf.\nThey replied that their LMS does not allow for any reports to be exported. This is where the misunderstanding occurred.\nEarlier in the project, it was interpreted that they were not getting the desired information from SCORM 1.2 completion reports. That is why we decided to proceed with SCORM 2004 as it allows for customized reportage.\nWe have asked Del Monte to confirm with their LMS, Convercent, what type of reports or metadata can be generated or exported. Awaiting a response here.\nQuestions to discuss:\nIs there any way to run a report on behalf\u00a0of Del Monte?\nHave reporting capabilities been brought up in the prior year updates for Del Monte? If so, what was the recommendation?\nThanks!\n_________________________\nDiligent\nRandi Mooney (Doran),\n\u00a0she/her\nAdvisory Specialist II, Advisory & Consulting Services\nrmooney@diligent.com\n\u00a0| \ndiligent.com\n\u00a0\nFrom:\n\u00a0Catalina De Sanctis <\nc.desanctis@lcwmail.com\n>\nSent:\n\u00a0Wednesday, January 29, 2025 7:23 PM\nTo:\n\u00a0Randi Mooney <\nrmooney@diligent.com\n>; Brian Luong <\nbluong@diligent.com\n>\nCc:\n\u00a0Don Reyes <\ndreyes@diligent.com\n>; Karen Lai <\nklai@diligent.com\n>; Kumud Mishra <\nkmishra@diligent.com\n>\nSubject:\n\u00a0RE: Diligent - WO_DELMONTE_COC_080624 - Del Monte CoC\n\u00a0\nHello Randi,\nIm sorry, tomorrow is complicated.

We can adjust the\u00a0package to give them scores or try to adapt to their system of distinguishing learners with such limited LMS reporting features. But as shown with our testing, the packages have worked and we'll need their LMS to send us the exact settings that will be needed to accompany Del Monte's method of how they plan to distinguish learners who said Yes or No on the questionnaire.\u00a0\n\u00a0\nPerhaps their system only shows a complete pass/fail scenario? We'd need guidance from their LMS on how scores are captured and if it can distinguish a 50% score that \"fails\" but still passes the course.\u00a0\n\u00a0\nPlease note our so long back and forth comes from their limiting system and as you can notice we are flexible and doing our best to help them get what they need.\nPlease let us know.\nWe are happy to help.\nBest,\nCDS\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\nCatalina De Sanctis\nTranslation Specialist\nLCW\n<image003.png>\n\u00a0\nWebsite\n\u00a0| \nTwitter\n\u00a0| \nFacebook\n\u00a0| \nLinkedIn\nView our upcoming events\n\u00a0| \nSign-up for our newsletter\n\u00a0\nFrom:\n\u00a0Randi Mooney <\nrmooney@diligent.com\n>\nSent:\n\u00a0Thursday, February 20, 2025 1:49 PM\nTo:\n\u00a0Catalina De Sanctis <\nc.desanctis@lcwmail.com\n>\nCc:\n\u00a0Brian Luong <\nbluong@diligent.com\n>; Don Reyes <\ndreyes@diligent.com\n>; Karen Lai <\nklai@diligent.com\n>; Kumud Mishra <\nkmishra@diligent.com\n>; Jorgelina Venturi <\nj.venturi@lcwmail.com\n>\nSubject:\n\u00a0Re: Diligent - WO_DELMONTE_COC_080624 - Del Monte CoC\n\u00a0\nHello,\n\u00a0\nDel Monte will be following up with their LMS on this matter.

The issue we have is that we can't distinguish all blank scores that are incomplete, and we don't know if in fact they completed the course. We could even be ok with a blank score if the participant was able to complete the course.\n\u00a0\nThanks,\n_________________________\nDiligent\nRandi Mooney,\n\u00a0she/her\nAdvisory Specialist II, Advisory & Consulting Services\nrmooney@diligent.com\n\u00a0| \ndiligent.com\n\u00a0\nUpcoming PTO: February 20th - February 25th\n\u00a0\nDisclaimer\nThe information contained in this communication from the sender is confidential.

We can adjust the\u00a0package to give them scores or try to adapt to their system of distinguishing learners with such limited LMS reporting features. But as shown with our testing, the packages have worked and we'll need their LMS to send us the exact settings that will be needed to accompany Del Monte's method of how they plan to distinguish learners who said Yes or No on the questionnaire.\u00a0\n\u00a0\nPerhaps their system only shows a complete pass/fail scenario? We'd need guidance from their LMS on how scores are captured and if it can distinguish a 50% score that \"fails\" but still passes the course.\u00a0\n\u00a0\nPlease note our so long back and forth comes from their limiting system and as you can notice we are flexible and doing our best to help them get what they need.\nPlease let us know.\nWe are happy to help.\nBest,\nCDS\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\nCatalina De Sanctis\nTranslation Specialist\nLCW\n<image003.png>\n\u00a0\nWebsite\n\u00a0| \nTwitter\n\u00a0| \nFacebook\n\u00a0| \nLinkedIn\nView our upcoming events\n\u00a0| \nSign-up for our newsletter\n\u00a0\nFrom:\n\u00a0Randi Mooney <\nrmooney@diligent.com\n>\nSent:\n\u00a0Thursday, February 20, 2025 1:49 PM\nTo:\n\u00a0Catalina De Sanctis <\nc.desanctis@lcwmail.com\n>\nCc:\n\u00a0Brian Luong <\nbluong@diligent.com\n>; Don Reyes <\ndreyes@diligent.com\n>; Karen Lai <\nklai@diligent.com\n>; Kumud Mishra <\nkmishra@diligent.com\n>; Jorgelina Venturi <\nj.venturi@lcwmail.com\n>\nSubject:\n\u00a0Re: Diligent - WO_DELMONTE_COC_080624 - Del Monte CoC\n\u00a0\nHello,\n\u00a0\nDel Monte will be following up with their LMS on this matter. Also including another \ncomment \nDel Monte provided below:\n\u00a0\nI just sent the question to Convercent but in the screenshot shared, it showed a score of 100 for completion and a blank score for incompletion, so I don't think it is pass/fail score? The issue we have is that we can't distinguish all blank scores that are incomplete, and we don't know if in fact they completed the course. We could even be ok with a blank score if the participant was able to complete the course.\n\u00a0\nThanks,\n_________________________\nDiligent\nRandi Mooney,\n\u00a0she/her\nAdvisory Specialist II, Advisory & Consulting Services\nrmooney@diligent.com\n\u00a0| \ndiligent.com\n\u00a0\nUpcoming PTO: February 20th - February 25th\n\u00a0\nDisclaimer\nThe information contained in this communication from the sender is confidential.

We can adjust the\u00a0package to give them scores or try to adapt to their system of distinguishing learners with such limited LMS reporting features. But as shown with our testing, the packages have worked and we'll need their LMS to send us the exact settings that will be needed to accompany Del Monte's method of how they plan to distinguish learners who said Yes or No on the questionnaire.\u00a0\n\u00a0\nPerhaps their system only shows a complete pass/fail scenario? We'd need guidance from their LMS on how scores are captured and if it can distinguish a 50% score that \"fails\" but still passes the course.\u00a0\n\u00a0\nPlease note our so long back and forth comes from their limiting system and as you can notice we are flexible and doing our best to help them get what they need.\nPlease let us know.\nWe are happy to help.\nBest,\nCDS\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\nCatalina De Sanctis\nTranslation Specialist\nLCW\n<image003.png>\n\u00a0\nWebsite\n\u00a0| \nTwitter\n\u00a0| \nFacebook\n\u00a0| \nLinkedIn\nView our upcoming events\n\u00a0| \nSign-up for our newsletter\n\u00a0\nFrom:\n\u00a0Randi Mooney <\nrmooney@diligent.com\n>\nSent:\n\u00a0Thursday, February 20, 2025 1:49 PM\nTo:\n\u00a0Catalina De Sanctis <\nc.desanctis@lcwmail.com\n>\nCc:\n\u00a0Brian Luong <\nbluong@diligent.com\n>; Don Reyes <\ndreyes@diligent.com\n>; Karen Lai <\nklai@diligent.com\n>; Kumud Mishra <\nkmishra@diligent.com\n>; Jorgelina Venturi <\nj.venturi@lcwmail.com\n>\nSubject:\n\u00a0Re: Diligent - WO_DELMONTE_COC_080624 - Del Monte CoC\n\u00a0\nHello,\n\u00a0\nDel Monte will be following up with their LMS on this matter. Also including another \ncomment \nDel Monte provided below:\n\u00a0\nI just sent the question to Convercent but in the screenshot shared, it showed a score of 100 for completion and a blank score for incompletion, so I don't think it is pass/fail score? The issue we have is that we can't distinguish all blank scores that are incomplete, and we don't know if in fact they completed the course. We could even be ok with a blank score if the participant was able to complete the course.\n\u00a0\nThanks,\n_________________________\nDiligent\nRandi Mooney,\n\u00a0she/her\nAdvisory Specialist II, Advisory & Consulting Services\nrmooney@diligent.com\n\u00a0| \ndiligent.com\n\u00a0\nUpcoming PTO: February 20th - February 25th",

We can adjust the\u00a0package to give them scores or try to adapt to their system of distinguishing learners with such limited LMS reporting features. But as shown with our testing, the packages have worked and we'll need their LMS to send us the exact settings that will be needed to accompany Del Monte's method of how they plan to distinguish learners who said Yes or No on the questionnaire.\u00a0\n\u00a0\nPerhaps their system only shows a complete pass/fail scenario? We'd need guidance from their LMS on how scores are captured and if it can distinguish a 50% score that \"fails\" but still passes the course.\u00a0\n\u00a0\nPlease note our so long back and forth comes from their limiting system and as you can notice we are flexible and doing our best to help them get what they need.\nPlease let us know.\nWe are happy to help.\nBest,\nCDS\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\nCatalina De Sanctis\nTranslation Specialist\nLCW\n<image003.png>\n\u00a0\nWebsite\n\u00a0| \nTwitter\n\u00a0| \nFacebook\n\u00a0| \nLinkedIn\nView our upcoming events\n\u00a0| \nSign-up for our newsletter\n\u00a0\nFrom:\n\u00a0Randi Mooney <\nrmooney@diligent.com\n>\nSent:\n\u00a0Thursday, February 20, 2025 1:49 PM\nTo:\n\u00a0Catalina De Sanctis <\nc.desanctis@lcwmail.com\n>\nCc:\n\u00a0Brian Luong <\nbluong@diligent.com\n>; Don Reyes <\ndreyes@diligent.com\n>; Karen Lai <\nklai@diligent.com\n>; Kumud Mishra <\nkmishra@diligent.com\n>; Jorgelina Venturi <\nj.venturi@lcwmail.com\n>\nSubject:\n\u00a0Re: Diligent - WO_DELMONTE_COC_080624 - Del Monte CoC\n\u00a0\nHello,\n\u00a0\nDel Monte will be following up with their LMS on this matter. Also including another \ncomment \nDel Monte provided below:\n\u00a0\nI just sent the question to Convercent but in the screenshot shared, it showed a score of 100 for completion and a blank score for incompletion, so I don't think it is pass/fail score? The issue we have is that we can't distinguish all blank scores that are incomplete, and we don't know if in fact they completed the course. We could even be ok with a blank score if the participant was able to complete the course.\n\u00a0\nThanks,\n_________________________\nDiligent\nRandi Mooney,\n\u00a0she/her\nAdvisory Specialist II, Advisory & Consulting Services\nrmooney@diligent.com\n\u00a0| \ndiligent.com\n\u00a0\nUpcoming PTO: February 20th - February 25th",

We can adjust the\u00a0package to give them scores or try to adapt to their system of distinguishing learners with such limited LMS reporting features. But as shown with our testing, the packages have worked and we'll need their LMS to send us the exact settings that will be needed to accompany Del Monte's method of how they plan to distinguish learners who said Yes or No on the questionnaire.\u00a0\n\u00a0\nPerhaps their system only shows a complete pass/fail scenario? We'd need guidance from their LMS on how scores are captured and if it can distinguish a 50% score that \"fails\" but still passes the course.\u00a0\n\u00a0\nPlease note our so long back and forth comes from their limiting system and as you can notice we are flexible and doing our best to help them get what they need.\nPlease let us know.\nWe are happy to help.\nBest,\nCDS\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\nCatalina De Sanctis\nTranslation Specialist\nLCW\n<image003.png>\n\u00a0\nWebsite\n\u00a0| \nTwitter\n\u00a0| \nFacebook\n\u00a0| \nLinkedIn\nView our upcoming events\n\u00a0| \nSign-up for our newsletter\n\u00a0\nFrom:\n\u00a0Randi Mooney <\nrmooney@diligent.com\n>\nSent:\n\u00a0Thursday, February 20, 2025 1:49 PM\nTo:\n\u00a0Catalina De Sanctis <\nc.desanctis@lcwmail.com\n>\nCc:\n\u00a0Brian Luong <\nbluong@diligent.com\n>; Don Reyes <\ndreyes@diligent.com\n>; Karen Lai <\nklai@diligent.com\n>; Kumud Mishra <\nkmishra@diligent.com\n>; Jorgelina Venturi <\nj.venturi@lcwmail.com\n>\nSubject:\n\u00a0Re: Diligent - WO_DELMONTE_COC_080624 - Del Monte CoC\n\u00a0\nHello,\n\u00a0\nDel Monte will be following up with their LMS on this matter. Also including another \ncomment \nDel Monte provided below:\n\u00a0\nI just sent the question to Convercent but in the screenshot shared, it showed a score of 100 for completion and a blank score for incompletion, so I don't think it is pass/fail score? The issue we have is that we can't distinguish all blank scores that are incomplete, and we don't know if in fact they completed the course. We could even be ok with a blank score if the participant was able to complete the course.\n\u00a0\nThanks,\n_________________________\nDiligent\nRandi Mooney,\n\u00a0she/her\nAdvisory Specialist II, Advisory & Consulting Services\nrmooney@diligent.com\n\u00a0| \ndiligent.com\n\u00a0\nUpcoming PTO: February 20th - February 25th",

We can adjust the\u00a0package to give them scores or try to adapt to their system of distinguishing learners with such limited LMS reporting features. But as shown with our testing, the packages have worked and we'll need their LMS to send us the exact settings that will be needed to accompany Del Monte's method of how they plan to distinguish learners who said Yes or No on the questionnaire.\u00a0\n\u00a0\nPerhaps their system only shows a complete pass/fail scenario? We'd need guidance from their LMS on how scores are captured and if it can distinguish a 50% score that \"fails\" but still passes the course.\u00a0\n\u00a0\nPlease note our so long back and forth comes from their limiting system and as you can notice we are flexible and doing our best to help them get what they need.\nPlease let us know.\nWe are happy to help.\nBest,\nCDS\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\nCatalina De Sanctis\nTranslation Specialist\nLCW\n<image003.png>\n\u00a0\nWebsite\n\u00a0| \nTwitter\n\u00a0| \nFacebook\n\u00a0| \nLinkedIn\nView our upcoming events\n\u00a0| \nSign-up for our newsletter\n\u00a0\nFrom:\n\u00a0Randi Mooney <\nrmooney@diligent.com\n>\nSent:\n\u00a0Thursday, February 20, 2025 1:49 PM\nTo:\n\u00a0Catalina De Sanctis <\nc.desanctis@lcwmail.com\n>\nCc:\n\u00a0Brian Luong <\nbluong@diligent.com\n>; Don Reyes <\ndreyes@diligent.com\n>; Karen Lai <\nklai@diligent.com\n>; Kumud Mishra <\nkmishra@diligent.com\n>; Jorgelina Venturi <\nj.venturi@lcwmail.com\n>\nSubject:\n\u00a0Re: Diligent - WO_DELMONTE_COC_080624 - Del Monte CoC\n\u00a0\nHello,\n\u00a0\nDel Monte will be following up with their LMS on this matter.

This method involves the least amount of scope increase since we're at the translation phase. See below for what I did to the package to relay to them. Then can use the Menu to skip to the Certification slide to test both clickable decisions.\n\u00a0\n<image019.png>\n\u00a0\nOn the screen below, when the learner selects the No, the course will complete when the final slide loads. If the learner selects Yes, then the course will register as incomplete when reaching the final slide. \nIf this is not enough for them, please have Del Monte describe how they are going to mitigate this issue for themselves internally with the limitations of their LMS, and we can adjust the package accordingly. \nSince their LMS doesn't allow the reportage they want, they need to decide how they are going to reach out to people who appear incomplete if this isn't good enough. That may even need to include adding language to the course that would then need translation. Reconfiguration/Testing of the course for numerical scores to be sent to signal the selected response in question, would take 1hr per language to adjust totaling $1400 ($140*10lg) additional to the scope on my end. The adjustment I did here would only increase the scope between $140-$280 overall to apply the fix.\n<image020.png>\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\nPlease let us know your comments.\nThanks!\nCDS\n\u00a0\nCatalina De Sanctis\nTranslation Specialist\nLCW\n<image021.png>\n\u00a0\nWebsite\n\u00a0| \nTwitter\n\u00a0| \nFacebook\n\u00a0| \nLinkedIn\nView our upcoming events\n\u00a0| \nSign-up for our newsletter\n\u00a0\nFrom:\n\u00a0Randi Mooney <\nrmooney@diligent.com\n>\nSent:\n\u00a0Tuesday, February 11, 2025 2:31 PM\nTo:\n\u00a0Catalina De Sanctis <\nc.desanctis@lcwmail.com\n>\nCc:\n\u00a0Brian Luong <\nbluong@diligent.com\n>; Don Reyes <\ndreyes@diligent.com\n>; Karen Lai <\nklai@diligent.com\n>; Kumud Mishra <\nkmishra@diligent.com\n>\nSubject:\n\u00a0Re: Diligent - WO_DELMONTE_COC_080624 - Del Monte CoC\n\u00a0\nHi Catalina,\n\u00a0\nI wanted to follow up to see if Dustin's new test file for Del Monte is ready?

But in the meantime, sent over an invite for Friday.\n\u00a0\nHere is a summary of the situation:\nDel Monte noted earlier this week that the SCORM 2004 test file worked well in their LMS but followed up asking if we could send them their test report.\nWe informed them that without explicit access to their LMS and metadata, it would not be possible to generate a report on their behalf.\nThey replied that their LMS does not allow for any reports to be exported. This is where the misunderstanding occurred.\nEarlier in the project, it was interpreted that they were not getting the desired information from SCORM 1.2 completion reports. That is why we decided to proceed with SCORM 2004 as it allows for customized reportage.\nWe have asked Del Monte to confirm with their LMS, Convercent, what type of reports or metadata can be generated or exported. Awaiting a response here.\nQuestions to discuss:\nIs there any way to run a report on behalf\u00a0of Del Monte?\nHave reporting capabilities been brought up in the prior year updates for Del Monte? If so, what was the recommendation?\nThanks!\n_________________________\nDiligent\nRandi Mooney (Doran),\n\u00a0she/her\nAdvisory Specialist II, Advisory & Consulting Services\nrmooney@diligent.com\n\u00a0| \ndiligent.com\n\u00a0\nFrom:\n\u00a0Catalina De Sanctis <\nc.desanctis@lcwmail.com\n>\nSent:\n\u00a0Wednesday, January 29, 2025 7:23 PM\nTo:\n\u00a0Randi Mooney <\nrmooney@diligent.com\n>; Brian Luong <\nbluong@diligent.com\n>\nCc:\n\u00a0Don Reyes <\ndreyes@diligent.com\n>; Karen Lai <\nklai@diligent.com\n>; Kumud Mishra <\nkmishra@diligent.com\n>\nSubject:\n\u00a0RE: Diligent - WO_DELMONTE_COC_080624 - Del Monte CoC\n\u00a0\nHello Randi,\nIm sorry, tomorrow is complicated.

We can adjust the\u00a0package to give them scores or try to adapt to their system of distinguishing learners with such limited LMS reporting features. But as shown with our testing, the packages have worked and we'll need their LMS to send us the exact settings that will be needed to accompany Del Monte's method of how they plan to distinguish learners who said Yes or No on the questionnaire.\u00a0\n\u00a0\nPerhaps their system only shows a complete pass/fail scenario? We'd need guidance from their LMS on how scores are captured and if it can distinguish a 50% score that \"fails\" but still passes the course.\u00a0\n\u00a0\nPlease note our so long back and forth comes from their limiting system and as you can notice we are flexible and doing our best to help them get what they need.\nPlease let us know.\nWe are happy to help.\nBest,\nCDS\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\nCatalina De Sanctis\nTranslation Specialist\nLCW\n<image003.png>\n\u00a0\nWebsite\n\u00a0| \nTwitter\n\u00a0| \nFacebook\n\u00a0| \nLinkedIn\nView our upcoming events\n\u00a0| \nSign-up for our newsletter\n\u00a0\nFrom:\n\u00a0Randi Mooney <\nrmooney@diligent.com\n>\nSent:\n\u00a0Thursday, February 20, 2025 1:49 PM\nTo:\n\u00a0Catalina De Sanctis <\nc.desanctis@lcwmail.com\n>\nCc:\n\u00a0Brian Luong <\nbluong@diligent.com\n>; Don Reyes <\ndreyes@diligent.com\n>; Karen Lai <\nklai@diligent.com\n>; Kumud Mishra <\nkmishra@diligent.com\n>; Jorgelina Venturi <\nj.venturi@lcwmail.com\n>\nSubject:\n\u00a0Re: Diligent - WO_DELMONTE_COC_080624 - Del Monte CoC\n\u00a0\nHello,\n\u00a0\nDel Monte will be following up with their LMS on this matter.

This method involves the least amount of scope increase since we're at the translation phase. See below for what I did to the package to relay to them. Then can use the Menu to skip to the Certification slide to test both clickable decisions.\n\u00a0\n<image019.png>\n\u00a0\nOn the screen below, when the learner selects the No, the course will complete when the final slide loads. If the learner selects Yes, then the course will register as incomplete when reaching the final slide. \nIf this is not enough for them, please have Del Monte describe how they are going to mitigate this issue for themselves internally with the limitations of their LMS, and we can adjust the package accordingly. \nSince their LMS doesn't allow the reportage they want, they need to decide how they are going to reach out to people who appear incomplete if this isn't good enough. That may even need to include adding language to the course that would then need translation. Reconfiguration/Testing of the course for numerical scores to be sent to signal the selected response in question, would take 1hr per language to adjust totaling $1400 ($140*10lg) additional to the scope on my end. The adjustment I did here would only increase the scope between $140-$280 overall to apply the fix.\n<image020.png>\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\nPlease let us know your comments.\nThanks!\nCDS\n\u00a0\nCatalina De Sanctis\nTranslation Specialist\nLCW\n<image021.png>\n\u00a0\nWebsite\n\u00a0| \nTwitter\n\u00a0| \nFacebook\n\u00a0| \nLinkedIn\nView our upcoming events\n\u00a0| \nSign-up for our newsletter\n\u00a0\nFrom:\n\u00a0Randi Mooney <\nrmooney@diligent.com\n>\nSent:\n\u00a0Tuesday, February 11, 2025 2:31 PM\nTo:\n\u00a0Catalina De Sanctis <\nc.desanctis@lcwmail.com\n>\nCc:\n\u00a0Brian Luong <\nbluong@diligent.com\n>; Don Reyes <\ndreyes@diligent.com\n>; Karen Lai <\nklai@diligent.com\n>; Kumud Mishra <\nkmishra@diligent.com\n>\nSubject:\n\u00a0Re: Diligent - WO_DELMONTE_COC_080624 - Del Monte CoC\n\u00a0\nHi Catalina,\n\u00a0\nI wanted to follow up to see if Dustin's new test file for Del Monte is ready?

But in the meantime, sent over an invite for Friday.\n\u00a0\nHere is a summary of the situation:\nDel Monte noted earlier this week that the SCORM 2004 test file worked well in their LMS but followed up asking if we could send them their test report.\nWe informed them that without explicit access to their LMS and metadata, it would not be possible to generate a report on their behalf.\nThey replied that their LMS does not allow for any reports to be exported. This is where the misunderstanding occurred.\nEarlier in the project, it was interpreted that they were not getting the desired information from SCORM 1.2 completion reports. That is why we decided to proceed with SCORM 2004 as it allows for customized reportage.\nWe have asked Del Monte to confirm with their LMS, Convercent, what type of reports or metadata can be generated or exported. Awaiting a response here.\nQuestions to discuss:\nIs there any way to run a report on behalf\u00a0of Del Monte?\nHave reporting capabilities been brought up in the prior year updates for Del Monte? If so, what was the recommendation?\nThanks!\n_________________________\nDiligent\nRandi Mooney (Doran),\n\u00a0she/her\nAdvisory Specialist II, Advisory & Consulting Services\nrmooney@diligent.com\n\u00a0| \ndiligent.com\n\u00a0\nFrom:\n\u00a0Catalina De Sanctis <\nc.desanctis@lcwmail.com\n>\nSent:\n\u00a0Wednesday, January 29, 2025 7:23 PM\nTo:\n\u00a0Randi Mooney <\nrmooney@diligent.com\n>; Brian Luong <\nbluong@diligent.com\n>\nCc:\n\u00a0Don Reyes <\ndreyes@diligent.com\n>; Karen Lai <\nklai@diligent.com\n>; Kumud Mishra <\nkmishra@diligent.com\n>\nSubject:\n\u00a0RE: Diligent - WO_DELMONTE_COC_080624 - Del Monte CoC\n\u00a0\nHello Randi,\nIm sorry, tomorrow is complicated.

We can adjust the\u00a0package to give them scores or try to adapt to their system of distinguishing learners with such limited LMS reporting features. But as shown with our testing, the packages have worked and we'll need their LMS to send us the exact settings that will be needed to accompany Del Monte's method of how they plan to distinguish learners who said Yes or No on the questionnaire.\u00a0\n\u00a0\nPerhaps their system only shows a complete pass/fail scenario? We'd need guidance from their LMS on how scores are captured and if it can distinguish a 50% score that \"fails\" but still passes the course.\u00a0\n\u00a0\nPlease note our so long back and forth comes from their limiting system and as you can notice we are flexible and doing our best to help them get what they need.\nPlease let us know.\nWe are happy to help.\nBest,\nCDS\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\nCatalina De Sanctis\nTranslation Specialist\nLCW\n<image003.png>\n\u00a0\nWebsite\n\u00a0| \nTwitter\n\u00a0| \nFacebook\n\u00a0| \nLinkedIn\nView our upcoming events\n\u00a0| \nSign-up for our newsletter\n\u00a0\nFrom:\n\u00a0Randi Mooney <\nrmooney@diligent.com\n>\nSent:\n\u00a0Thursday, February 20, 2025 1:49 PM\nTo:\n\u00a0Catalina De Sanctis <\nc.desanctis@lcwmail.com\n>\nCc:\n\u00a0Brian Luong <\nbluong@diligent.com\n>; Don Reyes <\ndreyes@diligent.com\n>; Karen Lai <\nklai@diligent.com\n>; Kumud Mishra <\nkmishra@diligent.com\n>; Jorgelina Venturi <\nj.venturi@lcwmail.com\n>\nSubject:\n\u00a0Re: Diligent - WO_DELMONTE_COC_080624 - Del Monte CoC\n\u00a0\nHello,\n\u00a0\nDel Monte will be following up with their LMS on this matter.

The issue we have is that we can't distinguish all blank scores that are incomplete, and we don't know if in fact they completed the course. We could even be ok with a blank score if the participant was able to complete the course.\n\u00a0\nThanks,\n_________________________\nDiligent\nRandi Mooney,\n\u00a0she/her\nAdvisory Specialist II, Advisory & Consulting Services\nrmooney@diligent.com\n\u00a0| \ndiligent.com\n\u00a0\nUpcoming PTO: February 20th - February 25th\nDisclaimer\nThe information contained in this communication from the sender is confidential.

We can adjust the\u00a0package to give them scores or try to adapt to their system of distinguishing learners with such limited LMS reporting features. But as shown with our testing, the packages have worked and we'll need their LMS to send us the exact settings that will be needed to accompany Del Monte's method of how they plan to distinguish learners who said Yes or No on the questionnaire.\u00a0\n\u00a0\nPerhaps their system only shows a complete pass/fail scenario? We'd need guidance from their LMS on how scores are captured and if it can distinguish a 50% score that \"fails\" but still passes the course.\u00a0\n\u00a0\nPlease note our so long back and forth comes from their limiting system and as you can notice we are flexible and doing our best to help them get what they need.\nPlease let us know.\nWe are happy to help.\nBest,\nCDS\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\nCatalina De Sanctis\nTranslation Specialist\nLCW\n<image003.png>\n\u00a0\nWebsite\n\u00a0| \nTwitter\n\u00a0| \nFacebook\n\u00a0| \nLinkedIn\nView our upcoming events\n\u00a0| \nSign-up for our newsletter\n\u00a0\nFrom:\n\u00a0Randi Mooney <\nrmooney@diligent.com\n>\nSent:\n\u00a0Thursday, February 20, 2025 1:49 PM\nTo:\n\u00a0Catalina De Sanctis <\nc.desanctis@lcwmail.com\n>\nCc:\n\u00a0Brian Luong <\nbluong@diligent.com\n>; Don Reyes <\ndreyes@diligent.com\n>; Karen Lai <\nklai@diligent.com\n>; Kumud Mishra <\nkmishra@diligent.com\n>; Jorgelina Venturi <\nj.venturi@lcwmail.com\n>\nSubject:\n\u00a0Re: Diligent - WO_DELMONTE_COC_080624 - Del Monte CoC\n\u00a0\nHello,\n\u00a0\nDel Monte will be following up with their LMS on this matter.

The issue we have is that we can't distinguish all blank scores that are incomplete, and we don't know if in fact they completed the course.

This method involves the least amount of scope increase since we're at the translation phase. See below for what I did to the package to relay to them. Then can use the Menu to skip to the Certification slide to test both clickable decisions.\n\u00a0\n<image019.png>\n\u00a0\nOn the screen below, when the learner selects the No, the course will complete when the final slide loads. If the learner selects Yes, then the course will register as incomplete when reaching the final slide. \nIf this is not enough for them, please have Del Monte describe how they are going to mitigate this issue for themselves internally with the limitations of their LMS, and we can adjust the package accordingly. \nSince their LMS doesn't allow the reportage they want, they need to decide how they are going to reach out to people who appear incomplete if this isn't good enough. That may even need to include adding language to the course that would then need translation. Reconfiguration/Testing of the course for numerical scores to be sent to signal the selected response in question, would take 1hr per language to adjust totaling $1400 ($140*10lg) additional to the scope on my end. The adjustment I did here would only increase the scope between $140-$280 overall to apply the fix.\n<image020.png>\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\nPlease let us know your comments.\nThanks!\nCDS\n\u00a0\nCatalina De Sanctis\nTranslation Specialist\nLCW\n<image021.png>\n\u00a0\nWebsite\n\u00a0| \nTwitter\n\u00a0| \nFacebook\n\u00a0| \nLinkedIn\nView our upcoming events\n\u00a0| \nSign-up for our newsletter\n\u00a0\nFrom:\n\u00a0Randi Mooney <\nrmooney@diligent.com\n>\nSent:\n\u00a0Tuesday, February 11, 2025 2:31 PM\nTo:\n\u00a0Catalina De Sanctis <\nc.desanctis@lcwmail.com\n>\nCc:\n\u00a0Brian Luong <\nbluong@diligent.com\n>; Don Reyes <\ndreyes@diligent.com\n>; Karen Lai <\nklai@diligent.com\n>; Kumud Mishra <\nkmishra@diligent.com\n>\nSubject:\n\u00a0Re: Diligent - WO_DELMONTE_COC_080624 - Del Monte CoC\n\u00a0\nHi Catalina,\n\u00a0\nI wanted to follow up to see if Dustin's new test file for Del Monte is ready?

But in the meantime, sent over an invite for Friday.\n\u00a0\nHere is a summary of the situation:\nDel Monte noted earlier this week that the SCORM 2004 test file worked well in their LMS but followed up asking if we could send them their test report.\nWe informed them that without explicit access to their LMS and metadata, it would not be possible to generate a report on their behalf.\nThey replied that their LMS does not allow for any reports to be exported. This is where the misunderstanding occurred.\nEarlier in the project, it was interpreted that they were not getting the desired information from SCORM 1.2 completion reports. That is why we decided to proceed with SCORM 2004 as it allows for customized reportage.\nWe have asked Del Monte to confirm with their LMS, Convercent, what type of reports or metadata can be generated or exported. Awaiting a response here.\nQuestions to discuss:\nIs there any way to run a report on behalf\u00a0of Del Monte?\nHave reporting capabilities been brought up in the prior year updates for Del Monte? If so, what was the recommendation?\nThanks!\n_________________________\nDiligent\nRandi Mooney (Doran),\n\u00a0she/her\nAdvisory Specialist II, Advisory & Consulting Services\nrmooney@diligent.com\n\u00a0| \ndiligent.com\n\u00a0\nFrom:\n\u00a0Catalina De Sanctis <\nc.desanctis@lcwmail.com\n>\nSent:\n\u00a0Wednesday, January 29, 2025 7:23 PM\nTo:\n\u00a0Randi Mooney <\nrmooney@diligent.com\n>; Brian Luong <\nbluong@diligent.com\n>\nCc:\n\u00a0Don Reyes <\ndreyes@diligent.com\n>; Karen Lai <\nklai@diligent.com\n>; Kumud Mishra <\nkmishra@diligent.com\n>\nSubject:\n\u00a0RE: Diligent - WO_DELMONTE_COC_080624 - Del Monte CoC\n\u00a0\nHello Randi,\nIm sorry, tomorrow is complicated.

We can adjust the\u00a0package to give them scores or try to adapt to their system of distinguishing learners with such limited LMS reporting features. But as shown with our testing, the packages have worked and we'll need their LMS to send us the exact settings that will be needed to accompany Del Monte's method of how they plan to distinguish learners who said Yes or No on the questionnaire.\u00a0\n\u00a0\nPerhaps their system only shows a complete pass/fail scenario? We'd need guidance from their LMS on how scores are captured and if it can distinguish a 50% score that \"fails\" but still passes the course.\u00a0\n\u00a0\nPlease note our so long back and forth comes from their limiting system and as you can notice we are flexible and doing our best to help them get what they need.\nPlease let us know.\nWe are happy to help.\nBest,\nCDS\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\nCatalina De Sanctis\nTranslation Specialist\nLCW\n<image003.png>\n\u00a0\nWebsite\n\u00a0| \nTwitter\n\u00a0| \nFacebook\n\u00a0| \nLinkedIn\nView our upcoming events\n\u00a0| \nSign-up for our newsletter\n\u00a0\nFrom:\n\u00a0Randi Mooney <\nrmooney@diligent.com\n>\nSent:\n\u00a0Thursday, February 20, 2025 1:49 PM\nTo:\n\u00a0Catalina De Sanctis <\nc.desanctis@lcwmail.com\n>\nCc:\n\u00a0Brian Luong <\nbluong@diligent.com\n>; Don Reyes <\ndreyes@diligent.com\n>; Karen Lai <\nklai@diligent.com\n>; Kumud Mishra <\nkmishra@diligent.com\n>; Jorgelina Venturi <\nj.venturi@lcwmail.com\n>\nSubject:\n\u00a0Re: Diligent - WO_DELMONTE_COC_080624 - Del Monte CoC\n\u00a0\nHello,\n\u00a0\nDel Monte will be following up with their LMS on this matter.

This method involves the least amount of scope increase since we're at the translation phase. See below for what I did to the package to relay to them. Then can use the Menu to skip to the Certification slide to test both clickable decisions.\n\u00a0\n<image019.png>\n\u00a0\nOn the screen below, when the learner selects the No, the course will complete when the final slide loads. If the learner selects Yes, then the course will register as incomplete when reaching the final slide. \nIf this is not enough for them, please have Del Monte describe how they are going to mitigate this issue for themselves internally with the limitations of their LMS, and we can adjust the package accordingly. \nSince their LMS doesn't allow the reportage they want, they need to decide how they are going to reach out to people who appear incomplete if this isn't good enough. That may even need to include adding language to the course that would then need translation. Reconfiguration/Testing of the course for numerical scores to be sent to signal the selected response in question, would take 1hr per language to adjust totaling $1400 ($140*10lg) additional to the scope on my end. The adjustment I did here would only increase the scope between $140-$280 overall to apply the fix.\n<image020.png>\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\nPlease let us know your comments.\nThanks!\nCDS\n\u00a0\nCatalina De Sanctis\nTranslation Specialist\nLCW\n<image021.png>\n\u00a0\nWebsite\n\u00a0| \nTwitter\n\u00a0| \nFacebook\n\u00a0| \nLinkedIn\nView our upcoming events\n\u00a0| \nSign-up for our newsletter\n\u00a0\nFrom:\n\u00a0Randi Mooney <\nrmooney@diligent.com\n>\nSent:\n\u00a0Tuesday, February 11, 2025 2:31 PM\nTo:\n\u00a0Catalina De Sanctis <\nc.desanctis@lcwmail.com\n>\nCc:\n\u00a0Brian Luong <\nbluong@diligent.com\n>; Don Reyes <\ndreyes@diligent.com\n>; Karen Lai <\nklai@diligent.com\n>; Kumud Mishra <\nkmishra@diligent.com\n>\nSubject:\n\u00a0Re: Diligent - WO_DELMONTE_COC_080624 - Del Monte CoC\n\u00a0\nHi Catalina,\n\u00a0\nI wanted to follow up to see if Dustin's new test file for Del Monte is ready?

But in the meantime, sent over an invite for Friday.\n\u00a0\nHere is a summary of the situation:\nDel Monte noted earlier this week that the SCORM 2004 test file worked well in their LMS but followed up asking if we could send them their test report.\nWe informed them that without explicit access to their LMS and metadata, it would not be possible to generate a report on their behalf.\nThey replied that their LMS does not allow for any reports to be exported. This is where the misunderstanding occurred.\nEarlier in the project, it was interpreted that they were not getting the desired information from SCORM 1.2 completion reports. That is why we decided to proceed with SCORM 2004 as it allows for customized reportage.\nWe have asked Del Monte to confirm with their LMS, Convercent, what type of reports or metadata can be generated or exported. Awaiting a response here.\nQuestions to discuss:\nIs there any way to run a report on behalf\u00a0of Del Monte?\nHave reporting capabilities been brought up in the prior year updates for Del Monte? If so, what was the recommendation?\nThanks!\n_________________________\nDiligent\nRandi Mooney (Doran),\n\u00a0she/her\nAdvisory Specialist II, Advisory & Consulting Services\nrmooney@diligent.com\n\u00a0| \ndiligent.com\n\u00a0\nFrom:\n\u00a0Catalina De Sanctis <\nc.desanctis@lcwmail.com\n>\nSent:\n\u00a0Wednesday, January 29, 2025 7:23 PM\nTo:\n\u00a0Randi Mooney <\nrmooney@diligent.com\n>; Brian Luong <\nbluong@diligent.com\n>\nCc:\n\u00a0Don Reyes <\ndreyes@diligent.com\n>; Karen Lai <\nklai@diligent.com\n>; Kumud Mishra <\nkmishra@diligent.com\n>\nSubject:\n\u00a0RE: Diligent - WO_DELMONTE_COC_080624 - Del Monte CoC\n\u00a0\nHello Randi,\nIm sorry, tomorrow is complicated.

We can adjust the\u00a0package to give them scores or try to adapt to their system of distinguishing learners with such limited LMS reporting features. But as shown with our testing, the packages have worked and we'll need their LMS to send us the exact settings that will be needed to accompany Del Monte's method of how they plan to distinguish learners who said Yes or No on the questionnaire.\u00a0\n\u00a0\nPerhaps their system only shows a complete pass/fail scenario? We'd need guidance from their LMS on how scores are captured and if it can distinguish a 50% score that \"fails\" but still passes the course.\u00a0\n\u00a0\nPlease note our so long back and forth comes from their limiting system and as you can notice we are flexible and doing our best to help them get what they need.\nPlease let us know.\nWe are happy to help.\nBest,\nCDS\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\nCatalina De Sanctis\nTranslation Specialist\nLCW\n<image003.png>\n\u00a0\nWebsite\n\u00a0| \nTwitter\n\u00a0| \nFacebook\n\u00a0| \nLinkedIn\nView our upcoming events\n\u00a0| \nSign-up for our newsletter\n\u00a0\nFrom:\n\u00a0Randi Mooney <\nrmooney@diligent.com\n>\nSent:\n\u00a0Thursday, February 20, 2025 1:49 PM\nTo:\n\u00a0Catalina De Sanctis <\nc.desanctis@lcwmail.com\n>\nCc:\n\u00a0Brian Luong <\nbluong@diligent.com\n>; Don Reyes <\ndreyes@diligent.com\n>; Karen Lai <\nklai@diligent.com\n>; Kumud Mishra <\nkmishra@diligent.com\n>; Jorgelina Venturi <\nj.venturi@lcwmail.com\n>\nSubject:\n\u00a0Re: Diligent - WO_DELMONTE_COC_080624 - Del Monte CoC\n\u00a0\nHello,\n\u00a0\nDel Monte will be following up with their LMS on this matter.

This method involves the least amount of scope increase since we're at the translation phase. See below for what I did to the package to relay to them. Then can use the Menu to skip to the Certification slide to test both clickable decisions.\n\u00a0\n<image019.png>\n\u00a0\nOn the screen below, when the learner selects the No, the course will complete when the final slide loads. If the learner selects Yes, then the course will register as incomplete when reaching the final slide. \nIf this is not enough for them, please have Del Monte describe how they are going to mitigate this issue for themselves internally with the limitations of their LMS, and we can adjust the package accordingly. \nSince their LMS doesn't allow the reportage they want, they need to decide how they are going to reach out to people who appear incomplete if this isn't good enough. That may even need to include adding language to the course that would then need translation. Reconfiguration/Testing of the course for numerical scores to be sent to signal the selected response in question, would take 1hr per language to adjust totaling $1400 ($140*10lg) additional to the scope on my end. The adjustment I did here would only increase the scope between $140-$280 overall to apply the fix.\n<image020.png>\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\nPlease let us know your comments.\nThanks!\nCDS\n\u00a0\nCatalina De Sanctis\nTranslation Specialist\nLCW\n<image021.png>\n\u00a0\nWebsite\n\u00a0| \nTwitter\n\u00a0| \nFacebook\n\u00a0| \nLinkedIn\nView our upcoming events\n\u00a0| \nSign-up for our newsletter\n\u00a0\nFrom:\n\u00a0Randi Mooney <\nrmooney@diligent.com\n>\nSent:\n\u00a0Tuesday, February 11, 2025 2:31 PM\nTo:\n\u00a0Catalina De Sanctis <\nc.desanctis@lcwmail.com\n>\nCc:\n\u00a0Brian Luong <\nbluong@diligent.com\n>; Don Reyes <\ndreyes@diligent.com\n>; Karen Lai <\nklai@diligent.com\n>; Kumud Mishra <\nkmishra@diligent.com\n>\nSubject:\n\u00a0Re: Diligent - WO_DELMONTE_COC_080624 - Del Monte CoC\n\u00a0\nHi Catalina,\n\u00a0\nI wanted to follow up to see if Dustin's new test file for Del Monte is ready?

But in the meantime, sent over an invite for Friday.\n\u00a0\nHere is a summary of the situation:\nDel Monte noted earlier this week that the SCORM 2004 test file worked well in their LMS but followed up asking if we could send them their test report.\nWe informed them that without explicit access to their LMS and metadata, it would not be possible to generate a report on their behalf.\nThey replied that their LMS does not allow for any reports to be exported. This is where the misunderstanding occurred.\nEarlier in the project, it was interpreted that they were not getting the desired information from SCORM 1.2 completion reports. That is why we decided to proceed with SCORM 2004 as it allows for customized reportage.\nWe have asked Del Monte to confirm with their LMS, Convercent, what type of reports or metadata can be generated or exported. Awaiting a response here.\nQuestions to discuss:\nIs there any way to run a report on behalf\u00a0of Del Monte?\nHave reporting capabilities been brought up in the prior year updates for Del Monte? If so, what was the recommendation?\nThanks!\n_________________________\nDiligent\nRandi Mooney (Doran),\n\u00a0she/her\nAdvisory Specialist II, Advisory & Consulting Services\nrmooney@diligent.com\n\u00a0| \ndiligent.com\n\u00a0\nFrom:\n\u00a0Catalina De Sanctis <\nc.desanctis@lcwmail.com\n>\nSent:\n\u00a0Wednesday, January 29, 2025 7:23 PM\nTo:\n\u00a0Randi Mooney <\nrmooney@diligent.com\n>; Brian Luong <\nbluong@diligent.com\n>\nCc:\n\u00a0Don Reyes <\ndreyes@diligent.com\n>; Karen Lai <\nklai@diligent.com\n>; Kumud Mishra <\nkmishra@diligent.com\n>\nSubject:\n\u00a0RE: Diligent - WO_DELMONTE_COC_080624 - Del Monte CoC\n\u00a0\nHello Randi,\nIm sorry, tomorrow is complicated.

We can adjust the\u00a0package to give them scores or try to adapt to their system of distinguishing learners with such limited LMS reporting features. But as shown with our testing, the packages have worked and we'll need their LMS to send us the exact settings that will be needed to accompany Del Monte's method of how they plan to distinguish learners who said Yes or No on the questionnaire.\u00a0\n\u00a0\nPerhaps their system only shows a complete pass/fail scenario? We'd need guidance from their LMS on how scores are captured and if it can distinguish a 50% score that \"fails\" but still passes the course.\u00a0\n\u00a0\nPlease note our so long back and forth comes from their limiting system and as you can notice we are flexible and doing our best to help them get what they need.\nPlease let us know.\nWe are happy to help.\nBest,\nCDS\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\nCatalina De Sanctis\nTranslation Specialist\nLCW\n<image003.png>\n\u00a0\nWebsite\n\u00a0| \nTwitter\n\u00a0| \nFacebook\n\u00a0| \nLinkedIn\nView our upcoming events\n\u00a0| \nSign-up for our newsletter\n\u00a0\nFrom:\n\u00a0Randi Mooney <\nrmooney@diligent.com\n>\nSent:\n\u00a0Thursday, February 20, 2025 1:49 PM\nTo:\n\u00a0Catalina De Sanctis <\nc.desanctis@lcwmail.com\n>\nCc:\n\u00a0Brian Luong <\nbluong@diligent.com\n>; Don Reyes <\ndreyes@diligent.com\n>; Karen Lai <\nklai@diligent.com\n>; Kumud Mishra <\nkmishra@diligent.com\n>; Jorgelina Venturi <\nj.venturi@lcwmail.com\n>\nSubject:\n\u00a0Re: Diligent - WO_DELMONTE_COC_080624 - Del Monte CoC\n\u00a0\nHello,\n\u00a0\nDel Monte will be following up with their LMS on this matter.

The issue we have is that we can't distinguish all blank scores that are incomplete, and we don't know if in fact they completed the course. We could even be ok with a blank score if the participant was able to complete the course.\n\u00a0\nThanks,\n_________________________\nDiligent\nRandi Mooney,\n\u00a0she/her\nAdvisory Specialist II, Advisory & Consulting Services\nrmooney@diligent.com\n\u00a0| \ndiligent.com\n\u00a0\nUpcoming PTO: February 20th - February 25th",

We can adjust the\u00a0package to give them scores or try to adapt to their system of distinguishing learners with such limited LMS reporting features. But as shown with our testing, the packages have worked and we'll need their LMS to send us the exact settings that will be needed to accompany Del Monte's method of how they plan to distinguish learners who said Yes or No on the questionnaire.\u00a0\n\u00a0\nPerhaps their system only shows a complete pass/fail scenario? We'd need guidance from their LMS on how scores are captured and if it can distinguish a 50% score that \"fails\" but still passes the course.\u00a0\n\u00a0\nPlease note our so long back and forth comes from their limiting system and as you can notice we are flexible and doing our best to help them get what they need.\nPlease let us know.\nWe are happy to help.\nBest,\nCDS\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\nCatalina De Sanctis\nTranslation Specialist\nLCW\n<image003.png>\n\u00a0\nWebsite\n\u00a0| \nTwitter\n\u00a0| \nFacebook\n\u00a0| \nLinkedIn\nView our upcoming events\n\u00a0| \nSign-up for our newsletter\n\u00a0\nFrom:\n\u00a0Randi Mooney <\nrmooney@diligent.com\n>\nSent:\n\u00a0Thursday, February 20, 2025 1:49 PM\nTo:\n\u00a0Catalina De Sanctis <\nc.desanctis@lcwmail.com\n>\nCc:\n\u00a0Brian Luong <\nbluong@diligent.com\n>; Don Reyes <\ndreyes@diligent.com\n>; Karen Lai <\nklai@diligent.com\n>; Kumud Mishra <\nkmishra@diligent.com\n>; Jorgelina Venturi <\nj.venturi@lcwmail.com\n>\nSubject:\n\u00a0Re: Diligent - WO_DELMONTE_COC_080624 - Del Monte CoC\n\u00a0\nHello,\n\u00a0\nDel Monte will be following up with their LMS on this matter.

The issue we have is that we can't distinguish all blank scores that are incomplete, and we don't know if in fact they completed the course. We could even be ok with a blank score if the participant was able to complete the course.\n\u00a0\nThanks,\n_________________________\nDiligent\nRandi Mooney,\n\u00a0she/her\nAdvisory Specialist II, Advisory & Consulting Services\nrmooney@diligent.com\n\u00a0| \ndiligent.com\n\u00a0\nUpcoming PTO: February 20th - February 25th",

We can adjust the\u00a0package to give them scores or try to adapt to their system of distinguishing learners with such limited LMS reporting features. But as shown with our testing, the packages have worked and we'll need their LMS to send us the exact settings that will be needed to accompany Del Monte's method of how they plan to distinguish learners who said Yes or No on the questionnaire.\u00a0\n\u00a0\nPerhaps their system only shows a complete pass/fail scenario? We'd need guidance from their LMS on how scores are captured and if it can distinguish a 50% score that \"fails\" but still passes the course.\u00a0\n\u00a0\nPlease note our so long back and forth comes from their limiting system and as you can notice we are flexible and doing our best to help them get what they need.\nPlease let us know.\nWe are happy to help.\nBest,\nCDS\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\nCatalina De Sanctis\nTranslation Specialist\nLCW\n<image003.png>\n\u00a0\nWebsite\n\u00a0| \nTwitter\n\u00a0| \nFacebook\n\u00a0| \nLinkedIn\nView our upcoming events\n\u00a0| \nSign-up for our newsletter\n\u00a0\nFrom:\n\u00a0Randi Mooney <\nrmooney@diligent.com\n>\nSent:\n\u00a0Thursday, February 20, 2025 1:49 PM\nTo:\n\u00a0Catalina De Sanctis <\nc.desanctis@lcwmail.com\n>\nCc:\n\u00a0Brian Luong <\nbluong@diligent.com\n>; Don Reyes <\ndreyes@diligent.com\n>; Karen Lai <\nklai@diligent.com\n>; Kumud Mishra <\nkmishra@diligent.com\n>; Jorgelina Venturi <\nj.venturi@lcwmail.com\n>\nSubject:\n\u00a0Re: Diligent - WO_DELMONTE_COC_080624 - Del Monte CoC\n\u00a0\nHello,\n\u00a0\nDel Monte will be following up with their LMS on this matter. Also including another \ncomment \nDel Monte provided below:\n\u00a0\nI just sent the question to Convercent but in the screenshot shared, it showed a score of 100 for completion and a blank score for incompletion, so I don't think it is pass/fail score? The issue we have is that we can't distinguish all blank scores that are incomplete, and we don't know if in fact they completed the course. We could even be ok with a blank score if the participant was able to complete the course.\n\u00a0\nThanks,\n_________________________\nDiligent\nRandi Mooney,\n\u00a0she/her\nAdvisory Specialist II, Advisory & Consulting Services\nrmooney@diligent.com\n\u00a0| \ndiligent.com\n\u00a0\nUpcoming PTO: February 20th - February 25th",

If you need something from me, please email me\n \nI think we should keep our \ncall with Diligent on Tues\n, even if we don't have anything open. I want them to know we are committed to them & available to them.\n \nSure thing, I thought they only needed us if anything in progress\nI think you should still send the\n\u00a0Excel doc/summary\n\u00a0to the Diligent team on Monday (or prior to the Tues call) and list anything that has been recently completed or is outstanding. For example, this GXO Quote is s\ntill awaiting a response from Diligent/GXO \nhttps://lcw.scoro.com/quotes/view/1565\n.\u00a0\nIs there any quote im not awaere of? Ill share it on Monday for sure!\nDustin lateness\n\u00a0- regarding him being late with the last project... \nIt would be great if we could be more proactive with Diligent. For example, if you see that Dustin is late, proactively reach out to him to find out what's going on & then report back to the client \nbefore \nthey have the chance to follow up with us \n\ud83d\ude42\n. \nI'd rather us reach out first to explain the delay than them coming to us.\n \nYou are right, keep this in mind\nDustin processes\n\u00a0- up to you, but just a thought... \nMaybe it would be easier for Dustin to create the process docs first, and then you have a chat with him to discuss?? Again, this is totally up to you. I'm just thinking that maybe that would be better than you writing everything up. You could give him 1 process to do (like Diligent Code of Conduct), review it, re-work the formatting, make sure if has everything you need, talk to him about it... And then once the format is agreed upon & he understands what info he needs to give you, then he can do the other docs.\nI'm not trying to micromanage here... It really is just a suggestion. But feel free to do it however you want. \nI may not be able to join the calls bc my schedule has been crazy\n! I agree, I need to understand what he does because im still lost there ill reach out to him now and cc you there.\nI did not forget about \nonboarding docs for translators\n. \nWill look at that by next week. \nWill try to get to it this morning.\n \nNo rush on this!!\n\u00a0\nLMK if you have any questions/thoughts.\nThank you Cecilia!\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\nNicole Barile\n\u00a0\n(She/Her)\nChief Operating Officer\nLCW\n\u00a0\n<image002.png>\nWebsite\n\u00a0\n|\n\u00a0\nTwitter\n\u00a0\n|\n\u00a0\nFacebook\n\u00a0\n|\n\u00a0\nLinkedIn\nView our upcoming events\n\u00a0| \nSign-up for our newsletter",

We can adjust the\u00a0package to give them scores or try to adapt to their system of distinguishing learners with such limited LMS reporting features. But as shown with our testing, the packages have worked and we'll need their LMS to send us the exact settings that will be needed to accompany Del Monte's method of how they plan to distinguish learners who said Yes or No on the questionnaire.\u00a0\n\u00a0\nPerhaps their system only shows a complete pass/fail scenario? We'd need guidance from their LMS on how scores are captured and if it can distinguish a 50% score that \"fails\" but still passes the course.\u00a0\n\u00a0\nPlease note our so long back and forth comes from their limiting system and as you can notice we are flexible and doing our best to help them get what they need.\nPlease let us know.\nWe are happy to help.\nBest,\nCDS\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\nCatalina De Sanctis\nTranslation Specialist\nLCW\n<image003.png>\n\u00a0\nWebsite\n\u00a0| \nTwitter\n\u00a0| \nFacebook\n\u00a0| \nLinkedIn\nView our upcoming events\n\u00a0| \nSign-up for our newsletter\n\u00a0\nFrom:\n\u00a0Randi Mooney <\nrmooney@diligent.com\n>\nSent:\n\u00a0Thursday, February 20, 2025 1:49 PM\nTo:\n\u00a0Catalina De Sanctis <\nc.desanctis@lcwmail.com\n>\nCc:\n\u00a0Brian Luong <\nbluong@diligent.com\n>; Don Reyes <\ndreyes@diligent.com\n>; Karen Lai <\nklai@diligent.com\n>; Kumud Mishra <\nkmishra@diligent.com\n>; Jorgelina Venturi <\nj.venturi@lcwmail.com\n>\nSubject:\n\u00a0Re: Diligent - WO_DELMONTE_COC_080624 - Del Monte CoC\n\u00a0\nHello,\n\u00a0\nDel Monte will be following up with their LMS on this matter.

The issue we have is that we can't distinguish all blank scores that are incomplete, and we don't know if in fact they completed the course.

This method involves the least amount of scope increase since we're at the translation phase. See below for what I did to the package to relay to them. Then can use the Menu to skip to the Certification slide to test both clickable decisions.\n\u00a0\n<image019.png>\n\u00a0\nOn the screen below, when the learner selects the No, the course will complete when the final slide loads. If the learner selects Yes, then the course will register as incomplete when reaching the final slide. \nIf this is not enough for them, please have Del Monte describe how they are going to mitigate this issue for themselves internally with the limitations of their LMS, and we can adjust the package accordingly. \nSince their LMS doesn't allow the reportage they want, they need to decide how they are going to reach out to people who appear incomplete if this isn't good enough. That may even need to include adding language to the course that would then need translation. Reconfiguration/Testing of the course for numerical scores to be sent to signal the selected response in question, would take 1hr per language to adjust totaling $1400 ($140*10lg) additional to the scope on my end. The adjustment I did here would only increase the scope between $140-$280 overall to apply the fix.\n<image020.png>\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\nPlease let us know your comments.\nThanks!\nCDS\n\u00a0\nCatalina De Sanctis\nTranslation Specialist\nLCW\n<image021.png>\n\u00a0\nWebsite\n\u00a0| \nTwitter\n\u00a0| \nFacebook\n\u00a0| \nLinkedIn\nView our upcoming events\n\u00a0| \nSign-up for our newsletter\n\u00a0\nFrom:\n\u00a0Randi Mooney <\nrmooney@diligent.com\n>\nSent:\n\u00a0Tuesday, February 11, 2025 2:31 PM\nTo:\n\u00a0Catalina De Sanctis <\nc.desanctis@lcwmail.com\n>\nCc:\n\u00a0Brian Luong <\nbluong@diligent.com\n>; Don Reyes <\ndreyes@diligent.com\n>; Karen Lai <\nklai@diligent.com\n>; Kumud Mishra <\nkmishra@diligent.com\n>\nSubject:\n\u00a0Re: Diligent - WO_DELMONTE_COC_080624 - Del Monte CoC\n\u00a0\nHi Catalina,\n\u00a0\nI wanted to follow up to see if Dustin's new test file for Del Monte is ready?

But in the meantime, sent over an invite for Friday.\n\u00a0\nHere is a summary of the situation:\nDel Monte noted earlier this week that the SCORM 2004 test file worked well in their LMS but followed up asking if we could send them their test report.\nWe informed them that without explicit access to their LMS and metadata, it would not be possible to generate a report on their behalf.\nThey replied that their LMS does not allow for any reports to be exported. This is where the misunderstanding occurred.\nEarlier in the project, it was interpreted that they were not getting the desired information from SCORM 1.2 completion reports. That is why we decided to proceed with SCORM 2004 as it allows for customized reportage.\nWe have asked Del Monte to confirm with their LMS, Convercent, what type of reports or metadata can be generated or exported. Awaiting a response here.\nQuestions to discuss:\nIs there any way to run a report on behalf\u00a0of Del Monte?\nHave reporting capabilities been brought up in the prior year updates for Del Monte? If so, what was the recommendation?\nThanks!\n_________________________\nDiligent\nRandi Mooney (Doran),\n\u00a0she/her\nAdvisory Specialist II, Advisory & Consulting Services\nrmooney@diligent.com\n\u00a0| \ndiligent.com\n\u00a0\nFrom:\n\u00a0Catalina De Sanctis <\nc.desanctis@lcwmail.com\n>\nSent:\n\u00a0Wednesday, January 29, 2025 7:23 PM\nTo:\n\u00a0Randi Mooney <\nrmooney@diligent.com\n>; Brian Luong <\nbluong@diligent.com\n>\nCc:\n\u00a0Don Reyes <\ndreyes@diligent.com\n>; Karen Lai <\nklai@diligent.com\n>; Kumud Mishra <\nkmishra@diligent.com\n>\nSubject:\n\u00a0RE: Diligent - WO_DELMONTE_COC_080624 - Del Monte CoC\n\u00a0\nHello Randi,\nIm sorry, tomorrow is complicated.

We can adjust the\u00a0package to give them scores or try to adapt to their system of distinguishing learners with such limited LMS reporting features. But as shown with our testing, the packages have worked and we'll need their LMS to send us the exact settings that will be needed to accompany Del Monte's method of how they plan to distinguish learners who said Yes or No on the questionnaire.\u00a0\n\u00a0\nPerhaps their system only shows a complete pass/fail scenario? We'd need guidance from their LMS on how scores are captured and if it can distinguish a 50% score that \"fails\" but still passes the course.\u00a0\n\u00a0\nPlease note our so long back and forth comes from their limiting system and as you can notice we are flexible and doing our best to help them get what they need.\nPlease let us know.\nWe are happy to help.\nBest,\nCDS\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\nCatalina De Sanctis\nTranslation Specialist\nLCW\n<image003.png>\n\u00a0\nWebsite\n\u00a0| \nTwitter\n\u00a0| \nFacebook\n\u00a0| \nLinkedIn\nView our upcoming events\n\u00a0| \nSign-up for our newsletter\n\u00a0\nFrom:\n\u00a0Randi Mooney <\nrmooney@diligent.com\n>\nSent:\n\u00a0Thursday, February 20, 2025 1:49 PM\nTo:\n\u00a0Catalina De Sanctis <\nc.desanctis@lcwmail.com\n>\nCc:\n\u00a0Brian Luong <\nbluong@diligent.com\n>; Don Reyes <\ndreyes@diligent.com\n>; Karen Lai <\nklai@diligent.com\n>; Kumud Mishra <\nkmishra@diligent.com\n>; Jorgelina Venturi <\nj.venturi@lcwmail.com\n>\nSubject:\n\u00a0Re: Diligent - WO_DELMONTE_COC_080624 - Del Monte CoC\n\u00a0\nHello,\n\u00a0\nDel Monte will be following up with their LMS on this matter.

The issue we have is that we can't distinguish all blank scores that are incomplete, and we don't know if in fact they completed the course.

We can adjust the\u00a0package to give them scores or try to adapt to their system of distinguishing learners with such limited LMS reporting features. But as shown with our testing, the packages have worked and we'll need their LMS to send us the exact settings that will be needed to accompany Del Monte's method of how they plan to distinguish learners who said Yes or No on the questionnaire.\u00a0\n\u00a0\nPerhaps their system only shows a complete pass/fail scenario? We'd need guidance from their LMS on how scores are captured and if it can distinguish a 50% score that \"fails\" but still passes the course.\u00a0\n\u00a0\nPlease note our so long back and forth comes from their limiting system and as you can notice we are flexible and doing our best to help them get what they need.\nPlease let us know.\nWe are happy to help.\nBest,\nCDS\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\nCatalina De Sanctis\nTranslation Specialist\nLCW\n<image003.png>\n\u00a0\nWebsite\n\u00a0| \nTwitter\n\u00a0| \nFacebook\n\u00a0| \nLinkedIn\nView our upcoming events\n\u00a0| \nSign-up for our newsletter\n\u00a0\nFrom:\n\u00a0Randi Mooney <\nrmooney@diligent.com\n>\nSent:\n\u00a0Thursday, February 20, 2025 1:49 PM\nTo:\n\u00a0Catalina De Sanctis <\nc.desanctis@lcwmail.com\n>\nCc:\n\u00a0Brian Luong <\nbluong@diligent.com\n>; Don Reyes <\ndreyes@diligent.com\n>; Karen Lai <\nklai@diligent.com\n>; Kumud Mishra <\nkmishra@diligent.com\n>; Jorgelina Venturi <\nj.venturi@lcwmail.com\n>\nSubject:\n\u00a0Re: Diligent - WO_DELMONTE_COC_080624 - Del Monte CoC\n\u00a0\nHello,\n\u00a0\nDel Monte will be following up with their LMS on this matter. Also including another \ncomment \nDel Monte provided below:\n\u00a0\nI just sent the question to Convercent but in the screenshot shared, it showed a score of 100 for completion and a blank score for incompletion, so I don't think it is pass/fail score? The issue we have is that we can't distinguish all blank scores that are incomplete, and we don't know if in fact they completed the course. We could even be ok with a blank score if the participant was able to complete the course.\n\u00a0\nThanks,\n_________________________\nDiligent\nRandi Mooney,\n\u00a0she/her\nAdvisory Specialist II, Advisory & Consulting Services\nrmooney@diligent.com\n\u00a0| \ndiligent.com\n\u00a0\nUpcoming PTO: February 20th - February 25th\n\u00a0\nFrom:\n\u00a0Catalina De Sanctis <\nc.desanctis@lcwmail.com\n>\nSent:\n\u00a0Thursday, February 20, 2025 9:56 AM\nTo:\n\u00a0Randi Mooney <\nrmooney@diligent.com\n>\nCc:\n\u00a0Brian Luong <\nbluong@diligent.com\n>; Don Reyes <\ndreyes@diligent.com\n>; Karen Lai <\nklai@diligent.com\n>; Kumud Mishra <\nkmishra@diligent.com\n>; Jorgelina Venturi <\nj.venturi@lcwmail.com\n>\nSubject:\n\u00a0RE: Diligent - WO_DELMONTE_COC_080624 - Del Monte CoC\n\u00a0\nEXTERNAL:\u00a0This email originated from outside of the organization.

We can adjust the\u00a0package to give them scores or try to adapt to their system of distinguishing learners with such limited LMS reporting features. But as shown with our testing, the packages have worked and we'll need their LMS to send us the exact settings that will be needed to accompany Del Monte's method of how they plan to distinguish learners who said Yes or No on the questionnaire.\u00a0\n\u00a0\nPerhaps their system only shows a complete pass/fail scenario? We'd need guidance from their LMS on how scores are captured and if it can distinguish a 50% score that \"fails\" but still passes the course.\u00a0\n\u00a0\nPlease note our so long back and forth comes from their limiting system and as you can notice we are flexible and doing our best to help them get what they need.\nPlease let us know.\nWe are happy to help.\nBest,\nCDS\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\nCatalina De Sanctis\nTranslation Specialist\nLCW\n<image003.png>\n\u00a0\nWebsite\n\u00a0| \nTwitter\n\u00a0| \nFacebook\n\u00a0| \nLinkedIn\nView our upcoming events\n\u00a0| \nSign-up for our newsletter\n\u00a0\nFrom:\n\u00a0Randi Mooney <\nrmooney@diligent.com\n>\nSent:\n\u00a0Thursday, February 20, 2025 1:49 PM\nTo:\n\u00a0Catalina De Sanctis <\nc.desanctis@lcwmail.com\n>\nCc:\n\u00a0Brian Luong <\nbluong@diligent.com\n>; Don Reyes <\ndreyes@diligent.com\n>; Karen Lai <\nklai@diligent.com\n>; Kumud Mishra <\nkmishra@diligent.com\n>; Jorgelina Venturi <\nj.venturi@lcwmail.com\n>\nSubject:\n\u00a0Re: Diligent - WO_DELMONTE_COC_080624 - Del Monte CoC\n\u00a0\nHello,\n\u00a0\nDel Monte will be following up with their LMS on this matter.

This method involves the least amount of scope increase since we're at the translation phase. See below for what I did to the package to relay to them. Then can use the Menu to skip to the Certification slide to test both clickable decisions.\n\u00a0\n<image019.png>\n\u00a0\nOn the screen below, when the learner selects the No, the course will complete when the final slide loads. If the learner selects Yes, then the course will register as incomplete when reaching the final slide. \nIf this is not enough for them, please have Del Monte describe how they are going to mitigate this issue for themselves internally with the limitations of their LMS, and we can adjust the package accordingly. \nSince their LMS doesn't allow the reportage they want, they need to decide how they are going to reach out to people who appear incomplete if this isn't good enough. That may even need to include adding language to the course that would then need translation. Reconfiguration/Testing of the course for numerical scores to be sent to signal the selected response in question, would take 1hr per language to adjust totaling $1400 ($140*10lg) additional to the scope on my end. The adjustment I did here would only increase the scope between $140-$280 overall to apply the fix.\n<image020.png>\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\nPlease let us know your comments.\nThanks!\nCDS\n\u00a0\nCatalina De Sanctis\nTranslation Specialist\nLCW\n<image021.png>\n\u00a0\nWebsite\n\u00a0| \nTwitter\n\u00a0| \nFacebook\n\u00a0| \nLinkedIn\nView our upcoming events\n\u00a0| \nSign-up for our newsletter\n\u00a0\nFrom:\n\u00a0Randi Mooney <\nrmooney@diligent.com\n>\nSent:\n\u00a0Tuesday, February 11, 2025 2:31 PM\nTo:\n\u00a0Catalina De Sanctis <\nc.desanctis@lcwmail.com\n>\nCc:\n\u00a0Brian Luong <\nbluong@diligent.com\n>; Don Reyes <\ndreyes@diligent.com\n>; Karen Lai <\nklai@diligent.com\n>; Kumud Mishra <\nkmishra@diligent.com\n>\nSubject:\n\u00a0Re: Diligent - WO_DELMONTE_COC_080624 - Del Monte CoC\n\u00a0\nHi Catalina,\n\u00a0\nI wanted to follow up to see if Dustin's new test file for Del Monte is ready?

But in the meantime, sent over an invite for Friday.\n\u00a0\nHere is a summary of the situation:\nDel Monte noted earlier this week that the SCORM 2004 test file worked well in their LMS but followed up asking if we could send them their test report.\nWe informed them that without explicit access to their LMS and metadata, it would not be possible to generate a report on their behalf.\nThey replied that their LMS does not allow for any reports to be exported. This is where the misunderstanding occurred.\nEarlier in the project, it was interpreted that they were not getting the desired information from SCORM 1.2 completion reports. That is why we decided to proceed with SCORM 2004 as it allows for customized reportage.\nWe have asked Del Monte to confirm with their LMS, Convercent, what type of reports or metadata can be generated or exported. Awaiting a response here.\nQuestions to discuss:\nIs there any way to run a report on behalf\u00a0of Del Monte?\nHave reporting capabilities been brought up in the prior year updates for Del Monte? If so, what was the recommendation?\nThanks!\n_________________________\nDiligent\nRandi Mooney (Doran),\n\u00a0she/her\nAdvisory Specialist II, Advisory & Consulting Services\nrmooney@diligent.com\n\u00a0| \ndiligent.com\n\u00a0\nFrom:\n\u00a0Catalina De Sanctis <\nc.desanctis@lcwmail.com\n>\nSent:\n\u00a0Wednesday, January 29, 2025 7:23 PM\nTo:\n\u00a0Randi Mooney <\nrmooney@diligent.com\n>; Brian Luong <\nbluong@diligent.com\n>\nCc:\n\u00a0Don Reyes <\ndreyes@diligent.com\n>; Karen Lai <\nklai@diligent.com\n>; Kumud Mishra <\nkmishra@diligent.com\n>\nSubject:\n\u00a0RE: Diligent - WO_DELMONTE_COC_080624 - Del Monte CoC\n\u00a0\nHello Randi,\nIm sorry, tomorrow is complicated.

If you need something from me, please email me\n \nI think we should keep our \ncall with Diligent on Tues\n, even if we don't have anything open. I want them to know we are committed to them & available to them.\n \nSure thing, I thought they only needed us if anything in progress\nI think you should still send the\n\u00a0Excel doc/summary\n\u00a0to the Diligent team on Monday (or prior to the Tues call) and list anything that has been recently completed or is outstanding. For example, this GXO Quote is s\ntill awaiting a response from Diligent/GXO \nhttps://lcw.scoro.com/quotes/view/1565\n.\u00a0\nIs there any quote im not awaere of? Ill share it on Monday for sure!\nDustin lateness\n\u00a0- regarding him being late with the last project... \nIt would be great if we could be more proactive with Diligent. For example, if you see that Dustin is late, proactively reach out to him to find out what's going on & then report back to the client \nbefore \nthey have the chance to follow up with us \n\ud83d\ude42\n. \nI'd rather us reach out first to explain the delay than them coming to us.\n \nYou are right, keep this in mind\nDustin processes\n\u00a0- up to you, but just a thought... \nMaybe it would be easier for Dustin to create the process docs first, and then you have a chat with him to discuss?? Again, this is totally up to you. I'm just thinking that maybe that would be better than you writing everything up. You could give him 1 process to do (like Diligent Code of Conduct), review it, re-work the formatting, make sure if has everything you need, talk to him about it... And then once the format is agreed upon & he understands what info he needs to give you, then he can do the other docs.\nI'm not trying to micromanage here... It really is just a suggestion. But feel free to do it however you want. \nI may not be able to join the calls bc my schedule has been crazy\n! I agree, I need to understand what he does because im still lost there ill reach out to him now and cc you there.\nI did not forget about \nonboarding docs for translators\n. \nWill look at that by next week. \nWill try to get to it this morning.\n \nNo rush on this!!\n\u00a0\nLMK if you have any questions/thoughts.\nThank you Cecilia!\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\nNicole Barile\n\u00a0\n(She/Her)\nChief Operating Officer\nLCW\n\u00a0\nWebsite\n\u00a0\n|\n\u00a0\nTwitter\n\u00a0\n|\n\u00a0\nFacebook\n\u00a0\n|\n\u00a0\nLinkedIn\nView our upcoming events\n\u00a0| \nSign-up for our newsletter",

We can adjust the\u00a0package to give them scores or try to adapt to their system of distinguishing learners with such limited LMS reporting features. But as shown with our testing, the packages have worked and we'll need their LMS to send us the exact settings that will be needed to accompany Del Monte's method of how they plan to distinguish learners who said Yes or No on the questionnaire.\u00a0\n\u00a0\nPerhaps their system only shows a complete pass/fail scenario? We'd need guidance from their LMS on how scores are captured and if it can distinguish a 50% score that \"fails\" but still passes the course.\u00a0\n\u00a0\nPlease note our so long back and forth comes from their limiting system and as you can notice we are flexible and doing our best to help them get what they need.\nPlease let us know.\nWe are happy to help.\nBest,\nCDS\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\nCatalina De Sanctis\nTranslation Specialist\nLCW\n<image003.png>\n\u00a0\nWebsite\n\u00a0| \nTwitter\n\u00a0| \nFacebook\n\u00a0| \nLinkedIn\nView our upcoming events\n\u00a0| \nSign-up for our newsletter\n\u00a0\nFrom:\n\u00a0Randi Mooney <rmooney@diligent.com>\nSent:\n\u00a0Thursday, February 20, 2025 1:49 PM\nTo:\n\u00a0Catalina De Sanctis <c.desanctis@lcwmail.com>\nCc:\n\u00a0Brian Luong <bluong@diligent.com>; Don Reyes <dreyes@diligent.com>; Karen Lai <klai@diligent.com>; Kumud Mishra <kmishra@diligent.com>; Jorgelina Venturi <j.venturi@lcwmail.com>\nSubject:\n\u00a0Re: Diligent - WO_DELMONTE_COC_080624 - Del Monte CoC\n\u00a0\nHello,\n\u00a0\nDel Monte will be following up with their LMS on this matter.

This method involves the least amount of scope increase since we're at the translation phase. See below for what I did to the package to relay to them. Then can use the Menu to skip to the Certification slide to test both clickable decisions.\n\u00a0\n<image019.png>\n\u00a0\nOn the screen below, when the learner selects the No, the course will complete when the final slide loads. If the learner selects Yes, then the course will register as incomplete when reaching the final slide. \nIf this is not enough for them, please have Del Monte describe how they are going to mitigate this issue for themselves internally with the limitations of their LMS, and we can adjust the package accordingly. \nSince their LMS doesn't allow the reportage they want, they need to decide how they are going to reach out to people who appear incomplete if this isn't good enough. That may even need to include adding language to the course that would then need translation. Reconfiguration/Testing of the course for numerical scores to be sent to signal the selected response in question, would take 1hr per language to adjust totaling $1400 ($140*10lg) additional to the scope on my end. The adjustment I did here would only increase the scope between $140-$280 overall to apply the fix.\n<image020.png>\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\nPlease let us know your comments.\nThanks!\nCDS\n\u00a0\nCatalina De Sanctis\nTranslation Specialist\nLCW\n<image021.png>\n\u00a0\nWebsite\n\u00a0| \nTwitter\n\u00a0| \nFacebook\n\u00a0| \nLinkedIn\nView our upcoming events\n\u00a0| \nSign-up for our newsletter\n\u00a0\nFrom:\n\u00a0Randi Mooney <\nrmooney@diligent.com\n>\nSent:\n\u00a0Tuesday, February 11, 2025 2:31 PM\nTo:\n\u00a0Catalina De Sanctis <\nc.desanctis@lcwmail.com\n>\nCc:\n\u00a0Brian Luong <\nbluong@diligent.com\n>; Don Reyes <\ndreyes@diligent.com\n>; Karen Lai <\nklai@diligent.com\n>; Kumud Mishra <\nkmishra@diligent.com\n>\nSubject:\n\u00a0Re: Diligent - WO_DELMONTE_COC_080624 - Del Monte CoC\n\u00a0\nHi Catalina,\n\u00a0\nI wanted to follow up to see if Dustin's new test file for Del Monte is ready?

But in the meantime, sent over an invite for Friday.\n\u00a0\nHere is a summary of the situation:\nDel Monte noted earlier this week that the SCORM 2004 test file worked well in their LMS but followed up asking if we could send them their test report.\nWe informed them that without explicit access to their LMS and metadata, it would not be possible to generate a report on their behalf.\nThey replied that their LMS does not allow for any reports to be exported. This is where the misunderstanding occurred.\nEarlier in the project, it was interpreted that they were not getting the desired information from SCORM 1.2 completion reports. That is why we decided to proceed with SCORM 2004 as it allows for customized reportage.\nWe have asked Del Monte to confirm with their LMS, Convercent, what type of reports or metadata can be generated or exported. Awaiting a response here.\nQuestions to discuss:\nIs there any way to run a report on behalf\u00a0of Del Monte?\nHave reporting capabilities been brought up in the prior year updates for Del Monte? If so, what was the recommendation?\nThanks!\n_________________________\nDiligent\nRandi Mooney (Doran),\n\u00a0she/her\nAdvisory Specialist II, Advisory & Consulting Services\nrmooney@diligent.com\n\u00a0| \ndiligent.com\n\u00a0\nFrom:\n\u00a0Catalina De Sanctis <\nc.desanctis@lcwmail.com\n>\nSent:\n\u00a0Wednesday, January 29, 2025 7:23 PM\nTo:\n\u00a0Randi Mooney <\nrmooney@diligent.com\n>; Brian Luong <\nbluong@diligent.com\n>\nCc:\n\u00a0Don Reyes <\ndreyes@diligent.com\n>; Karen Lai <\nklai@diligent.com\n>; Kumud Mishra <\nkmishra@diligent.com\n>\nSubject:\n\u00a0RE: Diligent - WO_DELMONTE_COC_080624 - Del Monte CoC\n\u00a0\nHello Randi,\nIm sorry, tomorrow is complicated.

    "body": "Hi Cecilia,\nHappy Friday!\nA few notes:\nI will be \nout of the office\n\u00a0this afternoon & Monday, but I will check emails. If you need something from me, please email me\nI think we should keep our \ncall with Diligent on Tues\n, even if we don't have anything open. I want them to know we are committed to them & available to them.\nI think you should still send the\n\u00a0Excel doc/summary\n\u00a0to the Diligent team on Monday (or prior to the Tues call) and list anything that has been recently completed or is outstanding. For example, this GXO Quote is still awaiting a response from Diligent/GXO \nhttps://lcw.scoro.com/quotes/view/1565\n.\u00a0\nDustin lateness\n\u00a0- regarding him being late with the last project... It would be great if we could be more proactive with Diligent. For example, if you see that Dustin is late, proactively reach out to him to find out what's going on & then report back to the client \nbefore \nthey have the chance to follow up with us \ud83d\ude42. I'd rather us reach out first to explain the delay than them coming to us.\nDustin processes\n\u00a0- up to you, but just a thought... Maybe it would be easier for Dustin to create the process docs first, and then you have a chat with him to discuss?? Again, this is totally up to you. I'm just thinking that maybe that would be better than you writing everything up. You could give him 1 process to do (like Diligent Code of Conduct), review it, re-work the formatting, make sure if has everything you need, talk to him about it... And then once the format is agreed upon & he understands what info he needs to give you, then he can do the other docs.\nI'm not trying to micromanage here... It really is just a suggestion. But feel free to do it however you want. I may not be able to join the calls bc my schedule has been crazy!\nI did not forget about \nonboarding docs for translators\n. Will look at that by next week. Will try to get to it this morning.\nLMK if you have any questions/thoughts.\nThank you Cecilia!\nNicole Barile\n\u00a0\n(She/Her)\nChief Operating Officer\nLCW\nWebsite\n\u00a0\n|\n\u00a0\nTwitter\n\u00a0\n|\n\u00a0\nFacebook\n\u00a0\n|\n\u00a0\nLinkedIn\nView our upcoming events\n\u00a0| \nSign-up for our newsletter",

There must be a misunderstanding here because I was quoted $1300 per language to get the deck fully translated (no speaker notes, just the slides plus the video subtitling). Please see attached email thread with Catalina. \n\u00a0\nSo the client is definitely expecting the cost to be less than $1300 per language. If you\u2019d like we can get on a call to clarify the project?

There must be a misunderstanding here because I was quoted $1300 per language to get the deck fully translated (no speaker notes, just the slides plus the video subtitling). Please see attached email thread with Catalina. \n\u00a0\nSo the client is definitely expecting the cost to be less than $1300 per language. If you\u2019d like we can get on a call to clarify the project?

There must be a misunderstanding here because I was quoted $1300 per language to get the deck fully translated (no speaker notes, just the slides plus the video subtitling). Please see attached email thread with Catalina. \n\u00a0\nSo the client is definitely expecting the cost to be less than $1300 per language. If you\u2019d like we can get on a call to clarify the project?

There must be a misunderstanding here because I was quoted $1300 per language to get the deck fully translated (no speaker notes, just the slides plus the video subtitling). Please see attached email thread with Catalina. \n\u00a0\nSo the client is definitely expecting the cost to be less than $1300 per language.

(I mention this because it can be confusing what they will do and what we will do)\u00a0 \nWe will just QA and not translate anything. Let\u2019s assume we\u2019re not creating subtitles.\nThe QA will involve: PDFS and VIDEOS.

Even when I download the video from the workshop deck (which is 8:42) it provides me with the longer 13:25 version!\nThere is also a Quiz on Zoom which would also need translation (see attached for English).\n\u00a0\nWe\u2019d be QAing \nthe slides only (not the speaker notes\n, they will not translate those) and the \nvideos would need subtitles only\n. \n\u00a0\nAnd how much do we typically pay reviewers to do this?\n\u00a0\nGracias!\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\nRebecca M.

However, the invoice also needs to be fully filled out \u2013 Diligent has a long list of people who need to be on the email which needs to be in the invoice (see previous ones) and the \u201cPO needed\u201d field needs to be filled out. If I get an invoice that\u2019s missing info, I\u2019ll reset the status to \u201cawaiting PO\u201d and send an email that it needs fixing (which is this email right now). Once you add that information you can set it as \u201cready to invoice\u201d again.\n\u00a0\nBTW, per Alisa I\u2019m not sending new invoices right now, but anything that\u2019s ready will wait in my to-do bucket until I get the OK to resume.\n\u00a0\nSG\n\u00a0\nFrom:\n Nicole Barile <\nn.barile@lcwmail.com\n> \nSent:\n Wednesday, March 19, 2025 11:00\nTo:\n Accounting <\naccounting@lcwmail.com\n>\nCc:\n Cecilia Mariotta <\nc.mariotta@lcwmail.com\n>\nSubject:\n Translation invoice ready\n\u00a0\nHi SG,\nI'm helping Cecilia out & don't fully understand the GLS (global lang services) invoicing process.\n\u00a0\nThis quote just completed: \nhttps://lcw.scoro.com/quotes/view/1569\n\u00a0\nI created this invoice in Scoro (not sure if I did it right): \nhttps://lcw.scoro.com/invoices/view/1524\n\u00a0\nDo I need to email you to notify you that something is completed for GLS, or is creating the invoice enough (when I mark it \"ready to invoice\")?\n\u00a0\nThanks!\n\u00a0\nNicole Barile\n\u00a0\n(She/Her)\nChief Operating Officer\nLCW\n\u00a0\nWebsite\n\u00a0\n|\n\u00a0\nTwitter\n\u00a0\n|\n\u00a0\nFacebook\n\u00a0\n|\n\u00a0\nLinkedIn\nView our upcoming events\n\u00a0| \nSign-up for our newsletter",

However, the invoice also needs to be fully filled out \u2013 Diligent has a long list of people who need to be on the email which needs to be in the invoice (see previous ones) and the \u201cPO needed\u201d field needs to be filled out. If I get an invoice that\u2019s missing info, I\u2019ll reset the status to \u201cawaiting PO\u201d and send an email that it needs fixing (which is this email right now). Once you add that information you can set it as \u201cready to invoice\u201d again.\n\u00a0\nBTW, per Alisa I\u2019m not sending new invoices right now, but anything that\u2019s ready will wait in my to-do bucket until I get the OK to resume.\n\u00a0\nSG\n\u00a0\nFrom:\n Nicole Barile <\nn.barile@lcwmail.com\n> \nSent:\n Wednesday, March 19, 2025 11:00\nTo:\n Accounting <\naccounting@lcwmail.com\n>\nCc:\n Cecilia Mariotta <\nc.mariotta@lcwmail.com\n>\nSubject:\n Translation invoice ready\n\u00a0\nHi SG,\nI'm helping Cecilia out & don't fully understand the GLS (global lang services) invoicing process.\n\u00a0\nThis quote just completed: \nhttps://lcw.scoro.com/quotes/view/1569\n\u00a0\nI created this invoice in Scoro (not sure if I did it right): \nhttps://lcw.scoro.com/invoices/view/1524\n\u00a0\nDo I need to email you to notify you that something is completed for GLS, or is creating the invoice enough (when I mark it \"ready to invoice\")?\n\u00a0\nThanks!\n\u00a0\nNicole Barile\n\u00a0\n(She/Her)\nChief Operating Officer\nLCW\n\u00a0\nWebsite\n\u00a0\n|\n\u00a0\nTwitter\n\u00a0\n|\n\u00a0\nFacebook\n\u00a0\n|\n\u00a0\nLinkedIn\nView our upcoming events\n\u00a0| \nSign-up for our newsletter",

(I mention this because it can be confusing what they will do and what we will do)\u00a0 \nWe will just QA and not translate anything. Let\u2019s assume we\u2019re not creating subtitles.\nThe QA will involve: PDFS and VIDEOS.

And reshare the files with me?\n\u00a0\nThe QA/Revision is paid per hour. I can estimate an approximate time once I have all the information.

I\u2019m speaking with Chuck and Nicole about allowing that, as long as we are able to QA the translation and approve them, keeping the integrity of the content and our intellectual property. \n\u00a0\nHow much would we typically charge a client to QA the Spanish (LatAm) and Portuguese (Brazil) translations for: \nThis PPT\n (video on slide 3 which has script in the speaker notes) and\nThis PPT\n: \nSlide 19: Video: \n\u00bfM\u00e9xico e racista o colorista?\u201d\u00a0\n \n(which came from \nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5fgOrV2uJUU\n) \n\u2013 video is on Spanish, so only needed to translate into PTB\nSlide 22: Video: \n\u00a0\u201cIndigenas Urbanos: Los desafios de los pueblos indigenas en ciudades\n\u201d (which came from \nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bl9viILCREM\n) \n\u2013 \nvideo is on Spanish, so only needed to translate into PTB\nSlide 30: Video: \u201cA Class Divided\u201d (see attached for script). \nThis video is located \nhere\n (in our Dropbox) but we only need until 8:42 (\u201c\u2026it\u2019s a horrid day\u201d). Even when I download the video from the workshop deck (which is 8:42) it provides me with the longer 13:25 version!\nThere is also a Quiz on Zoom which would also need translation (see attached for English).\n\u00a0\nWe\u2019d be QAing \nthe slides only (not the speaker notes\n, they will not translate those) and the \nvideos would need subtitles only\n. \n\u00a0\nAnd how much do we typically pay reviewers to do this?\n\u00a0\nGracias!\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\nRebecca M.

(I mention this because it can be confusing what they will do and what we will do)\u00a0 \nWe will just QA and not translate anything. Let\u2019s assume we\u2019re not creating subtitles.\nThe QA will involve: PDFS and VIDEOS. All the pdfs and the videos as indicated below and the Quiz in Zoom. \nYes.\nLanguages: Portuguese Brazil and Spanish (different scopes)\u00a0 \nYes\nCan you confirm this is correct? And reshare the files with me?\n\u00a0\nThe QA/Revision is paid per hour. I can estimate an approximate time once I have all the information. Please note that videos even when they say 8 minutes, revision takes longer as QAer or Reviewer needs to spot and add the mistakes/corrections in written so they can fix it.\n\u00a0\nOur reviewers charge: 25/30 USD per hour.\n\u00a0\nThank you!!\nCecilia \n\u00a0\nCecilia Mariotta\nTranslation Specialist\nLCW\n\u00a0\nWebsite\n\u00a0|\u00a0\nTwitter\n\u00a0|\u00a0\nFacebook\n\u00a0|\u00a0\nLinkedIn\nView our upcoming events\n\u00a0|\u00a0\nSign-up for our newsletter\n\u00a0\nDe:\n Rebecca Parrilla <\nr.parrilla@lcwmail.com\n> \nEnviado el:\n mi\u00e9rcoles, 19 de marzo de 2025 17:38\nPara:\n Cecilia Mariotta <\nc.mariotta@lcwmail.com\n>\nCC:\n Chuck Adams <\nc.adams@lcwmail.com\n>; Nicole Barile <\nn.barile@lcwmail.com\n>\nAsunto:\n how much do we pay reviewers?\n\u00a0\nHi Cecilia, how are you?\u00a0 I\u2019m talking with Boston scientific, one of our biggest clients, about allowing them to use internal translators to translate two different PPT presentations into Spanish and Portuguese. I\u2019m speaking with Chuck and Nicole about allowing that, as long as we are able to QA the translation and approve them, keeping the integrity of the content and our intellectual property. \n\u00a0\nHow much would we typically charge a client to QA the Spanish (LatAm) and Portuguese (Brazil) translations for: \nThis PPT\n (video on slide 3 which has script in the speaker notes) and\nThis PPT\n: \nSlide 19: Video: \n\u00bfM\u00e9xico e racista o colorista?\u201d\u00a0\n \n(which came from \nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5fgOrV2uJUU\n) \n\u2013 video is on Spanish, so only needed to translate into PTB\nSlide 22: Video: \n\u00a0\u201cIndigenas Urbanos: Los desafios de los pueblos indigenas en ciudades\n\u201d (which came from \nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bl9viILCREM\n) \n\u2013 \nvideo is on Spanish, so only needed to translate into PTB\nSlide 30: Video: \u201cA Class Divided\u201d (see attached for script). \nThis video is located \nhere\n (in our Dropbox) but we only need until 8:42 (\u201c\u2026it\u2019s a horrid day\u201d). Even when I download the video from the workshop deck (which is 8:42) it provides me with the longer 13:25 version!\nThere is also a Quiz on Zoom which would also need translation (see attached for English).\n\u00a0\nWe\u2019d be QAing \nthe slides only (not the speaker notes\n, they will not translate those) and the \nvideos would need subtitles only\n. \n\u00a0\nAnd how much do we typically pay reviewers to do this?\n\u00a0\nGracias!\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\nRebecca M.

(I mention this because it can be confusing what they will do and what we will do)\u00a0 \nWe will just QA and not translate anything. Let\u2019s assume we\u2019re not creating subtitles.\nThe QA will involve: PDFS and VIDEOS.

And reshare the files with me?\n\u00a0\nThe QA/Revision is paid per hour. I can estimate an approximate time once I have all the information.

I\u2019m speaking with Chuck and Nicole about allowing that, as long as we are able to QA the translation and approve them, keeping the integrity of the content and our intellectual property. \n\u00a0\nHow much would we typically charge a client to QA the Spanish (LatAm) and Portuguese (Brazil) translations for: \nThis PPT\n (video on slide 3 which has script in the speaker notes) and\nThis PPT\n: \nSlide 19: Video: \n\u00bfM\u00e9xico e racista o colorista?\u201d\u00a0\n (which came from \nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5fgOrV2uJUU\n) \n\u2013 video is on Spanish, so only needed to translate into PTB\nSlide 22: Video: \n\u00a0\u201cIndigenas Urbanos: Los desafios de los pueblos indigenas en ciudades\n\u201d (which came from \nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bl9viILCREM\n) \n\u2013 \nvideo is on Spanish, so only needed to translate into PTB\nSlide 30: Video: \u201cA Class Divided\u201d (see attached for script). \nThis video is located \nhere\n (in our Dropbox) but we only need until 8:42 (\u201c\u2026it\u2019s a horrid day\u201d). Even when I download the video from the workshop deck (which is 8:42) it provides me with the longer 13:25 version!\nThere is also a Quiz on Zoom which would also need translation (see attached for English).\n\u00a0\nWe\u2019d be QAing \nthe slides only (not the speaker notes\n, they will not translate those) and the \nvideos would need subtitles only\n. \n\u00a0\nAnd how much do we typically pay reviewers to do this?\n\u00a0\nGracias!\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\nRebecca M.

I\u2019m speaking with Chuck and Nicole about allowing that, as long as we are able to QA the translation and approve them, keeping the integrity of the content and our intellectual property. \n\u00a0\nHow much would we typically charge a client to QA the Spanish (LatAm) and Portuguese (Brazil) translations for: \nThis PPT\n (video on slide 3 which has script in the speaker notes) and\nThis PPT\n: \nSlide 19: Video: \n\u00bfM\u00e9xico e racista o colorista?\u201d\u00a0\n (which came from \nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5fgOrV2uJUU\n) \n\u2013 video is on Spanish, so only needed to translate into PTB\nSlide 22: Video: \n\u00a0\u201cIndigenas Urbanos: Los desafios de los pueblos indigenas en ciudades\n\u201d (which came from \nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bl9viILCREM\n) \n\u2013 \nvideo is on Spanish, so only needed to translate into PTB\nSlide 30: Video: \u201cA Class Divided\u201d (see attached for script). \nThis video is located \nhere\n (in our Dropbox) but we only need until 8:42 (\u201c\u2026it\u2019s a horrid day\u201d). Even when I download the video from the workshop deck (which is 8:42) it provides me with the longer 13:25 version!\nThere is also a Quiz on Zoom which would also need translation (see attached for English).\n\u00a0\nWe\u2019d be QAing \nthe slides only (not the speaker notes\n, they will not translate those) and the \nvideos would need subtitles only\n. \n\u00a0\nAnd how much do we typically pay reviewers to do this?\n\u00a0\nGracias!\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\nRebecca M.

(I mention this because it can be confusing what they will do and what we will do)\u00a0 \nWe will just QA and not translate anything. Let\u2019s assume we\u2019re not creating subtitles.\nThe QA will involve: PDFS and VIDEOS.

I\u2019m speaking with Chuck and Nicole about allowing that, as long as we are able to QA the translation and approve them, keeping the integrity of the content and our intellectual property. \n\u00a0\nHow much would we typically charge a client to QA the Spanish (LatAm) and Portuguese (Brazil) translations for: \nThis PPT\n (video on slide 3 which has script in the speaker notes) and\nThis PPT\n: \nSlide 19: Video: \n\u00bfM\u00e9xico e racista o colorista?\u201d\u00a0\n (which came from \nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5fgOrV2uJUU\n) \n\u2013 video is on Spanish, so only needed to translate into PTB\nSlide 22: Video: \n\u00a0\u201cIndigenas Urbanos: Los desafios de los pueblos indigenas en ciudades\n\u201d (which came from \nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bl9viILCREM\n) \n\u2013 \nvideo is on Spanish, so only needed to translate into PTB\nSlide 30: Video: \u201cA Class Divided\u201d (see attached for script). \nThis video is located \nhere\n (in our Dropbox) but we only need until 8:42 (\u201c\u2026it\u2019s a horrid day\u201d). Even when I download the video from the workshop deck (which is 8:42) it provides me with the longer 13:25 version!\nThere is also a Quiz on Zoom which would also need translation (see attached for English).\n\u00a0\nWe\u2019d be QAing \nthe slides only (not the speaker notes\n, they will not translate those) and the \nvideos would need subtitles only\n. \n\u00a0\nAnd how much do we typically pay reviewers to do this?\n\u00a0\nGracias!\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\nRebecca M.

If I get an invoice that\u2019s missing info, I\u2019ll reset the status to \u201cawaiting PO\u201d and send an email that it needs fixing (which is this email right now).

    "body": "Hi Cecilia, how are you?\u00a0 I\u2019m talking with Boston scientific, one of our biggest clients, about allowing them to use internal translators to translate two different PPT presentations into Spanish and Portuguese. I\u2019m speaking with Chuck and Nicole about allowing that, as long as we are able to QA the translation and approve them, keeping the integrity of the content and our intellectual property. \n\u00a0\nHow much would we typically charge a client to QA the Spanish (LatAm) and Portuguese (Brazil) translations for: \nThis PPT\n (video on slide 3 which has script in the speaker notes) and\nThis PPT\n: \nSlide 19: Video: \n\u00bfM\u00e9xico e racista o colorista?\u201d\u00a0\n (which came from \nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5fgOrV2uJUU\n) \n\u2013 video is on Spanish, so only needed to translate into PTB\nSlide 22: Video: \n\u00a0\u201cIndigenas Urbanos: Los desafios de los pueblos indigenas en ciudades\n\u201d (which came from \nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bl9viILCREM\n) \n\u2013 \nvideo is on Spanish, so only needed to translate into PTB\nSlide 30: Video: \u201cA Class Divided\u201d (see attached for script). \nThis video is located \nhere\n (in our Dropbox) but we only need until 8:42 (\u201c\u2026it\u2019s a horrid day\u201d). Even when I download the video from the workshop deck (which is 8:42) it provides me with the longer 13:25 version!\nThere is also a Quiz on Zoom which would also need translation (see attached for English).\n\u00a0\nWe\u2019d be QAing \nthe slides only (not the speaker notes\n, they will not translate those) and the \nvideos would need subtitles only\n. \n\u00a0\nAnd how much do we typically pay reviewers to do this?\n\u00a0\nGracias!\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\nRebecca M.

The URLs have changed across all languages, and they would like the updated URLs placed and have SCORM files re-generated.\n\u00a0\nMay I request the associated cost and timing of this request please? I\u2019m crossing my fingers it won\u2019t be too onerous, but do let me know the expected cost, with a rush order applied if possible.\n\u00a0\nThanks in advance,\n\u00a0\nDon\n\u00a0\n_________________________\nDiligent\nDon Reyes,\n he/him\nDirector, Advisory and Consulting Services \nSuite 1500, 980 Howe Street, Vancouver, BC, Canada, V6Z 0C8\nOffice Line: 202-227-2155|\u00a0\ndreyes@diligent.com\n |\u00a0\ndiligent.com\n\u00a0\nDisclaimer\nThe information contained in this communication from the sender is confidential.

Wanted to submit a WO request for some URL updates on a CoC course!\n\u00a0\nI attached the workorder request above and uploaded it in the Jeld Wen folder in our fileshare (\nhttps://securefiles.diligentboards.com/web/room/drid:5a13e4a6-dd40-43d9-8dff-a0e9c0805fe3/content\n):\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\nTo summarize the request: There is a slide in the course across all languages (I believe it was slide 5) that has a URL pointing them to a document/site. The URLs have changed across all languages, and they would like the updated URLs placed and have SCORM files re-generated.\n\u00a0\nMay I request the associated cost and timing of this request please? I\u2019m crossing my fingers it won\u2019t be too onerous, but do let me know the expected cost, with a rush order applied if possible.\n\u00a0\nThanks in advance,\n\u00a0\nDon\n\u00a0\n_________________________\nDiligent\nDon Reyes,\n\u00a0he/him\nDirector, Advisory and Consulting Services\nSuite 1500, 980 Howe Street, Vancouver, BC, Canada, V6Z 0C8\nOffice Line: 202-227-2155| \ndreyes@diligent.com\n\u00a0| \ndiligent.com",
