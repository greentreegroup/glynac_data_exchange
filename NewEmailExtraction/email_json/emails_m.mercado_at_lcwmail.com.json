Understand that culture is what \"fills the space,\" and you'll start to see how to actually create it.\n\ud83c\udf31\n Culture is how people treat each other when no one's looking.\n\ud83c\udf31\n Culture is how you respond to a crisis.\n\ud83c\udf31\n Culture is how you celebrate, but also how you grieve, mourn, learn, and process.\n\ud83c\udf31\n Culture is what you value and prioritize.\n\ud83c\udf31\n Culture is your shared identity and guiding compass.\nWe can build and shape the workplace cultures around us, but it doesn't happen through event programming alone. Leaders, both those with formal leadership titles and those without, create culture. Incentives, structures, and processes, formal and informal, serve as culture's foundation. And yes\u2014events and important moments express it and maintain it.\nIt can be all to easy to \"start with events\" and go from there, like buying the decorations for your plane before you've built it. It's easy. It's flashy. But the toxicity you let breed while building this empty \"culture\" hurts everyone.

    "body": "Hi Maria,\nI would like to confirm (from a HR standpoint) the documentation we need to have on file for new vendors. Up until now, we have only required the following:\n1. LCW Agreement signed\n2. W9 (or W8 form signed for non-US).\n3. Contractor Profile Information + Payment preferences\n(Attached is a sample of the package)\nI'm inquiring because of your email requesting two additional forms of identification from our vendors. Thank you for guiding us through the new process and its requirements.\n\u00a0\nMaria Fagrelius\nDirector of Global Language Solutions\nLCW\n\u00a0\nWebsite\n\u00a0\n|\n\u00a0\nTwitter\n \n|\n\u00a0\nFacebook\n\u00a0\n|\n\u00a0\nLinkedIn\nView our upcoming events\n | \nSign-up for our newsletter\n\u00a0\nFrom:\n Maria Fagrelius \nSent:\n Tuesday, August 22, 2023 7:37 AM\nTo:\n Maria Mercado <m.mercado@lcwmail.com>\nSubject:\n FW: External contractor requirements\n\u00a0\nGood morning, Maria. I hope you're well. I wanted to bring up the emails you sent to our contractors yesterday. I've received some feedback, and it appears that there might be a few points we could improve upon for clarity.\nGiven that most of our contractors are located overseas, it would be helpful if you could provide more specific details about the types of identifications that are acceptable for the purpose mentioned in the emails. This will prevent any confusion and ensure a smoother process.\nIn the future, it could be beneficial to include me in these communications. This will not only keep me informed but also address any concerns from translators who might be questioning the legitimacy of the emails. As you know, requesting identification forms through email is a common tactic used by spammers, so adding an official company signature (LCW signature) could lend credibility and trustworthiness to our communications.\nIf you have any questions or need further assistance, feel free to reach out.

However, I must admit that I have some concerns about the recent email I received requesting additional forms of identification.\nGiven the sensitive nature of personal information, I believe it's essential to exercise caution when sharing such details. As you can understand, providing personal identification documents to an unfamiliar source raises security and privacy concerns.\nTo ensure that we handle this matter appropriately, I kindly request that you provide me with more information about your organisation and the specific compliance measures you are conducting. It would be helpful to verify this request's legitimacy and establish a level of trust between us.\nIf you could please share some details about your company, the audit process, and any official channels through which I can confirm your identity, I would be more than willing to cooperate in a way that aligns with the best practices for safeguarding personal information.\nThank you for your understanding.
