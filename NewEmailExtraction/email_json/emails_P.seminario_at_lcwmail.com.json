I figured I'd email just you for now on this Larry mess \ud83d\ude42. According to Andrea, Larry is not due any money for the Aflac sessions. She is correct, considering the language in the PA states he gets nothing for cancelations. That said, we would owe\u00a0him \u00a0$475\u00a0for Aflac IF we had the old cancelation & postponement policy in the PAs. And we would owe Larry $1,400 for Group M\u00a0 IF we had the old cancelation & postponement policy in the PAs. Grand total of $1,875.\u00a0 I'm still unclear as to what, if anything, we are charging Aflac....but that's kind of besides the point. The facts are that Larry signed a PA (I believe multiple times) that had different terms. It would have been nice if he was alerted to those terms, but I don't think he was. And, his argument is that the new can/post policy (within 2 days & within 5 days) should not apply here. But that logic is flawed, because this new policy wasn't even in the PAs sent to him. It was brand new language that RP put in. She hasn't answered why - or maybe I missed that. Maybe she edited it because of Group M's unique canc/post policy....? Anyway, I know this is a headache, but here is what I'm thinking.... We pay him half of the total above - $937.50. We acknowledge the miscommunication - he should have been notified of this new language in the PA (was he??) We offer a gesture of goodwill & offer to pay 50% of what he would have received under the old policy What do you think? I will work on this process to make it easier going forward. Thank you!

I figured I'd email just you for now on this Larry mess \ud83d\ude42. \nAccording to Andrea, Larry is not due any money for the Aflac sessions. She is correct, considering the language in the PA states he gets nothing for cancelations. \nThat said, we would owe\u00a0him \n\u00a0$475\n\u00a0for \nAflac\n \nIF \nwe had the old cancelation & postponement policy in the PAs. \nAnd we would owe Larry \n$1,400 \nfor \nGroup M\n\u00a0 \nIF \nwe had the old cancelation & postponement policy in the PAs. \nGrand total of $1,875.\n\u00a0 \nI'm still unclear as to what, if anything, we are charging Aflac....but that's kind of besides the point. \nThe facts are that Larry signed a PA (I believe multiple times) that had different terms. It would have been nice if he was alerted to those terms, but I don't think he was. And, his argument is that the new can/post policy (within 2 days & within 5 days) should not apply here. But that logic is flawed, because this new policy wasn't even in the PAs sent to him. It was brand new language that RP put in. She hasn't answered why - or maybe I missed that. Maybe she edited it because of Group M's unique canc/post policy....? \nAnyway, I know this is a headache, but here is what I'm thinking.... \nWe pay him half of the total above - $937.50.\n \nWe acknowledge the miscommunication - he should have been notified of this new language in the PA \n(was he??)\n \nWe offer a gesture of goodwill & offer to pay 50% of what he would have received under the old policy \nWhat do you think? \nI will work on this process to make it easier going forward. \nThank you! \n\u00a0\nCONTACT \nChuck Adams\nc.adams@lcwmail.com\n000.555.1212\n\u00a0\nCONTACT \nNicole Barile\nn.barile@lcwmail.com\n\u00a0\nView in HubSpot\n\u00a0\nThis email was sent to \np.seminario@lcwmail.com\n because the notification \nActivity on record you own or follow\n is turned on in the account \nlcwinclusion.com\n (Hub ID: 23618458) \n\u00a0\n\u00a0\nDo you want to stop receiving these emails?\n \u00a0\nTurn off\n \nActivity on record you own or follow\n email notifications. \u00a0\n\u00a0\nHubSpot, Inc.\n2 Canal Park\nCambridge, MA 02141",

In case of cancellation, the Contractor will invoice LCW for the pro-rated amount due (based on working days, not calendar days), up to and including the last day of full-time work.\u201d \n\u00a0 \nFinally, we have invoiced and received 50% of the SOW fee.\u00a0 AND we invoiced the Neurodiversity session that was delivered, and 100% of the PM fee.\u00a0 They want to know if we are billing forward, or taking \u201cfrom the prepayment pot\u201d.\u00a0 I need to meet with Chuck and SG \u00a0to answer this question before Thursday COB.\u00a0 The complexity of this situation suggests a a live discussion.\u00a0 Thinking about current and future implications goes beyond what we pay LB. \n\u00a0 \nCheers~ \n\u00a0 \nAndrea Wicks Bowles \n(She/Her/Hers) \nSenior Consultant \nLCW \nWebsite\n\u00a0\n|\n\u00a0\nTwitter\n \n|\n\u00a0\nFacebook\n\u00a0\n|\n\u00a0\nLinkedIn\n \nView our upcoming events\n \n| \nSign-up for our newsletter\n \n\u00a0 \n\u00a0\nCONTACT \nRebecca Parrilla\nr.parrilla@lcwmail.com\n+1.773.938.3784\n\u00a0\nCONTACT \nNicole Barile\nn.barile@lcwmail.com\n\u00a0\nCONTACT \nAndrea Bowles\na.wicksbowles@lcwmail.com\n773-938-4181\n\u00a0\nView in HubSpot\n\u00a0\nThis email was sent to \np.seminario@lcwmail.com\n because the notification \nActivity on record you own or follow\n is turned on in the account \nlcwinclusion.com\n (Hub ID: 23618458) \n\u00a0\n\u00a0\nDo you want to stop receiving these emails?\n \u00a0\nTurn off\n \nActivity on record you own or follow\n email notifications. \u00a0\n\u00a0\nHubSpot, Inc.\n2 Canal Park\nCambridge, MA 02141",

This was a confusing one \ud83d\ude42.

(Btw he emailed me that he wasn\u2019t able to do April 28 after all so that date should be crossed off the list on the SOW and it\u2019s actually a total of 16 GroupM sessions, not 18).I\u2019m not sure there would have been a ton of prep for Larry for these sessions because he\u2019s facilitated this content many times in advance, however, he did reserve the dates so in my opinion some courtesy compensation is warranted for the opportunity cost. \u00a0We had contracted to pay him $350 per GroupM session so that would be a total of $840 for 16 sessions. \u00a0 Here\u2019s the timeline of GroupM events in case helpful: 2/10/25: Emailed Larry first Project Assignment: \nhttps://www.dropbox.com/scl/fi/cgc6hgzlh1tmho1gtkmxv/PA-25-01_Baker_Feb-Apri2025-Facilitationsv1.pdf?rlkey=8hi9thqdm0xykzgl1kzk1tl4c&dl=0\n\u00a0with start date of February 24th \u00a0(14 dates / 28\u00a0 GroupM sessions total) 2/13: Lukeisha notified us that they are not ready to start on February 24th\u00a0and it would \u201cprobably be the first or second week in March\u201d. Notified Larry the same day via email 2/18: We had an internal meeting with GroupM. Lukeisha said the earliest first session would be March 14th\u00a0earliest. Notified Larry via email. Sent Larry a revised PA: \nhttps://www.dropbox.com/scl/fi/p4gr7gpj018ykklgwfyo0/PA-20-01_Baker_Mar-Apr2025-Facilitationsv2.pdf?rlkey=atrogqbj39bgbbfletvr0b1zj&dl=0\n\u00a0with the first session being March 14th 2/19: Received signed PA back from Larry 2/21: Larry asked me about a Spencer Stewart session. I asked Chuck about it, He confirmed that this should be added to the PA so I sent Larry a new PA: \nhttps://www.dropbox.com/scl/fi/1lop63gfad8g7fui01bzq/PA-25-01_Baker_Mar-Apr2025-Facilitationsv3.pdf?rlkey=iviqj5abkc1doxksjt4id7cx0&dl=0\n\u00a0which included the Spencer Stewart session on 3/6. The first GroupM session was still listed as 3/14. 3/5: GroupM pushed back first session again and I notified Larry via email. GroupM saying the earliest would be March 21st 3/17: GroupM pushed back the 2025 launch again, this time to \u201clate April at the earliest\u201d, I notified Larry 3/25: We still don\u2019t have a firm start date. GroupM has checked off all but one task they needed to do before we can firm up that date. We have a meeting with them tomorrow (3/16) where hopefully this last task will be resolved (it has to do with their scheduling system). \u00a0 RP \u00a0 Rebecca M.

Jaya and I have been exploring what these LCW sessions could look like for our ERG Leadership team and have a couple question regarding our global colleagues: \n\u00a0 \nWe currently have three executive sponsors based in EMEA and one in APAC. We can likely schedule sessions at a fairly reasonable time for our Americas and EMEA colleagues, but unfortunately not APAC. We obviously do not want our APAC colleague to feel excluded, so I am curious to know how you generally handle a timing issue like this? \nAlong the same vein, we have several APAC and EMEA colleagues who serve in leadership of the ERGs (as co-leads, not Executive Sponsors), so we run into the scheduling issue again. We do want to be able to accommodate all time zones, so I presume we would need a separate session for our EMEA/APAC colleagues. Would there be an additional cost associated with this, and, if so, what would the costs be? We want to be cost conscious but are mindful of these time zone issues and want to be fair to your team, as well. \n\u00a0 \nThanks in advance! \n\u00a0 \nBest, \nLiz \n\u00a0 \nElizabeth \u201cLiz\u201d Bushner\n\u00a0\n(she/her/hers)\nSpencer Stuart\n\u00a0San Francisco\n \nT\u00a0415.808.8905 \nTaking pride in diversity and inclusion\n \n\u00a0 \nThis message is a private communication.

Sorry for sending yet another email, but wanted to let you know that after reading \nthe actual EEOC document\n, it seems to me that Paradigm\u2019s last row below can be confusing or even misleading. Regarding training, the EEOC guidelines state: \n\u00a0 \nTitle VII also\u00a0prohibits employers from limiting, segregating, or classifying employees or applicants based on race, sex, or other protected characteristics in a way that affects their status or deprives them of employment opportunities...\n[28]\n\u00a0 \n\u00a0 \nUnlawful limiting, segregating, or classifying workers related to DEI can arise when employers separate workers into groups based on race, sex, or another protected characteristic when administering DEI or any trainings, workplace programming, or other privileges of employment, even if the separate groups receive the same programming content or amount of employer resources.\n[31]\n\u2026 \n\u00a0 \nEmployers instead should provide \u201ctraining and mentoring that provides workers\u00a0\nof all backgrounds\n\u00a0the opportunity, skill, experience, and information necessary to perform well, and to ascend\u00a0to upper-level jobs.\u201d\n[32]\n\u00a0 \n\u00a0 \nSo I interpret the above as separating workers in terms of who participates or is given the oppty to attend the training, not the \ncontent\n of the training. \n\u00a0 \nJust wanted to clarify that.

I've had some time to go through the menu and have a few questions about pricing for each course. I'm interested in the following sessions,\u00a0divided by type. Are they priced by the hour, by the session or both? It's a little of both and the number of faciltators.\u00a0Let's assume we have 40 people in each session, would we need 3 or 4 sessions of each? We usually suggest that sessions be limited to 25-30 people in order to maximize interaction and engagement. We find that active participation suffers as the number of participants increases. We are flexible, though.\u00a0 Facilitated learning Cultural Competence & Inclusion Skill-Building: Building a Culture of Inclusion (all audiences)\u00a0 Pricing is $8,000 per session.\u00a0 Inclusion\u00a0Skill-Building: Brave Conversations on Race\u00a0+ Power of Allyship Culture (all audiences) Pricing is $8,000 per session for each .\u00a0 Cultural Competence & Inclusion Skill-Building: Building a Culture of Inclusion Pricing is $12,000 \u00a0per session\u00a0+ Leading with Conscious Inclusion (managers & leaders)\u00a0 Pricing is $8,000 per session ELearning -\u00a0We have two models for elearning; 1) a price based on org size which starts at $20k for up to 10,000 users, and 2) for smaller organizations we host the modules for $50 for each user (for 12 months). The latter would work best for you folks. Foundations of Diversity & Inclusion (all audiences) Fostering Collaboration (all audiences) Mini-workshops Foundations\u00a0of Diversity & Inclusion\u00a0Price is $3,600\u00a0per session Spotlight on Intersectionality Price is $3,600\u00a0per session I realize I am repeating myself with the foundations courses, but I think it's important to offer this in different\u00a0ways so the message clicks for everyone, and also because I don't know that everyone will attend each kind of session. Can you tell me what the cost of those selections would be, based on a company of 160 people? We have 50-60 people who are people managers and would be in the manager & leader sessions. Thank you!

Don\u2019t be put off by the final cost in the proposal. \ud83d\ude0a\u00a0\u00a0To build the proposal I had to assume some things around the final number of sessions and the specific manager/leader training you might be interested in. Note that any of the products in the deck can be swapped out for assumptions made in the proposal. \u00a0 Either way, think of this as a menu that we can customize accordingly. \u00a0 You\u2019ll notice that I did not provide pricing on the Diversity Leadership Governance piece yet. I need to talk with the team about how best to represent that outside of the ERG/BRG Consulting Package. As I was reviewing the program I noticed that there wasn\u2019t a clean line item for that piece alone. I will work to get you that tomorrow. \u00a0 Please let me know if you want to meet and discuss anything sent here. We can schedule a follow up call for end of this week/early next week at your convenience. \u00a0 Best, \u00a0 Chuck \u00a0 Chuck Adams (He/Him) Chief Executive Officer LCW Office: +1.773.938.4285 Mobile: +1.630.373.5068 \u00a0 \u00a0 Website: \nhttps://nam10.safelinks.protection.outlook.com/?url=https%3A%2F%2Furl.us.m.mimecastprotect.com%2Fs%2FQZJxC68lwAIrKlnSpfLU5DQ7o%3Fdomain%3Dinfo.lcwinclusion.com&data=05%7C02%7Cc.adams%40lcwmail.com%7Cc9b123cf44b848653bf608dd67fcfeac%7C3ca40a42d72d43c9b92e0740101d9dd3%7C0%7C0%7C638781058542783177%7CUnknown%7CTWFpbGZsb3d8eyJFbXB0eU1hcGkiOnRydWUsIlYiOiIwLjAuMDAwMCIsIlAiOiJXaW4zMiIsIkFOIjoiTWFpbCIsIldUIjoyfQ%3D%3D%7C0%7C%7C%7C&sdata=RiYYa6d6rHn03NeLRXggVp1bF7HgByydaRDZzkrYIFg%3D&reserved=0\n\u00a0|\u00a0Twitter: \nhttps://nam10.safelinks.protection.outlook.com/?url=https%3A%2F%2Furl.us.m.mimecastprotect.com%2Fs%2Fsz7tC73mxBuAkjOCWhWUoRL0R%3Fdomain%3Dinfo.lcwinclusion.com&data=05%7C02%7Cc.adams%40lcwmail.com%7Cc9b123cf44b848653bf608dd67fcfeac%7C3ca40a42d72d43c9b92e0740101d9dd3%7C0%7C0%7C638781058542808227%7CUnknown%7CTWFpbGZsb3d8eyJFbXB0eU1hcGkiOnRydWUsIlYiOiIwLjAuMDAwMCIsIlAiOiJXaW4zMiIsIkFOIjoiTWFpbCIsIldUIjoyfQ%3D%3D%7C0%7C%7C%7C&sdata=ZC6RVIF7ccmu3b5Cm4QiV6ZPvI3u%2Fj4PQJaZ7tCNedk%3D&reserved=0\n |\u00a0Facebook: \nhttps://nam10.safelinks.protection.outlook.com/?url=https%3A%2F%2Furl.us.m.mimecastprotect.com%2Fs%2Fi3FPC82nyDI6R87I2iXUyIGQz%3Fdomain%3Dinfo.lcwinclusion.com&data=05%7C02%7Cc.adams%40lcwmail.com%7Cc9b123cf44b848653bf608dd67fcfeac%7C3ca40a42d72d43c9b92e0740101d9dd3%7C0%7C0%7C638781058542822670%7CUnknown%7CTWFpbGZsb3d8eyJFbXB0eU1hcGkiOnRydWUsIlYiOiIwLjAuMDAwMCIsIlAiOiJXaW4zMiIsIkFOIjoiTWFpbCIsIldUIjoyfQ%3D%3D%7C0%7C%7C%7C&sdata=%2B14Dk1YzAr3IlxMC15C3RKnNaEEXqUgTDgfO3BALt6c%3D&reserved=0\n\u00a0|\u00a0LinkedIn: \nhttps://nam10.safelinks.protection.outlook.com/?url=https%3A%2F%2Furl.us.m.mimecastprotect.com%2Fs%2FBNcZC9rozEckBV5SOsOUq1zvT%3Fdomain%3Dinfo.lcwinclusion.com&data=05%7C02%7Cc.adams%40lcwmail.com%7Cc9b123cf44b848653bf608dd67fcfeac%7C3ca40a42d72d43c9b92e0740101d9dd3%7C0%7C0%7C638781058542838096%7CUnknown%7CTWFpbGZsb3d8eyJFbXB0eU1hcGkiOnRydWUsIlYiOiIwLjAuMDAwMCIsIlAiOiJXaW4zMiIsIkFOIjoiTWFpbCIsIldUIjoyfQ%3D%3D%7C0%7C%7C%7C&sdata=bO%2B%2F95piXK67ZtosNOo2Zfjpm%2B6Wj%2BBEe2QTFOWo718%3D&reserved=0\n View our upcoming events: \nhttps://nam10.safelinks.protection.outlook.com/?url=https%3A%2F%2Furl.us.m.mimecastprotect.com%2Fs%2FGKolC0RNnrhG30RiOtgU9WM7X%3Fdomain%3Dinfo.lcwinclusion.com&data=05%7C02%7Cc.adams%40lcwmail.com%7Cc9b123cf44b848653bf608dd67fcfeac%7C3ca40a42d72d43c9b92e0740101d9dd3%7C0%7C0%7C638781058542851359%7CUnknown%7CTWFpbGZsb3d8eyJFbXB0eU1hcGkiOnRydWUsIlYiOiIwLjAuMDAwMCIsIlAiOiJXaW4zMiIsIkFOIjoiTWFpbCIsIldUIjoyfQ%3D%3D%7C0%7C%7C%7C&sdata=%2FiGrqK3X4Hfu1MXsCh1RxWWqTZGkmvGh1RcuNM7Q5P0%3D&reserved=0\n\u00a0| Sign-up for our newsletter: \nhttps://nam10.safelinks.protection.outlook.com/?url=https%3A%2F%2Furl.us.m.mimecastprotect.com%2Fs%2FdsBoCgJOq9FA25LC7uWU4YGNo%3Fdomain%3Dinfo.lcwinclusion.com&data=05%7C02%7Cc.adams%40lcwmail.com%7Cc9b123cf44b848653bf608dd67fcfeac%7C3ca40a42d72d43c9b92e0740101d9dd3%7C0%7C0%7C638781058542863697%7CUnknown%7CTWFpbGZsb3d8eyJFbXB0eU1hcGkiOnRydWUsIlYiOiIwLjAuMDAwMCIsIlAiOiJXaW4zMiIsIkFOIjoiTWFpbCIsIldUIjoyfQ%3D%3D%7C0%7C%7C%7C&sdata=J83SuVBh7PWWoxL7zguav7kwQqT246ClQ1JhHApirRI%3D&reserved=0\n \u00a0 Disclaimer The information contained in this communication from the sender is confidential.

I wrote that quote for GroupM, a media planning organization. So maybe replace with: \n\u00a0 \n\u201cIf we make business decisions based on outdated assumptions, we risk missing opportunities and alienating potential customers. When we understand and work to meet the needs of a diverse marketplace, we\u2019ll have stronger customer engagement and better business outcomes.\" \n\u00a0 \nI also wrote the second quote under item #2 for GroupM. So I\u2019d edit that one to: \n\u201cIf our company wants to be the best in the marketplace, we must understand\n...\u201d \n\u00a0 \nI agree with Chuck\u2019s suggestion for the example for item #3. I\u2019d recommend using \u2018employee\u2019 (or even \u2018manager\u2019) instead of \u2018worker.\u2019 \u00a0 \n\u00a0 \nRe: item #4 and Chuck\u2019s suggestion, I might add a third line as opposed to replacing one of the answers that are already there. I would also slightly edit the language to: \u00a0\n\u201cQuotas have been illegal for some time. Often people confuse quotas with earnest attempts to include a broader pool of qualified candidates so we can have a better chance of selecting the best people for our open roles.\u201d\n \n\u00a0 \nRe: item #5, an example statement could be \n\u201cI don\u2019t know why people make such a big deal about inclusion. People just need to have thicker skin\u201d.\n The quote intentionally brings up where you grew up because it\u2019s meant to generate empathy and understanding from a privileged (non-underrepresented) person. \n\u00a0 \nRe: item #6, I like Chuck\u2019s suggestion and would slightly edit it thusly: \n\u201cWhy should we devote time and money to inclusion? We\u2019re a profit-seeking company.\u201d \n\u00a0 \nRe: Chuck\u2019s suggestion about a statement that ties DEI to company values, we could add a second line under item #5 (\u201cAppeal to Fairness & Ethics\u201d) that touches on this. For example: \n\u201cIf we want to live out our corporate values of excellence, innovation, and customer commitment, we must create an environment where every employee can contribute their best work. \u00a0When we foster an inclusive culture where everyone is engaged and able to contribute fully, we unlock the full potential of our people\u2014our most valuable asset.\"\n \n\u00a0 \nIf you provide me with the PPT, I can make all these changes myself and then resend to Keri.\n \n\u00a0 \nRebecca M.

I've had some time to go through the menu and have a few questions about pricing for each course. \nI'm interested in the following sessions,\u00a0divided by type. Are they priced by the hour, by the session or both? \nIt's a little of both and the number of faciltators.\n\u00a0Let's assume we have 40 people in each session, would we need 3 or 4 sessions of each? \nWe usually suggest that sessions be limited to 25-30 people in order to maximize interaction and engagement. We find that active participation suffers as the number of participants increases. We are flexible, though.\u00a0\n \nFacilitated learning\nCultural Competence & Inclusion Skill-Building: Building a Culture of Inclusion (all audiences)\u00a0 \nPricing is $8,000 per session.\u00a0\n \nInclusion\u00a0Skill-Building: Brave Conversations on Race\u00a0+ Power of Allyship Culture (all audiences) \nPricing is $8,000 \nper session for each\n \n.\u00a0\n \nCultural Competence & Inclusion Skill-Building: Building a Culture of Inclusion \nPricing is $12,000\n \n\u00a0per session\n\u00a0+ Leading with Conscious Inclusion (managers & leaders)\u00a0 \nPricing is $8,000 \nper session\n \nELearning -\n\u00a0We have two models for elearning; 1) a price based on org size which starts at $20k for up to 10,000 users, and 2) for smaller organizations we host the modules for $50 for each user (for 12 months). The latter would work best for you folks.\nFoundations of Diversity & Inclusion (all audiences)\nFostering Collaboration (all audiences)\nMini-workshops\nFoundations\u00a0of Diversity & Inclusion\n\u00a0Price is $3,600\n\u00a0per session\nSpotlight on Intersectionality \nPrice is $3,600\u00a0per session\nI realize I am repeating myself with the foundations courses, but I think it's important to offer this in different\u00a0ways so the message clicks for everyone, and also because I don't know that everyone will attend each kind of session. \nCan you tell me what the cost of those selections would be, based on a company of 160 people? We have 50-60 people who are people managers and would be in the manager & leader sessions. \nThank you! \nOn Mon, Mar 10, 2025 at 2:05 PM Chuck Adams < \nc.adams@lcwmail.com\n> wrote: \nHi, Rocio \u2013\n\u00a0\nAttached are the information deck and \u00a0proposal with pricing we discussed. Don\u2019t be put off by the final cost in the proposal. \n\ud83d\ude0a\n\u00a0\u00a0To build the proposal I had to assume some things around the final number of sessions and the specific manager/leader training you might be interested in. Note that any of the products in the deck can be swapped out for assumptions made in the proposal.\n\u00a0\nEither way, think of this as a menu that we can customize accordingly.\n\u00a0\nYou\u2019ll notice that I did not provide pricing on the Diversity Leadership Governance piece yet. I need to talk with the team about how best to represent that outside of the ERG/BRG Consulting Package. As I was reviewing the program I noticed that there wasn\u2019t a clean line item for that piece alone.

While honing your message accurately IS a result of having diverse folks in the decision making process, I think we could mention the higher probability of developing new products and services that appeal to groups outside of a company\u2019s traditional market. \n\u00a0 \nQuestion 3 needs an example statement. \nHow about something like, \u201cI don\u2019t see why we need to spend extra money searching for \nnew\n talent. We've been successful hiring a certain type of worker throughout our history.\u201d \n\u00a0 \nThe examples in Question 4 indirectly respond to the statement. \nA better response might be, \u201cHiring quotas have been illegal for some time. What some confuse with quotas are better described as earnest attempts to ensure that underrepresented workers, however that\u2019s defined in your workplace, aren\u2019t underrepresented because of harmful policies and practices.\u201d \n\u00a0 \nQuestion 5 needs an example statement. \nNot sure that the response resonates as much as it could. Being ignored because of where you grew up seems safe. How might other people know where you grew up? Also, and this is just me, but the only thing divisive about the \u2018identity politics\u2019 is that it offends people who don\u2019t have to consider their identity day to day. \n\u00a0 \nQuestion 6 needs an example statement. \nSomething like, \u201cWhy is any of this important? We\u2019re a company, not a social nonprofit.\u201d \n\u00a0 \nApologies if this is late in the game. If we are going to have the EXAMPLE rows present we need to fill them or remove them. There also isn\u2019t an option statement that ties DEI work to company values, which is what I hear from the companies still committed to this work. For some companies this is still a values play. \n\u00a0 \nChuck Adams\n \n(He/Him)\n \nChief Executive Officer \nLCW \nOffice: \n+1.773.938.4285\n \nMobile: +1.630.373.5068 \n\u00a0 \nWebsite\n\u00a0\n|\n\u00a0\nTwitter\n \n|\n\u00a0\nFacebook\n\u00a0\n|\n\u00a0\nLinkedIn\n \nView our upcoming events\n \n| \nSign-up for our newsletter\n \n\u00a0 \n\u00a0 \n\u00a0\nCOMPANY \nLcwmail\n7737555869\n\u00a0\nCONTACT \nRebecca Parrilla\nr.parrilla@lcwmail.com\n+1.773.938.3784\n\u00a0\nCONTACT \nNicole Barile\nn.barile@lcwmail.com\n\u00a0\nCONTACT \nAndrea Bowles\na.wicksbowles@lcwmail.com\n773-938-4181\n\u00a0\nView in HubSpot\n\u00a0\nThis message was sent to \np.seminario@lcwmail.com\n because your preferences are set to receive notifications like this. \n\u00a0\n\u00a0\nTurn off\n \"Activity on record you own or follow\" email notifications. \u00a0\n\u00a0\nlcwinclusion.com\n (Hub ID: 23618458) \nHubSpot, Inc.\n2 Canal Park\nCambridge, MA 02141",

DEI annual required education, which is online \u201cbite-sized\u201d modules, that cover topics including (In total ~25 min of content): Inclusive Language and Belonging Identifying Microaggressions and Stereotypes Upstander Interventions Expanding your Network How to Intervene with Skill Facing Criticism Microaggressions & Allyship:\u00a0 90-minute course in which you will learn about micro-aggressions in the workplace and three roles one can have in relation to them: actor, target, and observer. Through the lens of allyship, we will review real clinical examples and explore strategies to intervene and manage after a microaggression. Individual Connection to Bias and Privilege for Leaders:\u00a0 120-minute course designed for people leaders including managers, supervisors, directors and above, understanding how each of us are impacted by bias and privilege are key components to the personal development we are all called to do if we want to deliver on our ICARE values equitably. Exploring these concepts and how they apply to our leadership skills is a critical first step to leading inclusively. Join this introduction to these concepts to begin your self-reflection journey in DEI as a leader and gain insights into building DEI into your team. Leveraging Privilege for Breakthroughs:\u00a0 (this has not yet been confirmed to be part of the learning journey):\u00a0 120-minute course that enables the learner to take a deeper dive into a self-reflective and action-oriented exploration of how we, as leaders, must push through discomfort to create meaningful change within our spheres of influence. Participants in this course will be challenged to identify the behaviors required to truly fulfill the concept of leveraging one\u2019s privilege and ways to foster conversation with their teams.

It was a pleasure speaking with you yesterday.\u00a0 Chuck and I look forward to our next conversations. Attached is a document that had been shared with Gilbert.\u00a0 I wanted to draw your attention to the following: IDI Information and description of the process (3 slides). Building a Culture of Inclusion (for Managers and Leaders) (2 slides). Managing Bias for Managers and Leaders (2 slides). This information will give you a better understanding of what we discussed.\u00a0 Of course, further clarity is needed, but I thought you might find this material interesting. Have a lovely weekend.

the Evolving DEI Landscape \u00a0 Hello friends! \u00a0 I would like to schedule our April LCW webinar around Navigating the Evolving DEI Landscape.\u00a0 \u00a0 My thought is that it could be a panel-type discussion with 2 or 3 of us, plus a guest. \u00a0 The guest I'm thinking about is Howard Ross (of Cook Ross).\u00a0 \u00a0 And I'm thinking 2 of you might be on it as well (Chuck for sure since you've been having client convos) to 1) share what we're hearing from our clients - how they're adapting to the current climate & 2) offer practical tips for organizations on managing change, facilitating inclusion conversations, etc. I could be a guest as well. \u00a0 The actual content can be decided on later, but this is the high-level idea. \u00a0 My thought is to do this after Passover/Easter, so maybe on April 22nd or 23rd around 12pm noon CST. \u00a0 Please let me know by Wed morning 3/19\u00a0if you would be interested and available...and if so, which date works for you. Would could also adjust the time if needed. \u00a0 Thank you!

You can, of course, decide not to go with the handbook at the end of the day. \n\u00a0 \nAlso, for your records, our Mini-Workshops/Spotlights start at $3,600 for a session, depending on facilitation model. We normally suggest that a session be limited to no more than 40 participants. Anything beyond that and the session becomes more lecture than training. Many clients will buy a couple of the session and hold them on different days/times to maximize attendance. \n\u00a0 \nPlease let us know if you have any questions. Otherwise, we will check back in with you in a couple of months. \n\u00a0 \nBest, \n\u00a0 \nChuck \n\u00a0 \nChuck Adams\n \n(He/Him)\n \nChief Executive Officer \nLCW \nOffice: \n+1.773.938.4285\n \nMobile: +1.630.373.5068 \n\u00a0 \n\u00a0 \nWebsite\n\u00a0\n|\n\u00a0\nTwitter\n \n|\n\u00a0\nFacebook\n\u00a0\n|\n\u00a0\nLinkedIn\n \nView our upcoming events\n \n| \nSign-up for our newsletter\n \n\u00a0 \nDisclaimer\nThe information contained in this communication from the sender is confidential.
