Sorry for sending yet another email, but wanted to let you know that after reading \nthe actual EEOC document\n, it seems to me that Paradigm\u2019s last row below can be confusing or even misleading. Regarding training, the EEOC guidelines state: \n\u00a0 \nTitle VII also\u00a0prohibits employers from limiting, segregating, or classifying employees or applicants based on race, sex, or other protected characteristics in a way that affects their status or deprives them of employment opportunities...\n[28]\n\u00a0 \n\u00a0 \nUnlawful limiting, segregating, or classifying workers related to DEI can arise when employers separate workers into groups based on race, sex, or another protected characteristic when administering DEI or any trainings, workplace programming, or other privileges of employment, even if the separate groups receive the same programming content or amount of employer resources.\n[31]\n\u2026 \n\u00a0 \nEmployers instead should provide \u201ctraining and mentoring that provides workers\u00a0\nof all backgrounds\n\u00a0the opportunity, skill, experience, and information necessary to perform well, and to ascend\u00a0to upper-level jobs.\u201d\n[32]\n\u00a0 \n\u00a0 \nSo I interpret the above as separating workers in terms of who participates or is given the oppty to attend the training, not the \ncontent\n of the training. \n\u00a0 \nJust wanted to clarify that.

I've had some time to go through the menu and have a few questions about pricing for each course. I'm interested in the following sessions,\u00a0divided by type. Are they priced by the hour, by the session or both? It's a little of both and the number of faciltators.\u00a0Let's assume we have 40 people in each session, would we need 3 or 4 sessions of each? We usually suggest that sessions be limited to 25-30 people in order to maximize interaction and engagement. We find that active participation suffers as the number of participants increases. We are flexible, though.\u00a0 Facilitated learning Cultural Competence & Inclusion Skill-Building: Building a Culture of Inclusion (all audiences)\u00a0 Pricing is $8,000 per session.\u00a0 Inclusion\u00a0Skill-Building: Brave Conversations on Race\u00a0+ Power of Allyship Culture (all audiences) Pricing is $8,000 per session for each .\u00a0 Cultural Competence & Inclusion Skill-Building: Building a Culture of Inclusion Pricing is $12,000 \u00a0per session\u00a0+ Leading with Conscious Inclusion (managers & leaders)\u00a0 Pricing is $8,000 per session ELearning -\u00a0We have two models for elearning; 1) a price based on org size which starts at $20k for up to 10,000 users, and 2) for smaller organizations we host the modules for $50 for each user (for 12 months). The latter would work best for you folks. Foundations of Diversity & Inclusion (all audiences) Fostering Collaboration (all audiences) Mini-workshops Foundations\u00a0of Diversity & Inclusion\u00a0Price is $3,600\u00a0per session Spotlight on Intersectionality Price is $3,600\u00a0per session I realize I am repeating myself with the foundations courses, but I think it's important to offer this in different\u00a0ways so the message clicks for everyone, and also because I don't know that everyone will attend each kind of session. Can you tell me what the cost of those selections would be, based on a company of 160 people? We have 50-60 people who are people managers and would be in the manager & leader sessions. Thank you!

Don\u2019t be put off by the final cost in the proposal. \ud83d\ude0a\u00a0\u00a0To build the proposal I had to assume some things around the final number of sessions and the specific manager/leader training you might be interested in. Note that any of the products in the deck can be swapped out for assumptions made in the proposal. \u00a0 Either way, think of this as a menu that we can customize accordingly. \u00a0 You\u2019ll notice that I did not provide pricing on the Diversity Leadership Governance piece yet. I need to talk with the team about how best to represent that outside of the ERG/BRG Consulting Package. As I was reviewing the program I noticed that there wasn\u2019t a clean line item for that piece alone. I will work to get you that tomorrow. \u00a0 Please let me know if you want to meet and discuss anything sent here. We can schedule a follow up call for end of this week/early next week at your convenience. \u00a0 Best, \u00a0 Chuck \u00a0 Chuck Adams (He/Him) Chief Executive Officer LCW Office: +1.773.938.4285 Mobile: +1.630.373.5068 \u00a0 \u00a0 Website: \nhttps://nam10.safelinks.protection.outlook.com/?url=https%3A%2F%2Furl.us.m.mimecastprotect.com%2Fs%2FQZJxC68lwAIrKlnSpfLU5DQ7o%3Fdomain%3Dinfo.lcwinclusion.com&data=05%7C02%7Cc.adams%40lcwmail.com%7Cc9b123cf44b848653bf608dd67fcfeac%7C3ca40a42d72d43c9b92e0740101d9dd3%7C0%7C0%7C638781058542783177%7CUnknown%7CTWFpbGZsb3d8eyJFbXB0eU1hcGkiOnRydWUsIlYiOiIwLjAuMDAwMCIsIlAiOiJXaW4zMiIsIkFOIjoiTWFpbCIsIldUIjoyfQ%3D%3D%7C0%7C%7C%7C&sdata=RiYYa6d6rHn03NeLRXggVp1bF7HgByydaRDZzkrYIFg%3D&reserved=0\n\u00a0|\u00a0Twitter: \nhttps://nam10.safelinks.protection.outlook.com/?url=https%3A%2F%2Furl.us.m.mimecastprotect.com%2Fs%2Fsz7tC73mxBuAkjOCWhWUoRL0R%3Fdomain%3Dinfo.lcwinclusion.com&data=05%7C02%7Cc.adams%40lcwmail.com%7Cc9b123cf44b848653bf608dd67fcfeac%7C3ca40a42d72d43c9b92e0740101d9dd3%7C0%7C0%7C638781058542808227%7CUnknown%7CTWFpbGZsb3d8eyJFbXB0eU1hcGkiOnRydWUsIlYiOiIwLjAuMDAwMCIsIlAiOiJXaW4zMiIsIkFOIjoiTWFpbCIsIldUIjoyfQ%3D%3D%7C0%7C%7C%7C&sdata=ZC6RVIF7ccmu3b5Cm4QiV6ZPvI3u%2Fj4PQJaZ7tCNedk%3D&reserved=0\n |\u00a0Facebook: \nhttps://nam10.safelinks.protection.outlook.com/?url=https%3A%2F%2Furl.us.m.mimecastprotect.com%2Fs%2Fi3FPC82nyDI6R87I2iXUyIGQz%3Fdomain%3Dinfo.lcwinclusion.com&data=05%7C02%7Cc.adams%40lcwmail.com%7Cc9b123cf44b848653bf608dd67fcfeac%7C3ca40a42d72d43c9b92e0740101d9dd3%7C0%7C0%7C638781058542822670%7CUnknown%7CTWFpbGZsb3d8eyJFbXB0eU1hcGkiOnRydWUsIlYiOiIwLjAuMDAwMCIsIlAiOiJXaW4zMiIsIkFOIjoiTWFpbCIsIldUIjoyfQ%3D%3D%7C0%7C%7C%7C&sdata=%2B14Dk1YzAr3IlxMC15C3RKnNaEEXqUgTDgfO3BALt6c%3D&reserved=0\n\u00a0|\u00a0LinkedIn: \nhttps://nam10.safelinks.protection.outlook.com/?url=https%3A%2F%2Furl.us.m.mimecastprotect.com%2Fs%2FBNcZC9rozEckBV5SOsOUq1zvT%3Fdomain%3Dinfo.lcwinclusion.com&data=05%7C02%7Cc.adams%40lcwmail.com%7Cc9b123cf44b848653bf608dd67fcfeac%7C3ca40a42d72d43c9b92e0740101d9dd3%7C0%7C0%7C638781058542838096%7CUnknown%7CTWFpbGZsb3d8eyJFbXB0eU1hcGkiOnRydWUsIlYiOiIwLjAuMDAwMCIsIlAiOiJXaW4zMiIsIkFOIjoiTWFpbCIsIldUIjoyfQ%3D%3D%7C0%7C%7C%7C&sdata=bO%2B%2F95piXK67ZtosNOo2Zfjpm%2B6Wj%2BBEe2QTFOWo718%3D&reserved=0\n View our upcoming events: \nhttps://nam10.safelinks.protection.outlook.com/?url=https%3A%2F%2Furl.us.m.mimecastprotect.com%2Fs%2FGKolC0RNnrhG30RiOtgU9WM7X%3Fdomain%3Dinfo.lcwinclusion.com&data=05%7C02%7Cc.adams%40lcwmail.com%7Cc9b123cf44b848653bf608dd67fcfeac%7C3ca40a42d72d43c9b92e0740101d9dd3%7C0%7C0%7C638781058542851359%7CUnknown%7CTWFpbGZsb3d8eyJFbXB0eU1hcGkiOnRydWUsIlYiOiIwLjAuMDAwMCIsIlAiOiJXaW4zMiIsIkFOIjoiTWFpbCIsIldUIjoyfQ%3D%3D%7C0%7C%7C%7C&sdata=%2FiGrqK3X4Hfu1MXsCh1RxWWqTZGkmvGh1RcuNM7Q5P0%3D&reserved=0\n\u00a0| Sign-up for our newsletter: \nhttps://nam10.safelinks.protection.outlook.com/?url=https%3A%2F%2Furl.us.m.mimecastprotect.com%2Fs%2FdsBoCgJOq9FA25LC7uWU4YGNo%3Fdomain%3Dinfo.lcwinclusion.com&data=05%7C02%7Cc.adams%40lcwmail.com%7Cc9b123cf44b848653bf608dd67fcfeac%7C3ca40a42d72d43c9b92e0740101d9dd3%7C0%7C0%7C638781058542863697%7CUnknown%7CTWFpbGZsb3d8eyJFbXB0eU1hcGkiOnRydWUsIlYiOiIwLjAuMDAwMCIsIlAiOiJXaW4zMiIsIkFOIjoiTWFpbCIsIldUIjoyfQ%3D%3D%7C0%7C%7C%7C&sdata=J83SuVBh7PWWoxL7zguav7kwQqT246ClQ1JhHApirRI%3D&reserved=0\n \u00a0 Disclaimer The information contained in this communication from the sender is confidential.

I wrote that quote for GroupM, a media planning organization. So maybe replace with: \n\u00a0 \n\u201cIf we make business decisions based on outdated assumptions, we risk missing opportunities and alienating potential customers. When we understand and work to meet the needs of a diverse marketplace, we\u2019ll have stronger customer engagement and better business outcomes.\" \n\u00a0 \nI also wrote the second quote under item #2 for GroupM. So I\u2019d edit that one to: \n\u201cIf our company wants to be the best in the marketplace, we must understand\n...\u201d \n\u00a0 \nI agree with Chuck\u2019s suggestion for the example for item #3. I\u2019d recommend using \u2018employee\u2019 (or even \u2018manager\u2019) instead of \u2018worker.\u2019 \u00a0 \n\u00a0 \nRe: item #4 and Chuck\u2019s suggestion, I might add a third line as opposed to replacing one of the answers that are already there. I would also slightly edit the language to: \u00a0\n\u201cQuotas have been illegal for some time. Often people confuse quotas with earnest attempts to include a broader pool of qualified candidates so we can have a better chance of selecting the best people for our open roles.\u201d\n \n\u00a0 \nRe: item #5, an example statement could be \n\u201cI don\u2019t know why people make such a big deal about inclusion. People just need to have thicker skin\u201d.\n The quote intentionally brings up where you grew up because it\u2019s meant to generate empathy and understanding from a privileged (non-underrepresented) person. \n\u00a0 \nRe: item #6, I like Chuck\u2019s suggestion and would slightly edit it thusly: \n\u201cWhy should we devote time and money to inclusion? We\u2019re a profit-seeking company.\u201d \n\u00a0 \nRe: Chuck\u2019s suggestion about a statement that ties DEI to company values, we could add a second line under item #5 (\u201cAppeal to Fairness & Ethics\u201d) that touches on this. For example: \n\u201cIf we want to live out our corporate values of excellence, innovation, and customer commitment, we must create an environment where every employee can contribute their best work. \u00a0When we foster an inclusive culture where everyone is engaged and able to contribute fully, we unlock the full potential of our people\u2014our most valuable asset.\"\n \n\u00a0 \nIf you provide me with the PPT, I can make all these changes myself and then resend to Keri.\n \n\u00a0 \nRebecca M.

I've had some time to go through the menu and have a few questions about pricing for each course. \nI'm interested in the following sessions,\u00a0divided by type. Are they priced by the hour, by the session or both? \nIt's a little of both and the number of faciltators.\n\u00a0Let's assume we have 40 people in each session, would we need 3 or 4 sessions of each? \nWe usually suggest that sessions be limited to 25-30 people in order to maximize interaction and engagement. We find that active participation suffers as the number of participants increases. We are flexible, though.\u00a0\n \nFacilitated learning\nCultural Competence & Inclusion Skill-Building: Building a Culture of Inclusion (all audiences)\u00a0 \nPricing is $8,000 per session.\u00a0\n \nInclusion\u00a0Skill-Building: Brave Conversations on Race\u00a0+ Power of Allyship Culture (all audiences) \nPricing is $8,000 \nper session for each\n \n.\u00a0\n \nCultural Competence & Inclusion Skill-Building: Building a Culture of Inclusion \nPricing is $12,000\n \n\u00a0per session\n\u00a0+ Leading with Conscious Inclusion (managers & leaders)\u00a0 \nPricing is $8,000 \nper session\n \nELearning -\n\u00a0We have two models for elearning; 1) a price based on org size which starts at $20k for up to 10,000 users, and 2) for smaller organizations we host the modules for $50 for each user (for 12 months). The latter would work best for you folks.\nFoundations of Diversity & Inclusion (all audiences)\nFostering Collaboration (all audiences)\nMini-workshops\nFoundations\u00a0of Diversity & Inclusion\n\u00a0Price is $3,600\n\u00a0per session\nSpotlight on Intersectionality \nPrice is $3,600\u00a0per session\nI realize I am repeating myself with the foundations courses, but I think it's important to offer this in different\u00a0ways so the message clicks for everyone, and also because I don't know that everyone will attend each kind of session. \nCan you tell me what the cost of those selections would be, based on a company of 160 people? We have 50-60 people who are people managers and would be in the manager & leader sessions. \nThank you! \nOn Mon, Mar 10, 2025 at 2:05 PM Chuck Adams < \nc.adams@lcwmail.com\n> wrote: \nHi, Rocio \u2013\n\u00a0\nAttached are the information deck and \u00a0proposal with pricing we discussed. Don\u2019t be put off by the final cost in the proposal. \n\ud83d\ude0a\n\u00a0\u00a0To build the proposal I had to assume some things around the final number of sessions and the specific manager/leader training you might be interested in. Note that any of the products in the deck can be swapped out for assumptions made in the proposal.\n\u00a0\nEither way, think of this as a menu that we can customize accordingly.\n\u00a0\nYou\u2019ll notice that I did not provide pricing on the Diversity Leadership Governance piece yet. I need to talk with the team about how best to represent that outside of the ERG/BRG Consulting Package. As I was reviewing the program I noticed that there wasn\u2019t a clean line item for that piece alone.

While honing your message accurately IS a result of having diverse folks in the decision making process, I think we could mention the higher probability of developing new products and services that appeal to groups outside of a company\u2019s traditional market. \n\u00a0 \nQuestion 3 needs an example statement. \nHow about something like, \u201cI don\u2019t see why we need to spend extra money searching for \nnew\n talent. We've been successful hiring a certain type of worker throughout our history.\u201d \n\u00a0 \nThe examples in Question 4 indirectly respond to the statement. \nA better response might be, \u201cHiring quotas have been illegal for some time. What some confuse with quotas are better described as earnest attempts to ensure that underrepresented workers, however that\u2019s defined in your workplace, aren\u2019t underrepresented because of harmful policies and practices.\u201d \n\u00a0 \nQuestion 5 needs an example statement. \nNot sure that the response resonates as much as it could. Being ignored because of where you grew up seems safe. How might other people know where you grew up? Also, and this is just me, but the only thing divisive about the \u2018identity politics\u2019 is that it offends people who don\u2019t have to consider their identity day to day. \n\u00a0 \nQuestion 6 needs an example statement. \nSomething like, \u201cWhy is any of this important? We\u2019re a company, not a social nonprofit.\u201d \n\u00a0 \nApologies if this is late in the game. If we are going to have the EXAMPLE rows present we need to fill them or remove them. There also isn\u2019t an option statement that ties DEI work to company values, which is what I hear from the companies still committed to this work. For some companies this is still a values play. \n\u00a0 \nChuck Adams\n \n(He/Him)\n \nChief Executive Officer \nLCW \nOffice: \n+1.773.938.4285\n \nMobile: +1.630.373.5068 \n\u00a0 \nWebsite\n\u00a0\n|\n\u00a0\nTwitter\n \n|\n\u00a0\nFacebook\n\u00a0\n|\n\u00a0\nLinkedIn\n \nView our upcoming events\n \n| \nSign-up for our newsletter\n \n\u00a0 \n\u00a0 \n\u00a0\nCOMPANY \nLcwmail\n7737555869\n\u00a0\nCONTACT \nRebecca Parrilla\nr.parrilla@lcwmail.com\n+1.773.938.3784\n\u00a0\nCONTACT \nNicole Barile\nn.barile@lcwmail.com\n\u00a0\nCONTACT \nAndrea Bowles\na.wicksbowles@lcwmail.com\n773-938-4181\n\u00a0\nView in HubSpot\n\u00a0\nThis message was sent to \np.seminario@lcwmail.com\n because your preferences are set to receive notifications like this. \n\u00a0\n\u00a0\nTurn off\n \"Activity on record you own or follow\" email notifications. \u00a0\n\u00a0\nlcwinclusion.com\n (Hub ID: 23618458) \nHubSpot, Inc.\n2 Canal Park\nCambridge, MA 02141",
