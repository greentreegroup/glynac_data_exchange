Looking at the work order I see there are remarks made regarding edits to video work from Diligent's\u00a0own library. See below. This is where you would ask them if you are wanting LCW to do the video editing customizations outlined here. If so, I can provide a quote. You just want to get clarification if they want LCW to do the videos, so that you bake that time into the quote.\nIn order to develop\u00a0an English Code of Conduct for Diligent, we've found it can estimate between 10hrs-15hrs depending on their customization template, included in the files shared with us. It looks average length, but since they are going with a new design template, it remains at 12hrs for myself to build. If you look at the Languages section of the Work Order, this is where I quote implementing each translation into a module. It averages 1-2hrs per language, with some right-to-left languages requiring more adjustments and sometimes being 3hrs.\u00a0\nYou can use the numbers I sent for a quote but they won't need too much additional information other than turnaround time. I see that the client was frustrated so I offered the two turnaround times if it helps. They are\u00a0familiar with the overall work process, but I'm more than happy to help mitigate some of those emails or hop on a call to talk workflow if it helps.\nLet me know if you are looking for something different or need more responses for the client conversation.\nBest,\nDustin\nOn Thu, Mar 13, 2025 at 10:08\u202fAM Jorgelina Venturi <\nj.venturi@lcwmail.com\n> wrote:\n\ufeff\nT\nhank you so much!\n\u00a0\nJorgelina (Lina) Venturi\nTranslation Specialist\nLCW\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\nFrom: \nElixir Multimedia Solutions <\nelixirmultimediasolutions@gmail.com\n>\nDate: \nThursday, 13 March 2025 at 12:02\n\u202f\nPM\nTo: \nJorgelina Venturi <\nj.venturi@lcwmail.com\n>\nCc: \nNicole Barile <\nn.barile@lcwmail.com\n>, Cecilia Mariotta <\nc.mariotta@lcwmail.com\n>, Keri Luo <\nk.luo@lcwmail.com\n>\nSubject: \nRe: Diligent/LCW - CoC Quote Request - GXO URGENT\nOf course.

They just sent an update to confirm the Delmonte project. Dustin is doing this, so I shared this email with Dustin (copied you) & asked him to complete this project right away (by end of day Friday).\n\u00a0\nDiligent mentioned that there have been slow downs in turnaround times (which I think is caused by Dustin not answering us quickly).\n\u00a0\nThey also mentioned that some comments in Articulate have been missed. I also believe this was from some missed things by Dustin.\n\u00a0\nDustin is aware of these issues.\nThat's why we are moving to Keri in hopes that she can do things quickly.\u00a0\n\u00a0\nLet's talk more about this on our call Thursday \n@Cecilia Mariotta\n. I want to make sure you have everything you need & that we have a plan to fix these issues.\n\u00a0\nWe will probably have to have a call with Keri as well - the 3 of us. I will set that up soon.\nThank you!",

    "body": "Hi Lina,\nHonestly, I have no idea what the quote is. Usually, Dustin asked me to design a PPT template with the client\u2019s branding for their review if it\u2019s a new eLearning course, although they all seem to be based on a premade course. Once the client approved the PPT design, Dustin created the English course and then lets translators translate it into the required languages. After that, Dustin puts the different languages into Storyline.\n\u00a0\nThat\u2019s what I understand about the Diligent process.

Dustin is doing this, so I shared this email with Dustin (copied you) & asked him to complete this project right away (by end of day Friday).\nDiligent mentioned that there have been slow downs in turnaround times (which I think is caused by Dustin not answering us quickly).\nThey also mentioned that some comments in Articulate have been missed. I also believe this was from some missed things by Dustin.\nDustin is aware of these issues.\nThat's why we are moving to Keri in hopes that she can do things quickly.\u00a0\nLet's talk more about this on our call Thursday \n@Cecilia Mariotta\n. I want to make sure you have everything you need & that we have a plan to fix these issues.\nWe will probably have to have a call with Keri as well - the 3 of us. I will set that up soon.\nThank you!",

We can adjust the\u00a0package to give them scores or try to adapt to their system of distinguishing learners with such limited LMS reporting features. But as shown with our testing, the packages have worked and we'll need their LMS to send us the exact settings that will be needed to accompany Del Monte's method of how they plan to distinguish learners who said Yes or No on the questionnaire.\u00a0\n\u00a0\nPerhaps their system only shows a complete pass/fail scenario? We'd need guidance from their LMS on how scores are captured and if it can distinguish a 50% score that \"fails\" but still passes the course.\u00a0\n\u00a0\nPlease note our so long back and forth comes from their limiting system and as you can notice we are flexible and doing our best to help them get what they need.\nPlease let us know.\nWe are happy to help.\nBest,\nCDS\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\nCatalina De Sanctis\nTranslation Specialist\nLCW\n\u00a0\nWebsite\n\u00a0| \nTwitter\n\u00a0| \nFacebook\n\u00a0| \nLinkedIn\nView our upcoming events\n\u00a0| \nSign-up for our newsletter\n\u00a0\nFrom:\n\u00a0Randi Mooney <rmooney@diligent.com>\nSent:\n\u00a0Thursday, February 20, 2025 1:49 PM\nTo:\n\u00a0Catalina De Sanctis <c.desanctis@lcwmail.com>\nCc:\n\u00a0Brian Luong <bluong@diligent.com>; Don Reyes <dreyes@diligent.com>; Karen Lai <klai@diligent.com>; Kumud Mishra <kmishra@diligent.com>; Jorgelina Venturi <j.venturi@lcwmail.com>\nSubject:\n\u00a0Re: Diligent - WO_DELMONTE_COC_080624 - Del Monte CoC\n\u00a0\nHello,\n\u00a0\nDel Monte will be following up with their LMS on this matter.

This method involves the least amount of scope increase since we're at the translation phase. See below for what I did to the package to relay to them. Then can use the Menu to skip to the Certification slide to test both clickable decisions.\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\nOn the screen below, when the learner selects the No, the course will complete when the final slide loads. If the learner selects Yes, then the course will register as incomplete when reaching the final slide. \nIf this is not enough for them, please have Del Monte describe how they are going to mitigate this issue for themselves internally with the limitations of their LMS, and we can adjust the package accordingly. \nSince their LMS doesn't allow the reportage they want, they need to decide how they are going to reach out to people who appear incomplete if this isn't good enough. That may even need to include adding language to the course that would then need translation. Reconfiguration/Testing of the course for numerical scores to be sent to signal the selected response in question, would take 1hr per language to adjust totaling $1400 ($140*10lg) additional to the scope on my end. The adjustment I did here would only increase the scope between $140-$280 overall to apply the fix.\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\nPlease let us know your comments.\nThanks!\nCDS\n\u00a0\nCatalina De Sanctis\nTranslation Specialist\nLCW\n\u00a0\nWebsite\n\u00a0| \nTwitter\n\u00a0| \nFacebook\n\u00a0| \nLinkedIn\nView our upcoming events\n\u00a0| \nSign-up for our newsletter\n\u00a0\nFrom:\n\u00a0Randi Mooney <\nrmooney@diligent.com\n>\nSent:\n\u00a0Tuesday, February 11, 2025 2:31 PM\nTo:\n\u00a0Catalina De Sanctis <\nc.desanctis@lcwmail.com\n>\nCc:\n\u00a0Brian Luong <\nbluong@diligent.com\n>; Don Reyes <\ndreyes@diligent.com\n>; Karen Lai <\nklai@diligent.com\n>; Kumud Mishra <\nkmishra@diligent.com\n>\nSubject:\n\u00a0Re: Diligent - WO_DELMONTE_COC_080624 - Del Monte CoC\n\u00a0\nHi Catalina,\n\u00a0\nI wanted to follow up to see if Dustin's new test file for Del Monte is ready?

But in the meantime, sent over an invite for Friday.\n\u00a0\nHere is a summary of the situation:\nDel Monte noted earlier this week that the SCORM 2004 test file worked well in their LMS but followed up asking if we could send them their test report.\nWe informed them that without explicit access to their LMS and metadata, it would not be possible to generate a report on their behalf.\nThey replied that their LMS does not allow for any reports to be exported. This is where the misunderstanding occurred.\nEarlier in the project, it was interpreted that they were not getting the desired information from SCORM 1.2 completion reports. That is why we decided to proceed with SCORM 2004 as it allows for customized reportage.\nWe have asked Del Monte to confirm with their LMS, Convercent, what type of reports or metadata can be generated or exported. Awaiting a response here.\nQuestions to discuss:\nIs there any way to run a report on behalf\u00a0of Del Monte?\nHave reporting capabilities been brought up in the prior year updates for Del Monte? If so, what was the recommendation?\nThanks!\n_________________________\nDiligent\nRandi Mooney (Doran),\n\u00a0she/her\nAdvisory Specialist II, Advisory & Consulting Services\nrmooney@diligent.com\n\u00a0| \ndiligent.com\n\u00a0\nFrom:\n\u00a0Catalina De Sanctis <\nc.desanctis@lcwmail.com\n>\nSent:\n\u00a0Wednesday, January 29, 2025 7:23 PM\nTo:\n\u00a0Randi Mooney <\nrmooney@diligent.com\n>; Brian Luong <\nbluong@diligent.com\n>\nCc:\n\u00a0Don Reyes <\ndreyes@diligent.com\n>; Karen Lai <\nklai@diligent.com\n>; Kumud Mishra <\nkmishra@diligent.com\n>\nSubject:\n\u00a0RE: Diligent - WO_DELMONTE_COC_080624 - Del Monte CoC\n\u00a0\nHello Randi,\nIm sorry, tomorrow is complicated.

We can adjust the\u00a0package to give them scores or try to adapt to their system of distinguishing learners with such limited LMS reporting features. But as shown with our testing, the packages have worked and we'll need their LMS to send us the exact settings that will be needed to accompany Del Monte's method of how they plan to distinguish learners who said Yes or No on the questionnaire.\u00a0\n\u00a0\nPerhaps their system only shows a complete pass/fail scenario? We'd need guidance from their LMS on how scores are captured and if it can distinguish a 50% score that \"fails\" but still passes the course.\u00a0\n\u00a0\nPlease note our so long back and forth comes from their limiting system and as you can notice we are flexible and doing our best to help them get what they need.\nPlease let us know.\nWe are happy to help.\nBest,\nCDS\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\nCatalina De Sanctis\nTranslation Specialist\nLCW\n\u00a0\nWebsite\n\u00a0| \nTwitter\n\u00a0| \nFacebook\n\u00a0| \nLinkedIn\nView our upcoming events\n\u00a0| \nSign-up for our newsletter\n\u00a0\nFrom:\n\u00a0Randi Mooney <rmooney@diligent.com>\nSent:\n\u00a0Thursday, February 20, 2025 1:49 PM\nTo:\n\u00a0Catalina De Sanctis <c.desanctis@lcwmail.com>\nCc:\n\u00a0Brian Luong <bluong@diligent.com>; Don Reyes <dreyes@diligent.com>; Karen Lai <klai@diligent.com>; Kumud Mishra <kmishra@diligent.com>; Jorgelina Venturi <j.venturi@lcwmail.com>\nSubject:\n\u00a0Re: Diligent - WO_DELMONTE_COC_080624 - Del Monte CoC\n\u00a0\nHello,\n\u00a0\nDel Monte will be following up with their LMS on this matter. Also including another \ncomment \nDel Monte provided below:\n\u00a0\nI just sent the question to Convercent but in the screenshot shared, it showed a score of 100 for completion and a blank score for incompletion, so I don't think it is pass/fail score? The issue we have is that we can't distinguish all blank scores that are incomplete, and we don't know if in fact they completed the course. We could even be ok with a blank score if the participant was able to complete the course.\n\u00a0\nThanks,\n_________________________\nDiligent\nRandi Mooney,\n\u00a0she/her\nAdvisory Specialist II, Advisory & Consulting Services\nrmooney@diligent.com\n\u00a0| \ndiligent.com\n\u00a0\nUpcoming PTO: February 20th - February 25th\n\u00a0\nFrom:\n\u00a0Catalina De Sanctis <\nc.desanctis@lcwmail.com\n>\nSent:\n\u00a0Thursday, February 20, 2025 9:56 AM\nTo:\n\u00a0Randi Mooney <\nrmooney@diligent.com\n>\nCc:\n\u00a0Brian Luong <\nbluong@diligent.com\n>; Don Reyes <\ndreyes@diligent.com\n>; Karen Lai <\nklai@diligent.com\n>; Kumud Mishra <\nkmishra@diligent.com\n>; Jorgelina Venturi <\nj.venturi@lcwmail.com\n>\nSubject:\n\u00a0RE: Diligent - WO_DELMONTE_COC_080624 - Del Monte CoC\n\u00a0\nEXTERNAL:\u00a0This email originated from outside of the organization.

This method involves the least amount of scope increase since we're at the translation phase. See below for what I did to the package to relay to them. Then can use the Menu to skip to the Certification slide to test both clickable decisions.\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\nOn the screen below, when the learner selects the No, the course will complete when the final slide loads. If the learner selects Yes, then the course will register as incomplete when reaching the final slide. \nIf this is not enough for them, please have Del Monte describe how they are going to mitigate this issue for themselves internally with the limitations of their LMS, and we can adjust the package accordingly. \nSince their LMS doesn't allow the reportage they want, they need to decide how they are going to reach out to people who appear incomplete if this isn't good enough. That may even need to include adding language to the course that would then need translation. Reconfiguration/Testing of the course for numerical scores to be sent to signal the selected response in question, would take 1hr per language to adjust totaling $1400 ($140*10lg) additional to the scope on my end. The adjustment I did here would only increase the scope between $140-$280 overall to apply the fix.\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\nPlease let us know your comments.\nThanks!\nCDS\n\u00a0\nCatalina De Sanctis\nTranslation Specialist\nLCW\n\u00a0\nWebsite\n\u00a0| \nTwitter\n\u00a0| \nFacebook\n\u00a0| \nLinkedIn\nView our upcoming events\n\u00a0| \nSign-up for our newsletter\n\u00a0\nFrom:\n\u00a0Randi Mooney <\nrmooney@diligent.com\n>\nSent:\n\u00a0Tuesday, February 11, 2025 2:31 PM\nTo:\n\u00a0Catalina De Sanctis <\nc.desanctis@lcwmail.com\n>\nCc:\n\u00a0Brian Luong <\nbluong@diligent.com\n>; Don Reyes <\ndreyes@diligent.com\n>; Karen Lai <\nklai@diligent.com\n>; Kumud Mishra <\nkmishra@diligent.com\n>\nSubject:\n\u00a0Re: Diligent - WO_DELMONTE_COC_080624 - Del Monte CoC\n\u00a0\nHi Catalina,\n\u00a0\nI wanted to follow up to see if Dustin's new test file for Del Monte is ready?

But in the meantime, sent over an invite for Friday.\n\u00a0\nHere is a summary of the situation:\nDel Monte noted earlier this week that the SCORM 2004 test file worked well in their LMS but followed up asking if we could send them their test report.\nWe informed them that without explicit access to their LMS and metadata, it would not be possible to generate a report on their behalf.\nThey replied that their LMS does not allow for any reports to be exported. This is where the misunderstanding occurred.\nEarlier in the project, it was interpreted that they were not getting the desired information from SCORM 1.2 completion reports. That is why we decided to proceed with SCORM 2004 as it allows for customized reportage.\nWe have asked Del Monte to confirm with their LMS, Convercent, what type of reports or metadata can be generated or exported. Awaiting a response here.\nQuestions to discuss:\nIs there any way to run a report on behalf\u00a0of Del Monte?\nHave reporting capabilities been brought up in the prior year updates for Del Monte? If so, what was the recommendation?\nThanks!\n_________________________\nDiligent\nRandi Mooney (Doran),\n\u00a0she/her\nAdvisory Specialist II, Advisory & Consulting Services\nrmooney@diligent.com\n\u00a0| \ndiligent.com\n\u00a0\nFrom:\n\u00a0Catalina De Sanctis <\nc.desanctis@lcwmail.com\n>\nSent:\n\u00a0Wednesday, January 29, 2025 7:23 PM\nTo:\n\u00a0Randi Mooney <\nrmooney@diligent.com\n>; Brian Luong <\nbluong@diligent.com\n>\nCc:\n\u00a0Don Reyes <\ndreyes@diligent.com\n>; Karen Lai <\nklai@diligent.com\n>; Kumud Mishra <\nkmishra@diligent.com\n>\nSubject:\n\u00a0RE: Diligent - WO_DELMONTE_COC_080624 - Del Monte CoC\n\u00a0\nHello Randi,\nIm sorry, tomorrow is complicated.

Please let me know once you have an ETA for these updates to be completed.\n\u00a0\nPlease see their comment regarding translations below:\n\u00a0\n\u201c \nOur translator provided the French version in the attached customisation template. I don\u2019t know if that is helpful now. Our Brazilian colleague is also prepared to review the Portuguese translation once ready. Hopefully, the Dilignt team can use some of the previous translation work as a few of the slides have the same if not very similar content from previous years.\u201d\n\u00a0\nI have uploaded the French version of their customization template into SFS for now. However, I know that historically we provide them a word document to translate onto so that may have to be a copy/ paste exercise for their internal team once the ENG course is finalized.\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\nThank you,\nKaren\n\u00a0\nFrom:\n\u00a0Catalina De Sanctis <\nc.desanctis@lcwmail.com\n>\nSent:\n\u00a0Thursday, January 16, 2025 11:21 AM\nTo:\n\u00a0Karen Lai <\nklai@diligent.com\n>\nCc:\n\u00a0Brian Luong <\nbluong@diligent.com\n>; Don Reyes <\ndreyes@diligent.com\n>; Randi Mooney <\nrmooney@diligent.com\n>\nSubject:\n\u00a0RE: Altera COC Update- Quote Request: WO_Altera_COC_121824\n\u00a0\nHello Karen,\nThis is ready!\n\u00a0\nArticulate review was down yesterday during upload times.\n\u00a0\nhttps://360.articulate.com/review/content/a0874e90-033c-4815-879b-de938e06bc72/review\n\u00a0\nKindly,\nCDS\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\nCatalina De Sanctis\nTranslation Specialist\nLCW\n\u00a0\nLCW will be closed on Monday January 20\nth\n\u00a0in observance to Martin Luther King Jr\u2019s Holiday which this year is also the U.S Presidential Inauguration day.\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\nWebsite\n\u00a0| \nTwitter\n\u00a0| \nFacebook\n\u00a0| \nLinkedIn\nView our upcoming events\n\u00a0| \nSign-up for our newsletter\n\u00a0\nFrom:\n\u00a0Karen Lai <\nklai@diligent.com\n>\nSent:\n\u00a0Thursday, January 2, 2025 11:47 AM\nTo:\n\u00a0Catalina De Sanctis <\nc.desanctis@lcwmail.com\n>\nCc:\n\u00a0Brian Luong <\nbluong@diligent.com\n>; Don Reyes <\ndreyes@diligent.com\n>; Randi Mooney <\nrmooney@diligent.com\n>\nSubject:\n\u00a0RE: Altera COC Update- Quote Request: WO_Altera_COC_121824\n\u00a0\nHi Catalina,\n\u00a0\nHappy New Year- please proceed with the ENG and POR (BR) build for now.

We can adjust the\u00a0package to give them scores or try to adapt to their system of distinguishing learners with such limited LMS reporting features. But as shown with our testing, the packages have worked and we'll need their LMS to send us the exact settings that will be needed to accompany Del Monte's method of how they plan to distinguish learners who said Yes or No on the questionnaire.\u00a0\n\u00a0\nPerhaps their system only shows a complete pass/fail scenario? We'd need guidance from their LMS on how scores are captured and if it can distinguish a 50% score that \"fails\" but still passes the course.\u00a0\n\u00a0\nPlease note our so long back and forth comes from their limiting system and as you can notice we are flexible and doing our best to help them get what they need.\nPlease let us know.\nWe are happy to help.\nBest,\nCDS\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\nCatalina De Sanctis\nTranslation Specialist\nLCW\n\u00a0\nWebsite\n\u00a0| \nTwitter\n\u00a0| \nFacebook\n\u00a0| \nLinkedIn\nView our upcoming events\n\u00a0| \nSign-up for our newsletter\n\u00a0\nFrom:\n\u00a0Randi Mooney <rmooney@diligent.com>\nSent:\n\u00a0Thursday, February 20, 2025 1:49 PM\nTo:\n\u00a0Catalina De Sanctis <c.desanctis@lcwmail.com>\nCc:\n\u00a0Brian Luong <bluong@diligent.com>; Don Reyes <dreyes@diligent.com>; Karen Lai <klai@diligent.com>; Kumud Mishra <kmishra@diligent.com>; Jorgelina Venturi <j.venturi@lcwmail.com>\nSubject:\n\u00a0Re: Diligent - WO_DELMONTE_COC_080624 - Del Monte CoC\n\u00a0\nHello,\n\u00a0\nDel Monte will be following up with their LMS on this matter.

The issue we have is that we can't distinguish all blank scores that are incomplete, and we don't know if in fact they completed the course.

This method involves the least amount of scope increase since we're at the translation phase. See below for what I did to the package to relay to them. Then can use the Menu to skip to the Certification slide to test both clickable decisions.\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\nOn the screen below, when the learner selects the No, the course will complete when the final slide loads. If the learner selects Yes, then the course will register as incomplete when reaching the final slide. \nIf this is not enough for them, please have Del Monte describe how they are going to mitigate this issue for themselves internally with the limitations of their LMS, and we can adjust the package accordingly. \nSince their LMS doesn't allow the reportage they want, they need to decide how they are going to reach out to people who appear incomplete if this isn't good enough. That may even need to include adding language to the course that would then need translation. Reconfiguration/Testing of the course for numerical scores to be sent to signal the selected response in question, would take 1hr per language to adjust totaling $1400 ($140*10lg) additional to the scope on my end. The adjustment I did here would only increase the scope between $140-$280 overall to apply the fix.\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\nPlease let us know your comments.\nThanks!\nCDS\n\u00a0\nCatalina De Sanctis\nTranslation Specialist\nLCW\n\u00a0\nWebsite\n\u00a0| \nTwitter\n\u00a0| \nFacebook\n\u00a0| \nLinkedIn\nView our upcoming events\n\u00a0| \nSign-up for our newsletter\n\u00a0\nFrom:\n\u00a0Randi Mooney <\nrmooney@diligent.com\n>\nSent:\n\u00a0Tuesday, February 11, 2025 2:31 PM\nTo:\n\u00a0Catalina De Sanctis <\nc.desanctis@lcwmail.com\n>\nCc:\n\u00a0Brian Luong <\nbluong@diligent.com\n>; Don Reyes <\ndreyes@diligent.com\n>; Karen Lai <\nklai@diligent.com\n>; Kumud Mishra <\nkmishra@diligent.com\n>\nSubject:\n\u00a0Re: Diligent - WO_DELMONTE_COC_080624 - Del Monte CoC\n\u00a0\nHi Catalina,\n\u00a0\nI wanted to follow up to see if Dustin's new test file for Del Monte is ready?

But in the meantime, sent over an invite for Friday.\n\u00a0\nHere is a summary of the situation:\nDel Monte noted earlier this week that the SCORM 2004 test file worked well in their LMS but followed up asking if we could send them their test report.\nWe informed them that without explicit access to their LMS and metadata, it would not be possible to generate a report on their behalf.\nThey replied that their LMS does not allow for any reports to be exported. This is where the misunderstanding occurred.\nEarlier in the project, it was interpreted that they were not getting the desired information from SCORM 1.2 completion reports. That is why we decided to proceed with SCORM 2004 as it allows for customized reportage.\nWe have asked Del Monte to confirm with their LMS, Convercent, what type of reports or metadata can be generated or exported. Awaiting a response here.\nQuestions to discuss:\nIs there any way to run a report on behalf\u00a0of Del Monte?\nHave reporting capabilities been brought up in the prior year updates for Del Monte? If so, what was the recommendation?\nThanks!\n_________________________\nDiligent\nRandi Mooney (Doran),\n\u00a0she/her\nAdvisory Specialist II, Advisory & Consulting Services\nrmooney@diligent.com\n\u00a0| \ndiligent.com\n\u00a0\nFrom:\n\u00a0Catalina De Sanctis <\nc.desanctis@lcwmail.com\n>\nSent:\n\u00a0Wednesday, January 29, 2025 7:23 PM\nTo:\n\u00a0Randi Mooney <\nrmooney@diligent.com\n>; Brian Luong <\nbluong@diligent.com\n>\nCc:\n\u00a0Don Reyes <\ndreyes@diligent.com\n>; Karen Lai <\nklai@diligent.com\n>; Kumud Mishra <\nkmishra@diligent.com\n>\nSubject:\n\u00a0RE: Diligent - WO_DELMONTE_COC_080624 - Del Monte CoC\n\u00a0\nHello Randi,\nIm sorry, tomorrow is complicated.

We can adjust the\u00a0package to give them scores or try to adapt to their system of distinguishing learners with such limited LMS reporting features. But as shown with our testing, the packages have worked and we'll need their LMS to send us the exact settings that will be needed to accompany Del Monte's method of how they plan to distinguish learners who said Yes or No on the questionnaire.\u00a0\n\u00a0\nPerhaps their system only shows a complete pass/fail scenario? We'd need guidance from their LMS on how scores are captured and if it can distinguish a 50% score that \"fails\" but still passes the course.\u00a0\n\u00a0\nPlease note our so long back and forth comes from their limiting system and as you can notice we are flexible and doing our best to help them get what they need.\nPlease let us know.\nWe are happy to help.\nBest,\nCDS\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\nCatalina De Sanctis\nTranslation Specialist\nLCW\n\u00a0\nWebsite\n\u00a0| \nTwitter\n\u00a0| \nFacebook\n\u00a0| \nLinkedIn\nView our upcoming events\n\u00a0| \nSign-up for our newsletter\n\u00a0\nFrom:\n\u00a0Randi Mooney <rmooney@diligent.com>\nSent:\n\u00a0Thursday, February 20, 2025 1:49 PM\nTo:\n\u00a0Catalina De Sanctis <c.desanctis@lcwmail.com>\nCc:\n\u00a0Brian Luong <bluong@diligent.com>; Don Reyes <dreyes@diligent.com>; Karen Lai <klai@diligent.com>; Kumud Mishra <kmishra@diligent.com>; Jorgelina Venturi <j.venturi@lcwmail.com>\nSubject:\n\u00a0Re: Diligent - WO_DELMONTE_COC_080624 - Del Monte CoC\n\u00a0\nHello,\n\u00a0\nDel Monte will be following up with their LMS on this matter. Also including another \ncomment \nDel Monte provided below:\n\u00a0\nI just sent the question to Convercent but in the screenshot shared, it showed a score of 100 for completion and a blank score for incompletion, so I don't think it is pass/fail score? The issue we have is that we can't distinguish all blank scores that are incomplete, and we don't know if in fact they completed the course. We could even be ok with a blank score if the participant was able to complete the course.\n\u00a0\nThanks,\n_________________________\nDiligent\nRandi Mooney,\n\u00a0she/her\nAdvisory Specialist II, Advisory & Consulting Services\nrmooney@diligent.com\n\u00a0| \ndiligent.com\n\u00a0\nUpcoming PTO: February 20th - February 25th\n\u00a0\nFrom:\n\u00a0Catalina De Sanctis <\nc.desanctis@lcwmail.com\n>\nSent:\n\u00a0Thursday, February 20, 2025 9:56 AM\nTo:\n\u00a0Randi Mooney <\nrmooney@diligent.com\n>\nCc:\n\u00a0Brian Luong <\nbluong@diligent.com\n>; Don Reyes <\ndreyes@diligent.com\n>; Karen Lai <\nklai@diligent.com\n>; Kumud Mishra <\nkmishra@diligent.com\n>; Jorgelina Venturi <\nj.venturi@lcwmail.com\n>\nSubject:\n\u00a0RE: Diligent - WO_DELMONTE_COC_080624 - Del Monte CoC\n\u00a0\nEXTERNAL:\u00a0This email originated from outside of the organization.

This method involves the least amount of scope increase since we're at the translation phase. See below for what I did to the package to relay to them. Then can use the Menu to skip to the Certification slide to test both clickable decisions.\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\nOn the screen below, when the learner selects the No, the course will complete when the final slide loads. If the learner selects Yes, then the course will register as incomplete when reaching the final slide. \nIf this is not enough for them, please have Del Monte describe how they are going to mitigate this issue for themselves internally with the limitations of their LMS, and we can adjust the package accordingly. \nSince their LMS doesn't allow the reportage they want, they need to decide how they are going to reach out to people who appear incomplete if this isn't good enough. That may even need to include adding language to the course that would then need translation. Reconfiguration/Testing of the course for numerical scores to be sent to signal the selected response in question, would take 1hr per language to adjust totaling $1400 ($140*10lg) additional to the scope on my end. The adjustment I did here would only increase the scope between $140-$280 overall to apply the fix.\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\nPlease let us know your comments.\nThanks!\nCDS\n\u00a0\nCatalina De Sanctis\nTranslation Specialist\nLCW\n\u00a0\nWebsite\n\u00a0| \nTwitter\n\u00a0| \nFacebook\n\u00a0| \nLinkedIn\nView our upcoming events\n\u00a0| \nSign-up for our newsletter\n\u00a0\nFrom:\n\u00a0Randi Mooney <\nrmooney@diligent.com\n>\nSent:\n\u00a0Tuesday, February 11, 2025 2:31 PM\nTo:\n\u00a0Catalina De Sanctis <\nc.desanctis@lcwmail.com\n>\nCc:\n\u00a0Brian Luong <\nbluong@diligent.com\n>; Don Reyes <\ndreyes@diligent.com\n>; Karen Lai <\nklai@diligent.com\n>; Kumud Mishra <\nkmishra@diligent.com\n>\nSubject:\n\u00a0Re: Diligent - WO_DELMONTE_COC_080624 - Del Monte CoC\n\u00a0\nHi Catalina,\n\u00a0\nI wanted to follow up to see if Dustin's new test file for Del Monte is ready?

But in the meantime, sent over an invite for Friday.\n\u00a0\nHere is a summary of the situation:\nDel Monte noted earlier this week that the SCORM 2004 test file worked well in their LMS but followed up asking if we could send them their test report.\nWe informed them that without explicit access to their LMS and metadata, it would not be possible to generate a report on their behalf.\nThey replied that their LMS does not allow for any reports to be exported. This is where the misunderstanding occurred.\nEarlier in the project, it was interpreted that they were not getting the desired information from SCORM 1.2 completion reports. That is why we decided to proceed with SCORM 2004 as it allows for customized reportage.\nWe have asked Del Monte to confirm with their LMS, Convercent, what type of reports or metadata can be generated or exported. Awaiting a response here.\nQuestions to discuss:\nIs there any way to run a report on behalf\u00a0of Del Monte?\nHave reporting capabilities been brought up in the prior year updates for Del Monte? If so, what was the recommendation?\nThanks!\n_________________________\nDiligent\nRandi Mooney (Doran),\n\u00a0she/her\nAdvisory Specialist II, Advisory & Consulting Services\nrmooney@diligent.com\n\u00a0| \ndiligent.com\n\u00a0\nFrom:\n\u00a0Catalina De Sanctis <\nc.desanctis@lcwmail.com\n>\nSent:\n\u00a0Wednesday, January 29, 2025 7:23 PM\nTo:\n\u00a0Randi Mooney <\nrmooney@diligent.com\n>; Brian Luong <\nbluong@diligent.com\n>\nCc:\n\u00a0Don Reyes <\ndreyes@diligent.com\n>; Karen Lai <\nklai@diligent.com\n>; Kumud Mishra <\nkmishra@diligent.com\n>\nSubject:\n\u00a0RE: Diligent - WO_DELMONTE_COC_080624 - Del Monte CoC\n\u00a0\nHello Randi,\nIm sorry, tomorrow is complicated.

This method involves the least amount of scope increase since we're at the translation phase. See below for what I did to the package to relay to them. Then can use the Menu to skip to the Certification slide to test both clickable decisions.\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\nOn the screen below, when the learner selects the No, the course will complete when the final slide loads. If the learner selects Yes, then the course will register as incomplete when reaching the final slide. \nIf this is not enough for them, please have Del Monte describe how they are going to mitigate this issue for themselves internally with the limitations of their LMS, and we can adjust the package accordingly. \nSince their LMS doesn't allow the reportage they want, they need to decide how they are going to reach out to people who appear incomplete if this isn't good enough. That may even need to include adding language to the course that would then need translation. Reconfiguration/Testing of the course for numerical scores to be sent to signal the selected response in question, would take 1hr per language to adjust totaling $715 additional to the scope on my end. The adjustment I did here would only increase the scope between $65-$130 overall to apply the fix.\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\nLet me know if you have any questions.\u00a0\n\u00a0\nBest,\nDustin\n\u00a0\nDisclaimer\nThe information contained in this communication from the sender is confidential.

This method involves the least amount of scope increase since we're at the translation phase. See below for what I did to the package to relay to them. Then can use the Menu to skip to the Certification slide to test both clickable decisions.\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\nOn the screen below, when the learner selects the No, the course will complete when the final slide loads. If the learner selects Yes, then the course will register as incomplete when reaching the final slide. \nIf this is not enough for them, please have Del Monte describe how they are going to mitigate this issue for themselves internally with the limitations of their LMS, and we can adjust the package accordingly. \nSince their LMS doesn't allow the reportage they want, they need to decide how they are going to reach out to people who appear incomplete if this isn't good enough. That may even need to include adding language to the course that would then need translation. Reconfiguration/Testing of the course for numerical scores to be sent to signal the selected response in question, would take 1hr per language to adjust totaling $1400 ($140*10lg) additional to the scope on my end. The adjustment I did here would only increase the scope between $140-$280 overall to apply the fix.\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\nPlease let us know your comments.\nThanks!\nCDS\n\u00a0\nCatalina De Sanctis\nTranslation Specialist\nLCW\n\u00a0\nWebsite\n\u00a0| \nTwitter\n\u00a0| \nFacebook\n\u00a0| \nLinkedIn\nView our upcoming events\n\u00a0| \nSign-up for our newsletter\n\u00a0\nFrom:\n\u00a0Randi Mooney <\nrmooney@diligent.com\n>\nSent:\n\u00a0Tuesday, February 11, 2025 2:31 PM\nTo:\n\u00a0Catalina De Sanctis <\nc.desanctis@lcwmail.com\n>\nCc:\n\u00a0Brian Luong <\nbluong@diligent.com\n>; Don Reyes <\ndreyes@diligent.com\n>; Karen Lai <\nklai@diligent.com\n>; Kumud Mishra <\nkmishra@diligent.com\n>\nSubject:\n\u00a0Re: Diligent - WO_DELMONTE_COC_080624 - Del Monte CoC\n\u00a0\nHi Catalina,\n\u00a0\nI wanted to follow up to see if Dustin's new test file for Del Monte is ready?

But in the meantime, sent over an invite for Friday.\n\u00a0\nHere is a summary of the situation:\nDel Monte noted earlier this week that the SCORM 2004 test file worked well in their LMS but followed up asking if we could send them their test report.\nWe informed them that without explicit access to their LMS and metadata, it would not be possible to generate a report on their behalf.\nThey replied that their LMS does not allow for any reports to be exported. This is where the misunderstanding occurred.\nEarlier in the project, it was interpreted that they were not getting the desired information from SCORM 1.2 completion reports. That is why we decided to proceed with SCORM 2004 as it allows for customized reportage.\nWe have asked Del Monte to confirm with their LMS, Convercent, what type of reports or metadata can be generated or exported. Awaiting a response here.\nQuestions to discuss:\nIs there any way to run a report on behalf\u00a0of Del Monte?\nHave reporting capabilities been brought up in the prior year updates for Del Monte? If so, what was the recommendation?\nThanks!\n_________________________\nDiligent\nRandi Mooney (Doran),\n\u00a0she/her\nAdvisory Specialist II, Advisory & Consulting Services\nrmooney@diligent.com\n\u00a0| \ndiligent.com\n\u00a0\nFrom:\n\u00a0Catalina De Sanctis <\nc.desanctis@lcwmail.com\n>\nSent:\n\u00a0Wednesday, January 29, 2025 7:23 PM\nTo:\n\u00a0Randi Mooney <\nrmooney@diligent.com\n>; Brian Luong <\nbluong@diligent.com\n>\nCc:\n\u00a0Don Reyes <\ndreyes@diligent.com\n>; Karen Lai <\nklai@diligent.com\n>; Kumud Mishra <\nkmishra@diligent.com\n>\nSubject:\n\u00a0RE: Diligent - WO_DELMONTE_COC_080624 - Del Monte CoC\n\u00a0\nHello Randi,\nIm sorry, tomorrow is complicated.

This method involves the least amount of scope increase since we're at the translation phase. See below for what I did to the package to relay to them. Then can use the Menu to skip to the Certification slide to test both clickable decisions.\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\nOn the screen below, when the learner selects the No, the course will complete when the final slide loads. If the learner selects Yes, then the course will register as incomplete when reaching the final slide. \nIf this is not enough for them, please have Del Monte describe how they are going to mitigate this issue for themselves internally with the limitations of their LMS, and we can adjust the package accordingly. \nSince their LMS doesn't allow the reportage they want, they need to decide how they are going to reach out to people who appear incomplete if this isn't good enough. That may even need to include adding language to the course that would then need translation. Reconfiguration/Testing of the course for numerical scores to be sent to signal the selected response in question, would take 1hr per language to adjust totaling $715 additional to the scope on my end. The adjustment I did here would only increase the scope between $65-$130 overall to apply the fix.\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\nLet me know if you have any questions.\u00a0\n\u00a0\nBest,\nDustin\n\u00a0\nDisclaimer\nThe information contained in this communication from the sender is confidential.

This method involves the least amount of scope increase since we're at the translation phase. See below for what I did to the package to relay to them. Then can use the Menu to skip to the Certification slide to test both clickable decisions.\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\nOn the screen below, when the learner selects the No, the course will complete when the final slide loads. If the learner selects Yes, then the course will register as incomplete when reaching the final slide. \nIf this is not enough for them, please have Del Monte describe how they are going to mitigate this issue for themselves internally with the limitations of their LMS, and we can adjust the package accordingly. \nSince their LMS doesn't allow the reportage they want, they need to decide how they are going to reach out to people who appear incomplete if this isn't good enough. That may even need to include adding language to the course that would then need translation. Reconfiguration/Testing of the course for numerical scores to be sent to signal the selected response in question, would take 1hr per language to adjust totaling $715 additional to the scope on my end. The adjustment I did here would only increase the scope between $65-$130 overall to apply the fix.\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\nLet me know if you have any questions.\u00a0\n\u00a0\nBest,\nDustin\n\u00a0\nDisclaimer\nThe information contained in this communication from the sender is confidential.

We can adjust the\u00a0package to give them scores or try to adapt to their system of distinguishing learners with such limited LMS reporting features. But as shown with our testing, the packages have worked and we'll need their LMS to send us the exact settings that will be needed to accompany Del Monte's method of how they plan to distinguish learners who said Yes or No on the questionnaire.\u00a0\n\u00a0\nPerhaps their system only shows a complete pass/fail scenario? We'd need guidance from their LMS on how scores are captured and if it can distinguish a 50% score that \"fails\" but still passes the course.\u00a0\n\u00a0\nPlease note our so long back and forth comes from their limiting system and as you can notice we are flexible and doing our best to help them get what they need.\nPlease let us know.\nWe are happy to help.\nBest,\nCDS\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\nCatalina De Sanctis\nTranslation Specialist\nLCW\n\u00a0\nWebsite\n\u00a0|\u00a0\nTwitter\n\u00a0|\u00a0\nFacebook\n\u00a0|\u00a0\nLinkedIn\nView our upcoming events\n\u00a0|\u00a0\nSign-up for our newsletter\n\u00a0\nFrom:\n Randi Mooney <rmooney@diligent.com> \nSent:\n Thursday, February 20, 2025 1:49 PM\nTo:\n Catalina De Sanctis <c.desanctis@lcwmail.com>\nCc:\n Brian Luong <bluong@diligent.com>; Don Reyes <dreyes@diligent.com>; Karen Lai <klai@diligent.com>; Kumud Mishra <kmishra@diligent.com>; Jorgelina Venturi <j.venturi@lcwmail.com>\nSubject:\n Re: Diligent - WO_DELMONTE_COC_080624 - Del Monte CoC\n\u00a0\nHello,\n\u00a0\nDel Monte will be following up with their LMS on this matter.

This method involves the least amount of scope increase since we're at the translation phase. See below for what I did to the package to relay to them. Then can use the Menu to skip to the Certification slide to test both clickable decisions.\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\nOn the screen below, when the learner selects the No, the course will complete when the final slide loads. If the learner selects Yes, then the course will register as incomplete when reaching the final slide. \nIf this is not enough for them, please have Del Monte describe how they are going to mitigate this issue for themselves internally with the limitations of their LMS, and we can adjust the package accordingly. \nSince their LMS doesn't allow the reportage they want, they need to decide how they are going to reach out to people who appear incomplete if this isn't good enough. That may even need to include adding language to the course that would then need translation. Reconfiguration/Testing of the course for numerical scores to be sent to signal the selected response in question, would take 1hr per language to adjust totaling $1400 ($140*10lg) additional to the scope on my end. The adjustment I did here would only increase the scope between $140-$280 overall to apply the fix.\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\nPlease let us know your comments.\nThanks!\nCDS\n\u00a0\nCatalina De Sanctis\nTranslation Specialist\nLCW\n\u00a0\nWebsite\n\u00a0| \nTwitter\n\u00a0| \nFacebook\n\u00a0| \nLinkedIn\nView our upcoming events\n\u00a0| \nSign-up for our newsletter\n\u00a0\nFrom:\n\u00a0Randi Mooney <\nrmooney@diligent.com\n>\nSent:\n\u00a0Tuesday, February 11, 2025 2:31 PM\nTo:\n\u00a0Catalina De Sanctis <\nc.desanctis@lcwmail.com\n>\nCc:\n\u00a0Brian Luong <\nbluong@diligent.com\n>; Don Reyes <\ndreyes@diligent.com\n>; Karen Lai <\nklai@diligent.com\n>; Kumud Mishra <\nkmishra@diligent.com\n>\nSubject:\n\u00a0Re: Diligent - WO_DELMONTE_COC_080624 - Del Monte CoC\n\u00a0\nHi Catalina,\n\u00a0\nI wanted to follow up to see if Dustin's new test file for Del Monte is ready?

But in the meantime, sent over an invite for Friday.\n\u00a0\nHere is a summary of the situation:\nDel Monte noted earlier this week that the SCORM 2004 test file worked well in their LMS but followed up asking if we could send them their test report.\nWe informed them that without explicit access to their LMS and metadata, it would not be possible to generate a report on their behalf.\nThey replied that their LMS does not allow for any reports to be exported. This is where the misunderstanding occurred.\nEarlier in the project, it was interpreted that they were not getting the desired information from SCORM 1.2 completion reports. That is why we decided to proceed with SCORM 2004 as it allows for customized reportage.\nWe have asked Del Monte to confirm with their LMS, Convercent, what type of reports or metadata can be generated or exported. Awaiting a response here.\nQuestions to discuss:\nIs there any way to run a report on behalf\u00a0of Del Monte?\nHave reporting capabilities been brought up in the prior year updates for Del Monte? If so, what was the recommendation?\nThanks!\n_________________________\nDiligent\nRandi Mooney (Doran),\n\u00a0she/her\nAdvisory Specialist II, Advisory & Consulting Services\nrmooney@diligent.com\n\u00a0| \ndiligent.com\n\u00a0\nFrom:\n\u00a0Catalina De Sanctis <\nc.desanctis@lcwmail.com\n>\nSent:\n\u00a0Wednesday, January 29, 2025 7:23 PM\nTo:\n\u00a0Randi Mooney <\nrmooney@diligent.com\n>; Brian Luong <\nbluong@diligent.com\n>\nCc:\n\u00a0Don Reyes <\ndreyes@diligent.com\n>; Karen Lai <\nklai@diligent.com\n>; Kumud Mishra <\nkmishra@diligent.com\n>\nSubject:\n\u00a0RE: Diligent - WO_DELMONTE_COC_080624 - Del Monte CoC\n\u00a0\nHello Randi,\nIm sorry, tomorrow is complicated.
