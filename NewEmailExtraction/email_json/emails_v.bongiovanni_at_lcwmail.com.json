To ensure the daily activities of YS, the General Assembly entrusts certain tasks and responsibilities to a small group of people, the executive committee, which we call the Board. The members of the board are chosen by the General Assembly by means of voting.\nThe General Assembly is also meant for discussing other important ongoing issues of importance to YS and its members.\n\u00a0\nAt least once a year a General Assembly meeting is called together by the board in which it renders an account and informs the members of the administrative and financial situation of the association. It does so in the form of a secretarial and financial report of the past year and a policy and financial preview of the coming year. The members can either approve or disapprove of the presented results and future plans.\nAs our valuable members are located across the globe, this is an important time to speak directly to you about our previous year's actions as well as our future plans.\u00a0\nAll members of YS are invited for this meeting and have a right to vote.\nThis event is an important part of any organization and this year we as a board encourage you to join us so your voice will be heard.\nPlease register for this event\u00a0\nhere\n.\nBest regards,\nYoung Sietar\nFollow us on LinkedIn\n\u00a0|\u00a0\nFollow us on\u00a0Instagram\n\u00a0|\u00a0\nFind us on Facebook\nIf you no longer wish to receive these emails you can\u00a0\nunsubscribe\n at any time.",

browser\nEmbracing (more) change and collaboration in 2025!\nAdapting to evolving global challenges together.\nLike fashion, January is out. \nFebruary is in. \nThe month that blinked and was gone. \nIt is already February and we on the Board have so much to update you on. \nRead on to find out more\u2026\n\u00a0\n\u201cTing\u201d: The Global Coaching Secret\nIn Chinese culture, the concept of\u00a0\nTing\n\u00a0(\u807d) encompasses listening with more than just the ears\u2014it involves the eyes, heart, and mind, symbolising focused and holistic attention. \nEffective global coaching, particularly when bridging diverse contexts like the Global North and South, mirrors this approach. Coaches who\u00a0\nTing\n\u00a0are fully present, observing body language, understanding emotional undercurrents, and engaging deeply with coachees. \nMoreover, treating coachees as valued partners\u2014akin to royalty\u2014creates a space of respect and empowerment. \nThis mindful and intentional approach fosters authentic connections and drives transformational growth.\nWe have Jeremy Solomons to thank for his insight on \nTing \n(\u807d)\n, from his recent webinar on Global Coaching (See below). \n\u00a0\nGlobal Coaching webinar with Jeremy Solomons\nHelping us close out the month of January was mentor and dear friend of Young SIETAR, Jeremy Solomons. In his webinar on global coaching, he helped participants better understand the complexities and nuances of coaching in the Global North and the Global South. \nThree Important Takeaways:\nCultural Adaptation Is Essential:\n\u00a0Coaching approaches that work in the Global North may not translate directly to the Global South. Coaches must be adaptable, listening carefully to the cultural and contextual needs of their coachees to foster effective and respectful communication.\nEquity and Empathy Build Stronger Connections:\n\u00a0Understanding the unique challenges faced by individuals in different economic and social contexts requires empathy. Successful coaches create equitable spaces where diverse perspectives are acknowledged and valued.\nThe Importance of Personal Connection:\n\u00a0Building trust and rapport is particularly crucial when coaching in the Global South. Personal connections often form the foundation of successful coaching relationships. Taking time to get to know coachees on a human level, beyond professional objectives, can significantly enhance communication and engagement.\nMembers can access the recording of this webinar and Jeremy\u2019s PDF slides in the members-only section of our website, under Training and Education.\nYoung SIETAR . org\n\u00a0\nUpcoming Events\nWe are working on a few great events free for members.

    "body": "Closing out 2024 - Embracing Authenticity and New Possibilities for 2025!\"\n \nView this email in your browser\nWinter Newsletter\nLet\u2019s welcome sweater weather together!\n\u00a0\nShowing gratitude\nSince we in the global North are now knee-deep in December. For many, this is a time of reflection and gratitude. We are no different here at Young SIETAR. \nFor that reason we would like to thank our \nBoard of Inspiration\n for their continued support of our rag-tag group of young-at-heart interculturalists. We look forward to your continued expertise, guidance, and future collaborations. \n\u00a0\nResearch Reflections on 2024\nAs 2024 comes to an end, the intercultural field celebrates a year of profound growth and collaboration. In a world shaped by VUCA (volatility, uncertainty, complexity, and ambiguity) and the acclerating impact of AI, Young SIETAR members and professionals worldwide have embraced the challenge of deepening intercultural understanding. \nThis year brought forward communication frameworks, including the \nTRIPS Toolkit \nby Dr. Helen Spencer-Oatey, the revitalized \nTOPOI model \nby Dr. Edwin Hoffman, and \nAI-Enhanced Transcultural Communication models\n. These tools remind us of the wisdom at the heart of intercultural work: that empathy, dialogue, and shared humanity remain our most powerful guides. \nAs we reflect on 2024, may we find inspiration in the small yet profound steps that bring cultures closer, envisioning a future defined by connection, curiosity, and mutual respect.\nLike this? \u00a0Read our Research Coordinator`s full reflection on the year on our website.\nWebsite\n*Clicking on the link will take you to our website & require you to log in as a member. \n\u00a0\nPast events\nPersonality. Self-expression. Individuality. Creativity.\nThese were the key themes of the webinar we hosted with Jin Luo, an expert in personal branding and coaching. During the session, titled \nPersonal Branding for Interculturalists\n, Jin shared her journey of self-awareness and how embracing her multifaceted identity became the foundation of her success.\nBeing honest and true to ourselves is the cornerstone of personal branding. Each of us is an individual with multiple dimensions, and we should not limit these to fit into a specific context. Instead, breaking the rules and pushing boundaries allows us to unleash our potential and showcase our unique value.\nHer story was an inspiration for aspiring entrepreneurs. \nThe key takeaway? \nUnleash your creativity and be unapologetically yourself!\n\u00a0\nUpcoming events\nOur board is busy planning events into 2025. \nAs a little teaser, we hope to begin a new series of trainings/ webinars \nThink Intercultural\n \nto help both those new to the intercultural field and seasoned professionals.\nHowever, we hope to also be offering an insightful webinar toward the quiet end of January on \nGlobal Coaching\n. \nOur next \nGeneral Assembly\n (GA) will take place on 2nd, March 2025. During this digital event we will review our accomplishments, projects, research \u00a0and financial outlook from 2024, and our goals for 2025. It is a members-only event.\nFinally, we are beginning to put together a team to plan our next \nTrain-the-Intercultural-Trainer\n \n(TOIT)\n program to take place in late 2025 or early 2026. \nMore information coming soon. \n\u00a0\nLooking for new board members\nThis past spring we welcomed three new volunteer board members to our team. However, many of you know that our board is still incomplete. We are now looking for a new \npresident, secretary, treasurer, and membership coordinator\n.\nThese are some big positions to fill so if you or someone you may know might be interested in any of these positions, we do request a \nCV and inspiration letter\n. \nAdditionally, we also request a period of transition which will include mentoring and management to ensure these positions are a great fit for everyone (the new candidates and the existing board). \nWe will send out a separate email and post across social media about these positions soon.\nDeadline for applications is 1st February, 2025\n.\nPositions will be voted in during our next \nGeneral Assembly in March, 2024. \nTo the blog post\n*Clicking on the link will take you to our website & require you to log in as a member. \n\u00a0\nWant more?\nIf you are already a member go over to our website to read about our upcoming events, view past webinars, learn about key research in the intercultural field, and so much more. \nWe are updating our members only space all the time. \nIf you are not yet a member, please consider becoming one. \nJoin Us\n\u00a0\nAnd finally, before we leave you today our team would like to wish you a happy holiday season, however you celebrate (or not) this time of year. \nyoungsietar.org\nCopyright (C) 2024 Young SIETAR.

If so, jump onto the \nYS member\u2019s-only forum\n (*must log in) and answer these questions and help us create our own seasonal playlist. \nYS General Assembly, 2024\nThe General Assembly is THE OPPORTUNITY for YS members to not only inform themselves of the ongoing business within YS but more importantly to influence the strategy set out by the board, bring in ideas for improvement, discuss issues of importance, etc. \nOn the 26th of June we had our General Assembly (GA). During this all board and member meeting we were able to discuss a number of topics, including: \nour previous years goals and achievements \nour future goals\nbudget\nelecting new board members\nThe General Assembly (GA) is the yearly meeting of the Young SIETAR members, where key issues for the organization are presented, discussed and decided on. It is also a legal requirement to have such a meeting with all members annually.\nAt least once a year a General Assembly meeting is called together by the board in which it renders an account and informs the members of the administrative and financial situation of the association. It does so in the form of a secretarial and financial report of the past year and a policy and financial preview of the coming year. The members can either approve or disapprove of the presented results and future plans.\nThe General Assembly is also meant for discussing other important ongoing issues of importance to YS and its members. There can be more than one General Assembly per year. At the moment however, we hold only one per year. We usually hold the General Assembly during our annual congress. Since we do not have an annual congress this year, we will hold the General Assembly online.\u00a0\nPerhaps most important for you, dear members, is our strategy for the coming year. \nThis includes: \nContinue/restart with online events:\u00a0\nBook Club,\u00a0\nonline webinars,\u00a0\npossible trainings / discussions.\nCall for proposals for new events/projects from members.\nTeambuilding with the new board\u00a0\u00a0\nWith new brainstorm about activities for TOT-Plus\nNew website that is secure\nFinding sponsors for Wild Apricot in the future (or alternatively a new website host)\nWorking on visibility of YS\nSocial media strategy: Linkedin Posts, Facebook \nDo you have any ideas about how we should proceed with any of these points or would you like to share your expertise (or gain experience and knowledge) working on one of these points? Let us know! \nboard@youngsietar.org\nNew Board Members\nWe are truly an international bunch of interculturally curious folks. \nThis past June you voted to have three new board members join our team. \nChelmy Misaki - Training Coordinator\nComi Nguyen - Research Coordinator \nLucrezia D\u2019Amato - Education Coordinator\nClick here to meet the team\nLink will open in a new window and require logging into the YS member site.\nUpcoming training / webinar\nWe are currently working on three new webinars for our members. \nThese should take place over the next few months. \nMore information coming soon. \nIf you would like to share your knowledge with our members, contact us. \nIf you would like to practice sharing your knowledge with our members, contact us. \nIf you know someone outside our membership circle who has knowledge that could benefit our members, contact us! \nboard@youngsietar.org\nLatest on the blog\u2026\nUBUNTU, I AM BECAUSE WE ARE\nIn the heart of Africa, I found a profound lesson in interconnectedness through the spirit of Ubuntu. My 2019 trip to Rwanda unveiled a nation reborn through resilience and community spirit. I explored how Ubuntu, a philosophy of shared humanity and support, continues to shape lives across Africa. From Rwanda\u2019s amazing revival to the rich traditions of other cultures, Ubuntu weaves together nature and human connections in powerful ways. Read the full article to see how these experiences illuminate the powerful bonds that unite us all.\nYS Blog\nLink will open in a new window and require logging into the YS member site.\nA book club suggestion\nPachinko, by MinJin Lee\nPublished February 2017 by Head of Zeus. \nCover art by Tom Hallman\nThis is a call for the YS bookclub, to read the book and share our thoughts by our founder and current Treasurer, Veronique Killian: \nWith the backdrop of the Japanese occupation of Korea, Pachinko follows the lives of a family living in Korea that re-establishes itself in Japan. The narrative progresses through the years and the events of WWII. Even as the story near modern day, its characters are never quite free of their history and the events of the past. As a reader I was invited to love the characters, invited into their thoughts, behavior as if one was looking deeply inside. \nPachinko was a 2017 finalist for the National Book Award for Fiction.\nIn this book one gets a taste of the historic background and intercultural context of the time, and how the book originated to shed light on these intercultural groups. \nMeanwhile, the story has been adapted into a miniseries produced by Apple TV and a documentary about Min Jin Lee was made using both English and Korean languages. \nWho wants to be caught by this book and share together what it brought up? \nboard@youngsietar.org\nOther news\u2026\nIs there something missing here, or you would like to see on the website, in a future webinar, or something else you are curious about researching, learning, or doing? Contact us and perhaps we can inspire or teach each other. \nboard@youngsietar.org\nCopyright (C) 2024 Young SIETAR.

Your Scoro site \nlcw.scoro.com\n has been updated!\nWe're bringing you a few small but useful usability improvements in the project view this month, from task sorting to updated calculation logic in the budget charts. Consider it a little summer maintenance as we prepare for some bigger updates coming your way. \nSee what we\u2019ve been up to!\nTask sorting in the project view\nNow you can \nsort the tasks in the project view\n based on your preferred criteria to find the relevant tasks faster. Simply \nclick on the respective column name\n. If the project has phases, the tasks are sorted accordingly within each phase. Scoro will remember your sorting preference and apply it across all projects. \nRead more\n \nBudget chart improvements\nWe've improved the accuracy of the budget tracking in the budget charts under \nBudget > Budget health\n in the project detailed view. \nPlanned tasks are now reflected in the forecast even if they don't have set due dates\n. In such cases, the project end date is used instead to distribute the task value across the future timeline. This helps to keep the forecast accurate from early on. You can understand the budget burn based on planned work even if all tasks don't have a proper due date yet. \nRead more\n \nThe Handbook Podcast & Newsletter\nDid you know we also have a podcast? Join \nHarv Nagra\n, an Ops Consultant and Ex-Agency Leader, on our podcast \nThe Handbook\n, , as he dives into engaging conversations with operations experts to discuss the behind-the-scenes of agency operations and explore the latest trends and innovations.

Give us a few days to get the links created. Juri can work with our internal team and provide a timing update on that.\n\u00a0\nRegarding the survey, we typically do this upon request with clients. As you remember, we did it for the last program. There are some things to consider:\n-What are you trying to measure \u2013 comprehension of concepts learned? Change in attitude? Change in behavior? The questions would have to be tailored accordingly\n\u00a0\n**I recall when we discussed measurements for a survey last time we said change would not make sense as we don\u2019t anticipate change just from a one-time session.\u00a0 We decided comprehension of concepts, a before and after to gage if anything was learned. \u00a0I was looking for your thoughts on which concepts / learned behavior you believe attendees can grasp from the workshop without putting into practice yet but that would help modify behavior once applied.\n\u00a0\n-How will you use the data? This will need to be specified in the survey instructions so that people know when they are responding how their answers will be used\n\u00a0\n**The data would be used to access the understanding of the content of the workshop and perhaps where we need to emphasize with a future learning opportunity.\u00a0 \n\u00a0\n-What platform will you use? When we did this last time, we used LCW\u2019s survey monkey account\n\u00a0\n**We can use Microsoft Forms.\u00a0 \u00a0\n\u00a0\n-How will the link be sent out? Will we use the communications we are already working on or will there be additional communications needed?\n\u00a0\n**The link for the survey will be sent out via email for registration. \n\u00a0\nIn our last engagement, the survey was included as an additional (paid) deliverable. As an alternative, since I know you don\u2019t have any additional budget, what we could do is advise you on the questions to ask but have GroupM run the survey internally. I\u2019m happy to be a thought partner in designing questions for you to use.\n\u00a0\n**This would be helpful based on your expertise a well as experience across some of your other clients.\n\u00a0\nRegarding the communications, thank you for sending over the example, it aligns with what I remember. We have the created the attached, which has all the information about the courses (description, learning objectives). Of course, for the invitation piece, we have details to fill in (the zoom links, notably!). Let us know if you need any other support on this!\n\u00a0\nThank you,\nSarah \n\u00a0\nFrom:\n Lukeisha Paul <\nLukeisha.Paul@groupm.com\n> \nSent:\n Monday, August 12, 2024 12:32 PM\nTo:\n Sarah Nodarse <\ns.nodarse@lcwmail.com\n>; Juri Mansour <\nj.mansour@lcwmail.com\n>\nCc:\n Safa Aamir <\nsafa.aamir@groupm.com\n>; Shelton Rankin <\nshelton.rankin@groupm.com\n>; Brian Dashew <\nbrian.dashew@groupm.com\n>\nSubject:\n LCW - FW: Action Required: Managing Bias in the Workplace Registration\n\u00a0\nHi Juri and Sarah,\n\u00a0\nThis is where we would need a system for people to register.\u00a0 We\u2019ll need the zoom links that we can share for the sessions as well as login information for Zoom.\u00a0 \u00a0I was also wondering if we could do a pre/post survey for a measurement of understanding/learning. \u00a0I mentioned this in the meeting.

I am interested and I\u2019m a mandarin speaking trainer. Will the materials be translated and delivered in Mandarin? \n\u00a0\nA couple of questions: \nFinished reading the deck, I\u2019m not very clear what we would like to achieve by this training. Understand it\u2019s a training for working inclusively and it\u2019s still being developed. \nA few things that I\u2019d like to see included in the discussion: \nBenefit of DEI programs. Yes, it\u2019s important to implement DEI programs. But they are not show and tells, there are real benefits from a diverse work force. I am a business owner, I would not hire just because I need to fulfill the DEI quota. It is because the different viewpoints and diverse background and experience the new hires will bring in. \nDistinction of Stereotype vs individuals. Media portrayal vs. reality. Why we should not assume when working with people from diverse background. \u00a0\nThe enslaved African in ancient Chinese history is an interesting trivia. But it has nothing to do with how Chinese treat or view Africans or African Americans today. It could easily be dismissed as a discussion topic since Chinese would say that that happened centuries ago, it is irrelevant today since we don\u2019t have slavery any more. It goes back to my point b on where the stereotype comes from. How have that affected our perception. \n\u00a0\nJust my two cents. Thanks! \n\u00a0\nBest regards, \n\u00a0\nZ.J.
