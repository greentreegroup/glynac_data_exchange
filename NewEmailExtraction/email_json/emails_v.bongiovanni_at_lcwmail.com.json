season, Young SIETAR is also embracing fresh beginnings! We are thrilled to welcome two new board members, including our new\u00a0\nPresident\n\u00a0and\u00a0\nMembership Coordinator\n, who bring passion and energy to our growing community. \nThis spring also marks the launch of\u00a0\nThink Intercultural\n, our new webinar series designed to spark insightful conversations on intercultural topics. We\u2019ve already kicked off with an inspiring session on intercultural relationships with Brazilian author\u00a0\nLiliana Tinoco B\u00e4ckert\n, and more recently with\u00a0\nDr. Catherine (Peyrols) Wu\n, who guided us through practical frameworks for unlocking intercultural intelligence.

As we begin this new chapter together, I want to share my vision, goals, and hopes for the future of our vibrant community.\nYoung SIETAR is more than just a network\u2014it\u2019s a platform for young professionals passionate about international trade, innovation, and cross-cultural collaboration. It\u2019s a space where future leaders connect, learn, and grow. And now, more than ever, I believe in the power of\u00a0\ncommunity\n\u00a0to spark real change.\nMy Vision: A Dynamic, Inclusive, and Global Community\nI envision Young SIETAR as a thriving hub where fresh ideas meet experience and diverse backgrounds fuel innovation. I want us to be known as a professional network and a\u00a0\nmovement\n\u00a0that inspires young people to be bold, curious, and globally minded.\nI aim to ensure that every member, whether attending their first event or leading a project, feels seen, heard, and empowered.\nGoals for 2025 and Beyond\n1.\u00a0\nMake YS More Accessible and Visible\nWe\u2019ll increase our presence on platforms like LinkedIn and Instagram to showcase our events and highlight member stories, achievements, and cross-border collaborations.\n2.\u00a0\nCreate Meaningful Events\nFrom thought-provoking panels to hands-on workshops, I want our events to offer more than just networking\u2014they should provide real value, practical knowledge, and memorable experiences.\n3.\u00a0\nPromote Diversity and Inclusion\nOur strength lies in our diversity. I aim to spotlight voices from all backgrounds, especially those navigating international careers, and build bridges between industries, cultures, and generations.\n4.\u00a0\nEncourage Mentorship and Peer Support\nI\u2019d love to foster more mentorship opportunities within YS\u2014whether through formal programs or informal connections. We grow faster when we grow together.\n5.\u00a0\nBuild Stronger Bridges with SIETAR and Beyond\nStrengthening our collaboration with SIETAR and other international networks will open doors for our members, especially in policy discussions, trade missions, and intercultural projects.\nA Collaborative Future\nWhile I bring ideas and energy to the role, I know that real impact comes from collaboration. This is\u00a0\nour\n\u00a0community, and I invite you to help shape it. Whether you\u2019re full of ideas or just looking for your place here, there\u2019s room for you\u2014and your voice matters.\nLet\u2019s build something bold, inclusive, and truly global. Here\u2019s to new beginnings and exciting opportunities!\n\u00a0\nWebinar Highlights: \nHow to Use Culture as a Catalyst for Change with Mithun Mridha\nIn this engaging session, Mithun Mridha explored the profound role of culture in driving meaningful transformation across personal, organizational, and societal levels. Drawing from real-world examples, he emphasized that culture is not a static entity but a dynamic force that can be leveraged to foster innovation, inclusivity, and progress.\nKey Highlights:\nCulture as a Living System\n: Mridha discussed how culture evolves and influences behaviors, attitudes, and values, making it a crucial factor in implementing change.\nIntercultural Competence\n: He highlighted the importance of developing intercultural skills to navigate and adapt to diverse environments effectively.\nChange Through Narrative\n: Storytelling was presented as a powerful tool to shape cultural perceptions and create buy-in for new ideas.\nChallenges & Resistance\n: The discussion addressed common barriers to cultural transformation, such as deep-rooted biases and resistance to change.\nPractical Applications\n: Attendees learned actionable strategies for using culture to drive positive change in workplaces, communities, and beyond.\n\u00a0\nThink Intercultural Webinar Series\n\u00a0\nIntercultural Relationships \nwith Liliana Tinoco B\u00e4ckert\nCultural Intelligence: A Practical Framework for Intercultural Training\nIn March, \nLiliana Tinoco\u00a0\nB\u00e4ckert shared the wisdom she gained\u00a0interviewing \n35 profiles of intercultural couples, exploring the challenges and nuances of intercultural relationships with the YS community. While this wisdom is compiled in her book,\n\"Amores Internacionais: Casei com um Estrangeiro, e Agora?\"\n\u00a0\n\u00a0(\"International Loves: I Married a Foreigner, Now What?\")\n\u00a0it is currently only available in Portuguese. \nHowever, based on the reception B\u00e4ckert experienced and the feedback YS received, this is an important and poignant topic in our community. \u00a0It is clear that interest and curiosity on this topic will only increase as our working and personal world become ever more international. \nThe main take-away from this webinar: it is the small details that shape these relationships and continued open communication is paramount. \u00a0\nThanks to the interest and popularity of this topic it is possible the YS community will return to this topic.\u00a0\nWe were thrilled to host our webinar,\u00a0\n\"Unlocking Intercultural Intelligence: A Practical Framework for Intercultural Training,\"\n\u00a0featuring Dr. Catherine (Peyrols) Wu on April 1st.\nDr. Wu shared her extensive expertise in intercultural communication and training, providing participants with actionable strategies to enhance their intercultural competence. Whether attendees were seasoned professionals or new to the field, they gained valuable insights into navigating cultural complexities with confidence.\nThis wonderful event sparked engaging discussions and equipped participants with practical frameworks to apply in both personal and professional settings.\nThank you to everyone who joined us for this enriching session!

The members of the board are chosen by the General Assembly by means of voting.\nThe General Assembly is also meant for discussing other important ongoing issues of importance to YS and its members.\n\u00a0\nAt least once a year a General Assembly meeting is called together by the board in which it renders an account and informs the members of the administrative and financial situation of the association. It does so in the form of a secretarial and financial report of the past year and a policy and financial preview of the coming year. The members can either approve or disapprove of the presented results and future plans.\nAs our valuable members are located across the globe, this is an important time to speak directly to you about our previous year's actions as well as our future plans.\u00a0\nAll members of YS are invited for this meeting and have a right to vote.\nThis event is an important part of any organization and this year we as a board encourage you to join us so your voice will be heard.\nPlease register for this event\u00a0\nhere\n.\nBest regards,\nYoung Sietar\nFollow us on LinkedIn\n\u00a0|\u00a0\nFollow us on\u00a0Instagram\n\u00a0|\u00a0\nFind us on Facebook\nIf you no longer wish to receive these emails you can\u00a0\nunsubscribe\n at any time.",

browser\nEmbracing (more) change and collaboration in 2025!\nAdapting to evolving global challenges together.\nLike fashion, January is out. \nFebruary is in. \nThe month that blinked and was gone. \nIt is already February and we on the Board have so much to update you on. \nRead on to find out more\u2026\n\u00a0\n\u201cTing\u201d: The Global Coaching Secret\nIn Chinese culture, the concept of\u00a0\nTing\n\u00a0(\u807d) encompasses listening with more than just the ears\u2014it involves the eyes, heart, and mind, symbolising focused and holistic attention. \nEffective global coaching, particularly when bridging diverse contexts like the Global North and South, mirrors this approach. Coaches who\u00a0\nTing\n\u00a0are fully present, observing body language, understanding emotional undercurrents, and engaging deeply with coachees. \nMoreover, treating coachees as valued partners\u2014akin to royalty\u2014creates a space of respect and empowerment. \nThis mindful and intentional approach fosters authentic connections and drives transformational growth.\nWe have Jeremy Solomons to thank for his insight on \nTing \n(\u807d)\n, from his recent webinar on Global Coaching (See below). \n\u00a0\nGlobal Coaching webinar with Jeremy Solomons\nHelping us close out the month of January was mentor and dear friend of Young SIETAR, Jeremy Solomons. In his webinar on global coaching, he helped participants better understand the complexities and nuances of coaching in the Global North and the Global South. \nThree Important Takeaways:\nCultural Adaptation Is Essential:\n\u00a0Coaching approaches that work in the Global North may not translate directly to the Global South. Coaches must be adaptable, listening carefully to the cultural and contextual needs of their coachees to foster effective and respectful communication.\nEquity and Empathy Build Stronger Connections:\n\u00a0Understanding the unique challenges faced by individuals in different economic and social contexts requires empathy. Successful coaches create equitable spaces where diverse perspectives are acknowledged and valued.\nThe Importance of Personal Connection:\n\u00a0Building trust and rapport is particularly crucial when coaching in the Global South. Personal connections often form the foundation of successful coaching relationships. Taking time to get to know coachees on a human level, beyond professional objectives, can significantly enhance communication and engagement.\nMembers can access the recording of this webinar and Jeremy\u2019s PDF slides in the members-only section of our website, under Training and Education.\nYoung SIETAR . org\n\u00a0\nUpcoming Events\nWe are working on a few great events free for members.

    "body": "Closing out 2024 - Embracing Authenticity and New Possibilities for 2025!\"\n \nView this email in your browser\nWinter Newsletter\nLet\u2019s welcome sweater weather together!\n\u00a0\nShowing gratitude\nSince we in the global North are now knee-deep in December. For many, this is a time of reflection and gratitude. We are no different here at Young SIETAR. \nFor that reason we would like to thank our \nBoard of Inspiration\n for their continued support of our rag-tag group of young-at-heart interculturalists. We look forward to your continued expertise, guidance, and future collaborations. \n\u00a0\nResearch Reflections on 2024\nAs 2024 comes to an end, the intercultural field celebrates a year of profound growth and collaboration. In a world shaped by VUCA (volatility, uncertainty, complexity, and ambiguity) and the acclerating impact of AI, Young SIETAR members and professionals worldwide have embraced the challenge of deepening intercultural understanding. \nThis year brought forward communication frameworks, including the \nTRIPS Toolkit \nby Dr. Helen Spencer-Oatey, the revitalized \nTOPOI model \nby Dr. Edwin Hoffman, and \nAI-Enhanced Transcultural Communication models\n. These tools remind us of the wisdom at the heart of intercultural work: that empathy, dialogue, and shared humanity remain our most powerful guides. \nAs we reflect on 2024, may we find inspiration in the small yet profound steps that bring cultures closer, envisioning a future defined by connection, curiosity, and mutual respect.\nLike this? \u00a0Read our Research Coordinator`s full reflection on the year on our website.\nWebsite\n*Clicking on the link will take you to our website & require you to log in as a member. \n\u00a0\nPast events\nPersonality. Self-expression. Individuality. Creativity.\nThese were the key themes of the webinar we hosted with Jin Luo, an expert in personal branding and coaching. During the session, titled \nPersonal Branding for Interculturalists\n, Jin shared her journey of self-awareness and how embracing her multifaceted identity became the foundation of her success.\nBeing honest and true to ourselves is the cornerstone of personal branding. Each of us is an individual with multiple dimensions, and we should not limit these to fit into a specific context. Instead, breaking the rules and pushing boundaries allows us to unleash our potential and showcase our unique value.\nHer story was an inspiration for aspiring entrepreneurs. \nThe key takeaway? \nUnleash your creativity and be unapologetically yourself!\n\u00a0\nUpcoming events\nOur board is busy planning events into 2025. \nAs a little teaser, we hope to begin a new series of trainings/ webinars \nThink Intercultural\n \nto help both those new to the intercultural field and seasoned professionals.\nHowever, we hope to also be offering an insightful webinar toward the quiet end of January on \nGlobal Coaching\n. \nOur next \nGeneral Assembly\n (GA) will take place on 2nd, March 2025. During this digital event we will review our accomplishments, projects, research \u00a0and financial outlook from 2024, and our goals for 2025. It is a members-only event.\nFinally, we are beginning to put together a team to plan our next \nTrain-the-Intercultural-Trainer\n \n(TOIT)\n program to take place in late 2025 or early 2026. \nMore information coming soon. \n\u00a0\nLooking for new board members\nThis past spring we welcomed three new volunteer board members to our team. However, many of you know that our board is still incomplete. We are now looking for a new \npresident, secretary, treasurer, and membership coordinator\n.\nThese are some big positions to fill so if you or someone you may know might be interested in any of these positions, we do request a \nCV and inspiration letter\n. \nAdditionally, we also request a period of transition which will include mentoring and management to ensure these positions are a great fit for everyone (the new candidates and the existing board). \nWe will send out a separate email and post across social media about these positions soon.\nDeadline for applications is 1st February, 2025\n.\nPositions will be voted in during our next \nGeneral Assembly in March, 2024. \nTo the blog post\n*Clicking on the link will take you to our website & require you to log in as a member. \n\u00a0\nWant more?\nIf you are already a member go over to our website to read about our upcoming events, view past webinars, learn about key research in the intercultural field, and so much more. \nWe are updating our members only space all the time. \nIf you are not yet a member, please consider becoming one. \nJoin Us\n\u00a0\nAnd finally, before we leave you today our team would like to wish you a happy holiday season, however you celebrate (or not) this time of year. \nyoungsietar.org\nCopyright (C) 2024 Young SIETAR.

    "body": "Summer time, summer time, summer time sadness - or - are you ready in your Autumn sweater?\n \nView this email in your browser\nGreetings Young SIETARians, \nWe on the board hope all of you wonderful members have had a great summer, if you are in the northern hemisphere, or winter, if you live in the Southern hemisphere. We all took the month of August off, but are back now to share some great news!\nRead on to find out more\u2026\nBut first, a question to you as we transition to a new season: are you the type to mourn this season\u2019s end or revel in the idea of change - hence the two song lyrics in our newsletter \u2018description\u2019. Do you know which songs they are from? If so, jump onto the \nYS member\u2019s-only forum\n (*must log in) and answer these questions and help us create our own seasonal playlist. \nYS General Assembly, 2024\nThe General Assembly is THE OPPORTUNITY for YS members to not only inform themselves of the ongoing business within YS but more importantly to influence the strategy set out by the board, bring in ideas for improvement, discuss issues of importance, etc. \nOn the 26th of June we had our General Assembly (GA). During this all board and member meeting we were able to discuss a number of topics, including: \nour previous years goals and achievements \nour future goals\nbudget\nelecting new board members\nThe General Assembly (GA) is the yearly meeting of the Young SIETAR members, where key issues for the organization are presented, discussed and decided on. It is also a legal requirement to have such a meeting with all members annually.\nAt least once a year a General Assembly meeting is called together by the board in which it renders an account and informs the members of the administrative and financial situation of the association. It does so in the form of a secretarial and financial report of the past year and a policy and financial preview of the coming year. The members can either approve or disapprove of the presented results and future plans.\nThe General Assembly is also meant for discussing other important ongoing issues of importance to YS and its members. There can be more than one General Assembly per year. At the moment however, we hold only one per year. We usually hold the General Assembly during our annual congress. Since we do not have an annual congress this year, we will hold the General Assembly online.\u00a0\nPerhaps most important for you, dear members, is our strategy for the coming year. \nThis includes: \nContinue/restart with online events:\u00a0\nBook Club,\u00a0\nonline webinars,\u00a0\npossible trainings / discussions.\nCall for proposals for new events/projects from members.\nTeambuilding with the new board\u00a0\u00a0\nWith new brainstorm about activities for TOT-Plus\nNew website that is secure\nFinding sponsors for Wild Apricot in the future (or alternatively a new website host)\nWorking on visibility of YS\nSocial media strategy: Linkedin Posts, Facebook \nDo you have any ideas about how we should proceed with any of these points or would you like to share your expertise (or gain experience and knowledge) working on one of these points? Let us know! \nboard@youngsietar.org\nNew Board Members\nWe are truly an international bunch of interculturally curious folks. \nThis past June you voted to have three new board members join our team. \nChelmy Misaki - Training Coordinator\nComi Nguyen - Research Coordinator \nLucrezia D\u2019Amato - Education Coordinator\nClick here to meet the team\nLink will open in a new window and require logging into the YS member site.\nUpcoming training / webinar\nWe are currently working on three new webinars for our members. \nThese should take place over the next few months. \nMore information coming soon. \nIf you would like to share your knowledge with our members, contact us. \nIf you would like to practice sharing your knowledge with our members, contact us. \nIf you know someone outside our membership circle who has knowledge that could benefit our members, contact us! \nboard@youngsietar.org\nLatest on the blog\u2026\nUBUNTU, I AM BECAUSE WE ARE\nIn the heart of Africa, I found a profound lesson in interconnectedness through the spirit of Ubuntu. My 2019 trip to Rwanda unveiled a nation reborn through resilience and community spirit. I explored how Ubuntu, a philosophy of shared humanity and support, continues to shape lives across Africa. From Rwanda\u2019s amazing revival to the rich traditions of other cultures, Ubuntu weaves together nature and human connections in powerful ways. Read the full article to see how these experiences illuminate the powerful bonds that unite us all.\nYS Blog\nLink will open in a new window and require logging into the YS member site.\nA book club suggestion\nPachinko, by MinJin Lee\nPublished February 2017 by Head of Zeus. \nCover art by Tom Hallman\nThis is a call for the YS bookclub, to read the book and share our thoughts by our founder and current Treasurer, Veronique Killian: \nWith the backdrop of the Japanese occupation of Korea, Pachinko follows the lives of a family living in Korea that re-establishes itself in Japan. The narrative progresses through the years and the events of WWII. Even as the story near modern day, its characters are never quite free of their history and the events of the past. As a reader I was invited to love the characters, invited into their thoughts, behavior as if one was looking deeply inside. \nPachinko was a 2017 finalist for the National Book Award for Fiction.\nIn this book one gets a taste of the historic background and intercultural context of the time, and how the book originated to shed light on these intercultural groups. \nMeanwhile, the story has been adapted into a miniseries produced by Apple TV and a documentary about Min Jin Lee was made using both English and Korean languages. \nWho wants to be caught by this book and share together what it brought up? \nboard@youngsietar.org\nOther news\u2026\nIs there something missing here, or you would like to see on the website, in a future webinar, or something else you are curious about researching, learning, or doing? Contact us and perhaps we can inspire or teach each other. \nboard@youngsietar.org\nCopyright (C) 2024 Young SIETAR.

Your Scoro site \nlcw.scoro.com\n has been updated!\nWe're bringing you a few small but useful usability improvements in the project view this month, from task sorting to updated calculation logic in the budget charts. Consider it a little summer maintenance as we prepare for some bigger updates coming your way. \nSee what we\u2019ve been up to!\nTask sorting in the project view\nNow you can \nsort the tasks in the project view\n based on your preferred criteria to find the relevant tasks faster. Simply \nclick on the respective column name\n. If the project has phases, the tasks are sorted accordingly within each phase. Scoro will remember your sorting preference and apply it across all projects. \nRead more\n \nBudget chart improvements\nWe've improved the accuracy of the budget tracking in the budget charts under \nBudget > Budget health\n in the project detailed view. \nPlanned tasks are now reflected in the forecast even if they don't have set due dates\n. In such cases, the project end date is used instead to distribute the task value across the future timeline. This helps to keep the forecast accurate from early on. You can understand the budget burn based on planned work even if all tasks don't have a proper due date yet. \nRead more\n \nThe Handbook Podcast & Newsletter\nDid you know we also have a podcast?

Give us a few days to get the links created. Juri can work with our internal team and provide a timing update on that.\n\u00a0\nRegarding the survey, we typically do this upon request with clients. As you remember, we did it for the last program. There are some things to consider:\n-What are you trying to measure \u2013 comprehension of concepts learned? Change in attitude? Change in behavior? The questions would have to be tailored accordingly\n\u00a0\n**I recall when we discussed measurements for a survey last time we said change would not make sense as we don\u2019t anticipate change just from a one-time session.\u00a0 We decided comprehension of concepts, a before and after to gage if anything was learned. \u00a0I was looking for your thoughts on which concepts / learned behavior you believe attendees can grasp from the workshop without putting into practice yet but that would help modify behavior once applied.\n\u00a0\n-How will you use the data? This will need to be specified in the survey instructions so that people know when they are responding how their answers will be used\n\u00a0\n**The data would be used to access the understanding of the content of the workshop and perhaps where we need to emphasize with a future learning opportunity.\u00a0 \n\u00a0\n-What platform will you use? When we did this last time, we used LCW\u2019s survey monkey account\n\u00a0\n**We can use Microsoft Forms.\u00a0 \u00a0\n\u00a0\n-How will the link be sent out? Will we use the communications we are already working on or will there be additional communications needed?\n\u00a0\n**The link for the survey will be sent out via email for registration. \n\u00a0\nIn our last engagement, the survey was included as an additional (paid) deliverable. As an alternative, since I know you don\u2019t have any additional budget, what we could do is advise you on the questions to ask but have GroupM run the survey internally. I\u2019m happy to be a thought partner in designing questions for you to use.\n\u00a0\n**This would be helpful based on your expertise a well as experience across some of your other clients.\n\u00a0\nRegarding the communications, thank you for sending over the example, it aligns with what I remember. We have the created the attached, which has all the information about the courses (description, learning objectives). Of course, for the invitation piece, we have details to fill in (the zoom links, notably!). Let us know if you need any other support on this!\n\u00a0\nThank you,\nSarah \n\u00a0\nFrom:\n Lukeisha Paul <\nLukeisha.Paul@groupm.com\n> \nSent:\n Monday, August 12, 2024 12:32 PM\nTo:\n Sarah Nodarse <\ns.nodarse@lcwmail.com\n>; Juri Mansour <\nj.mansour@lcwmail.com\n>\nCc:\n Safa Aamir <\nsafa.aamir@groupm.com\n>; Shelton Rankin <\nshelton.rankin@groupm.com\n>; Brian Dashew <\nbrian.dashew@groupm.com\n>\nSubject:\n LCW - FW: Action Required: Managing Bias in the Workplace Registration\n\u00a0\nHi Juri and Sarah,\n\u00a0\nThis is where we would need a system for people to register.\u00a0 We\u2019ll need the zoom links that we can share for the sessions as well as login information for Zoom.\u00a0 \u00a0I was also wondering if we could do a pre/post survey for a measurement of understanding/learning. \u00a0I mentioned this in the meeting.

I am interested and I\u2019m a mandarin speaking trainer. Will the materials be translated and delivered in Mandarin? \n\u00a0\nA couple of questions: \nFinished reading the deck, I\u2019m not very clear what we would like to achieve by this training. Understand it\u2019s a training for working inclusively and it\u2019s still being developed. \nA few things that I\u2019d like to see included in the discussion: \nBenefit of DEI programs. Yes, it\u2019s important to implement DEI programs. But they are not show and tells, there are real benefits from a diverse work force. I am a business owner, I would not hire just because I need to fulfill the DEI quota. It is because the different viewpoints and diverse background and experience the new hires will bring in. \nDistinction of Stereotype vs individuals. Media portrayal vs. reality. Why we should not assume when working with people from diverse background. \u00a0\nThe enslaved African in ancient Chinese history is an interesting trivia. But it has nothing to do with how Chinese treat or view Africans or African Americans today. It could easily be dismissed as a discussion topic since Chinese would say that that happened centuries ago, it is irrelevant today since we don\u2019t have slavery any more. It goes back to my point b on where the stereotype comes from. How have that affected our perception. \n\u00a0\nJust my two cents. Thanks! \n\u00a0\nBest regards, \n\u00a0\nZ.J.

I have some questions, as the final deck is due next Thu.\n\u00a0\nOne of the quiz questions you gave us doesn\u2019t have a source \u2013 \u201cTrue/False: Differences in caste typically produce minimal differences in quality of life.\u201d The speaker notes says \u201c\nThe research journal Science studied this issue recently in detail.\u00a0 Being upper caste offers a clear advantage in being better off, and has shown that it is an even bigger advantage than expected.\u00a0 Caste inequality seriously and negatively affects the lives of many people from lower caste groups in countries such as India.\n\u201d Do you have a link to the source to this? \n\u00a0\nFully understanding that Asia is a collections of almost 50 distinct countries\u2026\u2026.\u00a0 Could you possibly share any issues or events that people have been talking about lately in the DEI/intercultural/HR world in Asia (in particular, China, Japan, Korea, Singapore, Malaysia) that touch on:\nAnti-Blackness and colorism\nBias against minority ethnic groups (different in each country)\nCaste as a form of racialization\nClassism\nDeficit of women leaders, gender bias against women \n\u00a0\nWe\u2019d like to show we\u2019re up to speed on relevant topics and the deck is due next Thursday. We\u2019d like to put up some headlines and recent data/charts on a couple of the slides. \n\u00a0\nWe\u2019d like to have a couple of slides focus solely on women, so what would you say are the top 3 issues that leaders should be paying attention to or addressing when it comes to women in Asia? Are they similar to US in some ways? Here are some that we often bring up here:\nDouble bind: Too masculine to be likeable, too feminine to be competent or respected, Penalty for deviating from female stereotypes\n\u201cBroken rung\u201d at the first step up to manager Motherhood penalty\nLower quality feedback\nImportance given to appearance and image\nMicroaggressions\nPay gap \nMen mentoring and sponsoring other men\nGendered networks\n\u00a0\nFinally, I see this slide (below) and was wondering, was this meant to be a focus on India re: colorism? Did you design this activity or did we? I know colorism exists throughout Asia\u2026. \n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\nTHANK YOU!!\n\u00a0\nRebecca M.

Adriana, Jas, and Brian, thank you for the hard work you put into giving us such great content, and Eileen thank you for your work integrating it all into the drafts we shared with the client.\n\u00a0\nOverall, the client is pleased with the results so far. We have reviewed each version with them, and gotten specific feedback for each region. For example, we decided to remove the section about the Black experience in the US from the APAC deck and we decided to keep the Jane Eliot material in all the decks. We are now working on finalizing each version in turn, starting with APAC. \nWe are delivering the final versions this month, starting with APAC on August 8, LATAM 8-15, and Canada 8-22.\n\u00a0\nAs we finalize each version, we will likely reach out to each of you in turn (Brian, Adriana, Jas) with questions or clarification requests. Eileen, we are likely not going to need you to do more on this, as Rebecca and I will take over the integration and finalization work. However, we may have quick questions for you as well. \n\u00a0\nBrian, Adriana, Jas \u2013 no action required at the moment, but you can expect a few follow up questions from Rebecca and I (Brian, you\u2019re up first in the timeline!) coming soon.\n\u00a0\nThanks again \u2013 you have helped to make one of our star clients happy!\n\u00a0\nPS do let me know if you have any issues with invoicing and payment!\n\u00a0\nSarah\n\u00a0\nSarah Nodarse\n(she/her)\nPrincipal Consultant\nLCW\n4753 N Broadway, Flr. 2\nChicago, IL 60640\n\u00a0\n773-828-6781 (office)\n773-474-9138 (direct)\ns.nodarse@lcwmail.com\n\u00a0\nWebsite | Twitter | Facebook | LinkedIn\nView our upcoming events | Sign-up for our newsletter\n\u00a0\nI live and work in Chicago, IL \u2013 on the unceded territory of the Pokagon band of Potawatomi.

I am interested and I\u2019m a mandarin speaking trainer. Will the materials be translated and delivered in Mandarin? \n\u00a0\nA couple of questions: \nFinished reading the deck, I\u2019m not very clear what we would like to achieve by this training. Understand it\u2019s a training for working inclusively and it\u2019s still being developed. \nA few things that I\u2019d like to see included in the discussion: \nBenefit of DEI programs. Yes, it\u2019s important to implement DEI programs. But they are not show and tells, there are real benefits from a diverse work force. I am a business owner, I would not hire just because I need to fulfill the DEI quota. It is because the different viewpoints and diverse background and experience the new hires will bring in. \nDistinction of Stereotype vs individuals. Media portrayal vs. reality. Why we should not assume when working with people from diverse background. \u00a0\nThe enslaved African in ancient Chinese history is an interesting trivia. But it has nothing to do with how Chinese treat or view Africans or African Americans today.

I am interested and I\u2019m a mandarin speaking trainer. Will the materials be translated and delivered in Mandarin? \n\u00a0\nA couple of questions: \nFinished reading the deck, I\u2019m not very clear what we would like to achieve by this training. Understand it\u2019s a training for working inclusively and it\u2019s still being developed. \nA few things that I\u2019d like to see included in the discussion: \nBenefit of DEI programs. Yes, it\u2019s important to implement DEI programs. But they are not show and tells, there are real benefits from a diverse work force. I am a business owner, I would not hire just because I need to fulfill the DEI quota. It is because the different viewpoints and diverse background and experience the new hires will bring in. \nDistinction of Stereotype vs individuals. Media portrayal vs. reality. Why we should not assume when working with people from diverse background. \u00a0\nThe enslaved African in ancient Chinese history is an interesting trivia. But it has nothing to do with how Chinese treat or view Africans or African Americans today. It could easily be dismissed as a discussion topic since Chinese would say that that happened centuries ago, it is irrelevant today since we don\u2019t have slavery any more. It goes back to my point b on where the stereotype comes from. How have that affected our perception. \n\u00a0\nJust my two cents. Thanks! \n\u00a0\nBest regards, \n\u00a0\nZ.J.

Thank you!\n\u00a0\nFrom:\n Rebecca Parrilla <r.parrilla@lcwmail.com> \nSent:\n Tuesday, July 30, 2024 5:09 PM\nTo:\n Sarah Nodarse <s.nodarse@lcwmail.com>\nSubject:\n UPDATE: BSC APAC LI Deck\nImportance:\n High\n\u00a0\nHI there, \nI\u2019ve tweaked things in a few places already, based on our discussion today, and I created our list of things \u2018to do\u2019. Yellow means you, blue means me. Here it is and it\u2019s also in the Word doc in the folder:\n\u00a0\nThroughout:\nIncluding slide 1: Replace images with diverse APAC images (BSC is in Singapore, Malaysia, Japan, India, China (SH and HK), Taiwan, S. Korea, Philippines, Vietnam, Indonesia) \n- Keri\nReplace \u2018multicultural\u2019 with \u2018historically excluded\u2019 \u2013 \nI think this one is done\nEnsure the language is not too technical or sophisticated (to allow for NNES) \u2013 \nlet\u2019s both work on this one?\n \nEnsure there is interactivity throughout\nEnsure timing works out to 3 hours\u2013\nRP to time it out now, to see where we are\nSlides 3 and 4 BSC DEI Commitment and Setting the Stage\n: Update and ensure text is not too small. Maybe combine slides 3-4\nSlide 15 Quiz:\n Revamp quiz, include robust speaker notes (further instructions in blue highlight on the slide)\nSlide 16 post-poll debrief \u201cWhy leading inclusively is important in APAC\u201d\n: Do research around these points, add images and/or headlines, revamp speaker notes (can we insert some interactivity here? Does not have to be a single slide)\nSlide 17 Gender info/examples:\n Research APAC gender data/examples (dearth of women in leadership, what are other common issues?), include images and/or headlines, write speaker notes \nSlide 18: Video-Focus on class/socioeconomic background\n (slide title will change): figure out edits, ask Dustin to download and edit, write out speaker notes\nSlide 19: Video \u2013 The complexity of being mixed race:\n figure out edits, ask Dustin to download and edit, write out speaker notes\nSlides 20-21 (Racism in the APAC workplace):\n Consolidate quotes into one slide, demonstrating anti-Blackness and racism in APAC. \nSlide 22: Colorism Examples from one Country: \nWe forgot to talk about this slide in our meeting on 7/30. Seems to be about colorism in India only, but colorism exists throughout APAC. Not sure about calling out India. Also, it\u2019s currently designed as a large group eliciting activity, which is the worst kind of activity for APAC audiences. \nWe have slides on colorism in our AAPI Cultural Immersion we could borrow from.\n \nSlide 24: A Class Divided:\n Insert APAC-specific \u2018Class Divided\u2019 speaker notes (from Parker)\nSlide 30:\n \nThe Power of Language:\n Replace with LCW Coded Language slide and customize examples for APAC. Ask Brian for examples of coded language in APAC (give him our US examples as a model).\nSlide 33 IDC\n: Ask Brian for APAC-specific examples to replace #BLM and #ALM. \nSlide 38\n: Individual Commitments to Action: D\nClean up and finish all speaker notes\n: - \nwe can divide and conquer this next week??\nTo tailor the framing for APAC \u2013 what is the purpose, and why might we talk a little bit about anti-Black racism as a global issue\nTo adapt to the new design, ensure slide transitions are effective \nMake sure listening session notes and themes are incorporated throughout\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\nWE MUST GIVE THE DECK TO KERI BY NEXT TUES LATEST\n. So, I propose this timeline:\nFinish all of the above by this Thu night/Friday morning\nStart working on speaker notes on Friday\nComplete speaker notes on Monday\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\nRebecca M. Parrilla\n (MBA, Latina, LGBTQ, Mom)\n(she/her) \nWhy pronouns matter\nHead of Client Solutions\nWe help develop the mindsets and systems needed to foster resilient, diverse, and equitable teams that will be successful in a cross-cultural world.\nWebsite\n\u00a0\n|\n\u00a0\nFacebook\n\u00a0\n|\n\u00a0\nLinkedIn\n\u00a0\nI live and work in Chapel Hill, NC \u2013 on the traditional homelands of the Occaneechi, Shakori, Eno, and Sissipahaw peoples.",

I am interested and I\u2019m a mandarin speaking trainer. Will the materials be translated and delivered in Mandarin? \n\u00a0\nA couple of questions: \nFinished reading the deck, I\u2019m not very clear what we would like to achieve by this training. Understand it\u2019s a training for working inclusively and it\u2019s still being developed. \nA few things that I\u2019d like to see included in the discussion: \nBenefit of DEI programs. Yes, it\u2019s important to implement DEI programs. But they are not show and tells, there are real benefits from a diverse work force. I am a business owner, I would not hire just because I need to fulfill the DEI quota. It is because the different viewpoints and diverse background and experience the new hires will bring in. \nDistinction of Stereotype vs individuals. Media portrayal vs. reality. Why we should not assume when working with people from diverse background. \u00a0\nThe enslaved African in ancient Chinese history is an interesting trivia. But it has nothing to do with how Chinese treat or view Africans or African Americans today. It could easily be dismissed as a discussion topic since Chinese would say that that happened centuries ago, it is irrelevant today since we don\u2019t have slavery any more. It goes back to my point b on where the stereotype comes from. How have that affected our perception. \n\u00a0\nJust my two cents. Thanks! \n\u00a0\nBest regards, \n\u00a0\nZ.J.

Yes, it\u2019s important to implement DEI programs. But they are not show and tells, there are real benefits from a diverse work force. I am a business owner, I would not hire just because I need to fulfill the DEI quota. It is because the different viewpoints and diverse background and experience the new hires will bring in. \nDistinction of Stereotype vs individuals. Media portrayal vs. reality. Why we should not assume when working with people from diverse background. \u00a0\nThe enslaved African in ancient Chinese history is an interesting trivia. But it has nothing to do with how Chinese treat or view Africans or African Americans today. It could easily be dismissed as a discussion topic since Chinese would say that that happened centuries ago, it is irrelevant today since we don\u2019t have slavery any more.

It is currently still being worked on, but it should give you an idea of how the training will go.\nIf you speak Mandarin and are interested, please let me know when you can. If not, perhaps you would know someone who is that you can recommend.\nThanks so much for your consideration, and I look forward to hearing back .\nBest,\nVince\u00a0\nVince Bongiovanni\n(he/him)\nProject Assistant\nLCW\nWebsite\n\u00a0\n|\n\u00a0\nTwitter\n\u00a0\n|\n\u00a0\nFacebook\n\u00a0\n|\n\u00a0\nLinkedIn\nView our upcoming events\n\u00a0| \nSign-up for our newsletter",

I don't have the forms in my account because I didn't create them. Briza would create the Survey and send the links and QR code to the consultants.

In March, we participated in workshops in order to:\nUnderstand the impact of race at work drawing upon example from the Black/African-American community\nBuild empathy to have honest and/or courageous conversations\nCreate space for tackling tough subjects in today\u2019s context\nNow, we are continuing the conversation, diving into learning more about the Hispanic and Latino community, but also picking up the conversation about inclusion more generally.\nLater this summer, we will launch Embracing Diversity onboarding sessions, so that all employees, including new ones, understand that inclusion is part of Alpharetta\u2019s DNA. These sessions will be offered on a regular, ongoing basis, to introduce new employees to how they can contribute to our inclusive culture.\u00a0\nNow, I will turn it over to our partner at LCW, Ricardo to lead us into our workshop.\u00a0\n\u00a0\nThis was translated in Spanish giving the native speaker the option to change language\u00a0 of certain words in line with region as s/he wishes.\n\u00a0\nEl l\u00edder de Alpharetta, comparte c\u00f3mo sigue nuestro viaje de inclusi\u00f3n\nEn Alpharetta estamos comprometidos con una cultura de inclusi\u00f3n. En marzo, participamos en talleres con el fin de:\nComprender el impacto de las razas en el trabajo haciendo uso del ejemplo de la comunidad negra/afroamericana\nGenerar empat\u00eda para poder tener conversaciones honestas y/o valientes\nCrear espacio para enfrentar los asuntos en el contexto actual\nAhora, continuamos la conversaci\u00f3n, profundizando en aprender m\u00e1s sobre la comunidad hispana y latina, pero tambi\u00e9n retomar la conversaci\u00f3n sobre la inclusi\u00f3n de manera m\u00e1s general.\nM\u00e1s adelante, durante este verano, comenzaremos las sesiones de Abrazar la Diversidad para nuevos ingresados, de manera que todos los empleados, incluso los nuevos, comprendan que la inclusi\u00f3n forma parte del ADN de Alpharetta. Estas sesiones se ofrecer\u00e1n de manera regular y continua para que los nuevos empleados sepan c\u00f3mo pueden aportar a nuestra cultura inclusiva.\nAhora, le dejo el lugar a Ricardo, nuestro socio de LCW, qui\u00e9n nos presentar\u00e1 este taller.\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\nThanks Hollina,\n\u00a0\nBest\n\u00a0\nPatricia M Coleman\u00a0\n(She-Elle-Ella)\nSr Consultant\u00a0\u00a0\nLCW\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\nWebsite\n\u00a0\n|\n\u00a0\nTwitter\n\u00a0\n|\n\u00a0\nFacebook\n\u00a0\n|\n\u00a0\nLinkedIn\nView our upcoming events\n\u00a0| \nSign-up for our newsletter\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\nDisclaimer\nThe information contained in this communication from the sender is confidential.

Can you confirm and add in remaining slide numbers?\n\u00a0\nNotes say \u201cFocus on accents, and how certain people travel more than others. Slide with study by SAP.\u201d \u2013 Can you confirm if this is slide 20? \nYes\nNotes say \u201cDiminishing one people group\u2026\u201d \u2013 can you confirm this is slide 28? \nYes and 29\nNotes say \u201cOne of the leaders brought up comparisons with other countries, and we bring that in by comparing countries within the region throughout the training.\u201d \u2013 Can you let me know which slides? \nSlide 20, Singapore, slides 27-29, India, China, Japan, Malaysia\nNote say \u201cgender diversity is mentioned in the talk track\u201d \u2013 Can you let me know which slides? \nSlide 18 (added a bullet that was missing on women leaders)\n\u00a0\nNotes on initial review:\nSome initial thoughts \u2013 slide titled \u201cThe Goal\u201d: Cultural Competence, is #BlackLivesMatter and #AllLivesMatter a trending topic in Canada, LatAm and APAC? \nThis slide is common to all versions, but the hashtags can be removed outside of North America. We will confirm with the SMEs.\nAPAC slides on first review are looking very US focused/themed to me. \n42 looks US focused to me as we don\u2019t want to fucus on the Black experience exclusively for this group\n. I edited this slide to read \u201cmulticultural\u201d for APAC. The tailoring on this slide is in the language, how we refer to \u201cBlack\u201d or \u201cmulticultural\u201d talent. The previous version you saw had LATAM language, sorry about that. \nSlide 4\n \u2013 \nThis is the same for all versions, we may want to ensure all this language is current\nSlide 8\n -\nThese are the learning objectives, which are the same for all versions. However, we changed language to \u201cBlack and multicultural\u201d. As for slide 42, \nthe tailoring on this slide is in the language, how we refer to \u201cBlack\u201d or \u201cmulticultural\u201d talent. The previous version you saw had LATAM language, sorry about that. \nSlide 9 \u2013 \nThis is the agenda slide, basically the same for all versions except in how we refer to Black talent \u2013 changed language to \u201cBlack and multicultural\u201d\nSlide 12, Slide 13, Slide 14, Slide 15, Slide 16, for APAC again focuses/calls out Black talent. I think instead we\u2019d like to see another group here, women here for example.\n \nAs of now, we have these brief slides on Black talent in the US in all versions. This is to meet the mandate of educating all BSC employees across the globe about the experience of their Black colleagues in the US. If this is no longer the mandate, we can switch these slides out for information on another group. However, this will definitely weaken the focus on anti-racism\u2026In any case, since your review I have updated all three new versions to include the region-specific quiz right after these US-focused slides, and then the breakout, which will be focused on the regional data\n.\nSlides speak to the ARCH discussion guides \u2013 are new guides being developed/translated for these regions? Any resources we give need to be region appropriate. \nWe had not planned to update the discussion guides for the regions, as they are focused on a specific approach from Race Forward. I have removed any mention of them outside North America. We can add this to the scope if desired\nAre all groups receiving this same pre-work? \n\"How Much Do You Know About African American/Black Talent?\"\u00a0is referenced in Slide 1 of each. This should be appropriate for and specific to each region. I think if we send this resource out to APAC for example, ahead of the session your facilitator may receive resistance from participants.\n \nWe will either have to tailor the prework per region, or not include it.\nAre these the finalized talk tracks for each slide?\n \nNo, these are still in progress.\n\u00a0\nPlease note that I have gone through each deck since your review and updated each one to make them all more consistent with each other. There are v2s in the \nfolder on SharePoint\n. I have also made a spreadsheet (attached) that will help us compare versions.\n\u00a0\n-S\n\u00a0\nThanks,\nBethany\n\u00a0\nBethany Chan, Ph.D.\nPrincipal DE&I L&D Specialist\nEnterprise Talent Management\nPronouns: (she/her/hers)\nbethany.chan@bsci.com\n4100 Hamline Ave N\nArden Hills, MN\nwww.bostonscientific.com\n\u00a0\u00a0 \n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\nFrom:\n Vince Bongiovanni <\nv.bongiovanni@lcwmail.com\n> \nSent:\n Monday, July 8, 2024 5:41 PM\nTo:\n Chan, Bethany (she/her/hers) <\nBethany.Chan@bsci.com\n>; Sarah Nodarse <\nsarah@lcwmail.com\n>\nCc:\n Bird, Shani (she/her/hers) <\nShani.Bird@bsci.com\n>\nSubject:\n Re: {External} RE: ARCH - Notes from today's call.\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\nCAUTION\n: This email originated from outside of the organization.

I think instead we\u2019d like to see another group here, women here for example.\nSlides speak to the ARCH discussion guides \u2013 are new guides being developed/translated for these regions? Any resources we give need to be region appropriate.\nAre all groups receiving this same pre-work? \n\"How Much Do You Know About African American/Black Talent?\"\u00a0is referenced in Slide 1 of each.

    "body": "In case you need it while I\u2019m out.\n\u00a0\nFrom:\n Jas Kalra <kalra.jas@gmail.com> \nSent:\n Sunday, June 23, 2024 7:00 PM\nTo:\n Sarah Nodarse <s.nodarse@lcwmail.com>\nSubject:\n slide deck and quiz Attached\n\u00a0\nHappy Sunday evening Sarah,\n\u00a0\nHope all's well and you had a good vacation weekend!\u00a0\n\u00a0\nYou will probably see this tomorrow:) Let me know once you have\u00a0reviewed it.\u00a0 Please see an overview and a rationale of this PPT (attached via google drive) and attached Quiz. \n\u00a0\nCanada Regionalization 2024_JK.pptx\n\u00a0\n\u00a0I have attached a slide deck and the quiz here below.\u00a0\n\u00a0\nThis is a separate\u00a0slide deck and the way I have prepared it is that you can select the slides that you feel make sense to include or overlap with the EMEA PPT for CDN regionalization. It just made sense to do it this way.\u00a0 There's a lot of tools/practices in EMEA that are universal for inclusive leadership. I suggest integrating\u00a0these slides into EMEA as you see fit. This data is well researched and all sources/reasoning is provided in the notes section below on slides\n\u00a0\nHere's what I have included: \noverall Canadian statistics for different ethnicities, race etc. \u00a0in Canada there is not a universal approach for the term BIPOC or racialized or visible minority. There is a lot of variation in how organizations use this term Federal govt. uses visible minority and also racialized sometimes but that excludes Indigenous people; Private and corporate businesses use it as BIPOC or racialized.\u00a0\n\u00a0You will notice in the \"objectives\" slide I have used \u00a0BIPOC/racialized and multicultural . I suggest you keep it this way. and Here's the reason: \u00a0It is important to recognize that a blanket term like \u201cpeople of colour\u201d denies differences between members of racialized communities. (Like a few Arabs don't see themselves there) And \u201cPeople of colour\u201d should not be used to refer to Indigenous peoples as they are considered distinct societies under the Canadian Constitution. Person/people of colour and Black are not synonymous. BIPOC recognizes that while there may be some similarities between the experiences of Black, Indigenous peoples and the experiences of people of colour, there are important differences as well which need to be recognized (Juric, 2020) Some have noted that using the acronym BIPOC can suggest an interchangeability in being Black or a person of colour, thus failing to reflect the process of racialization, and suggest using \u201cracialized\u201d instead (Daniel, 2020).\nI have made changes to the above in the objective slide (original slide from EMEA). You can do the same in other slides from EMEA. \nThe presentation starts with \nThe why \n(of Inclusive Leadership) from CDN context: this section includes data, stats, changing landscape of canada\nWhat NOW\n section has a Ted Talk from Derek Sivers: this speaks to the importance of cultural competence and diverse perspectives among Leaders and leads to stereotypes and Unconscious Bias can lead to systemic discrimination as an impact.intentionally or unintentionally (some of the focus group comments speak of it ). Then a few CDN case studies that speak to unconscious bias and stereotypes.\u00a0\n\u00a0\nI have designed some slides that speak to focus group talking points. I think it would be useful to have a discussion around some points as\u00a0in slides 23/24.\u00a0\nand finally a few best practices and recommendations again from CDN study. all sources are listed there. The last slide is on communicating with Indigenous Partners/Leaders/Stakeholders\nLastly , The training has a lot of potential to facilitate an in-depth intercultural effectiveness/cross-cultural competence to your client, especially the global leaders. If you ever need support in facilitating/coaching for your clients I will be happy to collaborate. \nLet me know,\nBe well,\nJas\n\u00a0\nJas Kalra,\u00a0\nP\nr\no\nn\nou\nn\ns\n:\u00a0She, Her\u00a0\n/\n\u00a0\nP\nr\no\nn\no\nm\n: Elle\n\u00a0Executive Coach (PCC), ICF & Facilitator\nIntercultural Effectiveness, Inclusive Leadership,\u00a0 Leadership Development\nhttps://jaskalraconsulting.com/\nLeadership Circle profile & EQ2.o Certified practitioner\nCell: 613-868-4387\n\u00a0\nReceiving this email outside of normal working hours?

Regarding language preferences, I was able to talk with Hollina and we\u2019d like to offer sessions in Mandarin and Japanese. I\u2019m including notes from our session below for convenience.\n\u00a0\nNotes:\nBSC would prefer facilitators to be reflective of the region. \n$16,779 remaining on 2025 US prepay. July invoice will be sent to Bethany for initial review, then sent through Ariba for Shani\u2019s approval as it will be the first invoice of 2025 beyond the prepaid amount.\n\u00a0\nNext steps from BSC: \nIdentify preferred languages for APAC. (Done.)\n\u00a0\nNext steps from LCW: \nIdentify additional facilitator/s for APAC \u2013 Now that we\u2019ve identified languages, \n@Sarah Nodarse\n can you let me know when we might expect to reconvene on additional options?\nSend slide with facilitator information for Canada and LATAM \n\u00a0\nThanks for your partnership,\nBethany\n\u00a0\nBethany Chan, Ph.D.\nPrincipal DE&I L&D Specialist\nEnterprise Talent Management\nPronouns: (she/her/hers)\nbethany.chan@bsci.com\n4100 Hamline Ave N\nArden Hills, MN\nwww.bostonscientific.com",

It just made sense to do it this way.\u00a0 There's a lot of tools/practices in EMEA that are universal for inclusive leadership. I suggest integrating\u00a0these slides into EMEA as you see fit. This data is well researched and all sources/reasoning is provided in the notes section below on slides\n\u00a0\nHere's what I have included: \noverall Canadian statistics for different ethnicities, race etc. \u00a0in Canada there is not a universal approach for the term BIPOC or racialized or visible minority. There is a lot of variation in how organizations use this term Federal govt. uses visible minority and also racialized sometimes but that excludes Indigenous people; Private and corporate businesses use it as BIPOC or racialized.\u00a0\n\u00a0You will notice in the \"objectives\" slide I have used \u00a0BIPOC/racialized and multicultural . I suggest you keep it this way. and Here's the reason: \u00a0It is important to recognize that a blanket term like \u201cpeople of colour\u201d denies differences between members of racialized communities. (Like a few Arabs don't see themselves there) And \u201cPeople of colour\u201d should not be used to refer to Indigenous peoples as they are considered distinct societies under the Canadian Constitution. Person/people of colour and Black are not synonymous. BIPOC recognizes that while there may be some similarities between the experiences of Black, Indigenous peoples and the experiences of people of colour, there are important differences as well which need to be recognized (Juric, 2020) Some have noted that using the acronym BIPOC can suggest an interchangeability in being Black or a person of colour, thus failing to reflect the process of racialization, and suggest using \u201cracialized\u201d instead (Daniel, 2020).\nI have made changes to the above in the objective slide (original slide from EMEA). You can do the same in other slides from EMEA. \nThe presentation starts with \nThe why \n(of Inclusive Leadership) from CDN context: this section includes data, stats, changing landscape of canada\nWhat NOW\n section has a Ted Talk from Derek Sivers: this speaks to the importance of cultural competence and diverse perspectives among Leaders and leads to stereotypes and Unconscious Bias can lead to systemic discrimination as an impact.intentionally or unintentionally (some of the focus group comments speak of it ). Then a few CDN case studies that speak to unconscious bias and stereotypes.\u00a0\n\u00a0\nI have designed some slides that speak to focus group talking points. I think it would be useful to have a discussion around some points as\u00a0in slides 23/24.\u00a0\nand finally a few best practices and recommendations again from CDN study. all sources are listed there. The last slide is on communicating with Indigenous Partners/Leaders/Stakeholders\nLastly , The training has a lot of potential to facilitate an in-depth intercultural effectiveness/cross-cultural competence to your client, especially the global leaders. If you ever need support in facilitating/coaching for your clients I will be happy to collaborate. \nLet me know,\nBe well,\nJas\n\u00a0\nJas Kalra,\u00a0\nP\nr\no\nn\nou\nn\ns\n:\u00a0She, Her\u00a0\n/\n\u00a0\nP\nr\no\nn\no\nm\n: Elle\n\u00a0Executive Coach (PCC), ICF & Facilitator\nIntercultural Effectiveness, Inclusive Leadership,\u00a0 Leadership Development\nhttps://jaskalraconsulting.com/\nLeadership Circle profile & EQ2.o Certified practitioner\nCell: 613-868-4387\n\u00a0\nReceiving this email outside of normal working hours?

Be Security Conscious! \n\u00a0\nHi team,\n\u00a0\nJust checking in on this, I am pasting below the two options we had for simplified language for slide 13 \u2013 these are in the 4.12 Sharepoint deck, the one I downloaded to make the final version for signoff.\n\u00a0\nHollina, can you confirm that Option 2 was the one you proposed? If so I\u2019d like to gently push back\u2026\n\u00a0\nWe also discussed as a team, and we prefer Option 1 as it more closely reflects what we teach. I see a few things I would change in Option 2 \u2013 in \u201cUnderstand\u201d there is the term \u201ccultural environment\u201d and then \u201ccultural community\u201d and those two terms used together like that might be confusing. In \u201cAccept\u201d I would not use the term \u201cbiased\u201d as it is very negatively connotated and I would predict folks would raise their hands and say \u201cI\u2019m not biased!\u201d. For \u201cAdapt\u201d we thought that the language in Option 1 was simpler.\n\u00a0\nOverall, we recommend using Option 1. In addition, reading them over again, side by side, I would also recommend that we add in \u201cUnderstand\u201d, for the second bullet, after \u201cshaped my own identity,\u201d \u201cbased on the communities I have been a part of.\u201d\u00a0 \n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\nEager to hear your thoughts on this so we can get this content locked down!

The initial change request from Aisha was that we make the language more accessible by not using words like mitigate\u2014which I supplied some alternative language that is more accessible. So the request was not to change the questions to statements. The current format is wordy and does not present as well as it did in the question format, which was more visually appealing. \n\u00a0\nAlso, this format now has markers of comments on it, can you remove them? I have one example below \u2013 I see them on other slides as well. Also there is a slide listed as a poll, when we have no planned polls for the session \u2013 can you remove that?\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\nKind regards,\n\u00a0\nHollina Ung\nPrincipal DE&I Consultant\nDiversity, Equity and Inclusion\nShe / Her / Hers\nChicago, IL \nhollina.ung@bsci.com\nwww.bostonscientific.com\n\u00a0\u00a0 \n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\nFrom:\n Sarah Nodarse <\ns.nodarse@lcwmail.com\n> \nSent:\n Tuesday, June 4, 2024 8:36 AM\nTo:\n Ung, Hollina (she/her/hers) <\nHollina.Ung@bsci.com\n>; Patricia Coleman <\np.coleman@lcwmail.com\n>; Vince Bongiovanni <\nv.bongiovanni@lcwmail.com\n>\nCc:\n Bird, Shani (she/her/hers) <\nShani.Bird@bsci.com\n>; Chan, Bethany (she/her/hers) <\nBethany.Chan@bsci.com\n>\nSubject:\n RE: {External} Formatted deck & confirmation of Alpharetta Spotlights Scheduling\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\nCAUTION\n: This email originated from outside of the organization.

This was supposed to be an interactive activity where we ask participants to reflect on one of the questions on the screen and provide a response on how they will answer the questions listed. \nSlide 16 has an extra space in the first statement between colleagues and may.\nNeed to have periods after all the sentences for consistency.\n\u00a0\n@Vince Bongiovanni\n to your question in the separate chain \u2013 we will share information on timing of the sessions once the deck is approved and signed off after review with the Alpharetta leadership team.\n\u00a0\nKind regards,\n\u00a0\nHollina Ung\nPrincipal DE&I Consultant\nDiversity, Equity and Inclusion\nShe / Her / Hers\nChicago, IL \nhollina.ung@bsci.com\nwww.bostonscientific.com\n\u00a0\u00a0 \n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\nFrom:\n Patricia Coleman <\np.coleman@lcwmail.com\n> \nSent:\n Friday, May 31, 2024 6:12 AM\nTo:\n Ung, Hollina (she/her/hers) <\nHollina.Ung@bsci.com\n>\nCc:\n Sarah Nodarse <\nsarah@lcwmail.com\n>; Vince Bongiovanni <\nv.bongiovanni@lcwmail.com\n>\nSubject:\n {External} Formatted deck & confirmation of Alpharetta Spotlights Scheduling\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\nCAUTION\n: This email originated from outside of the organization.

    "subject": "FW: slide deck and quiz Attached",
    "body": "Canada\n\u00a0\nFrom:\n Jas Kalra <kalra.jas@gmail.com> \nSent:\n Sunday, June 23, 2024 7:00 PM\nTo:\n Sarah Nodarse <s.nodarse@lcwmail.com>\nSubject:\n slide deck and quiz Attached\n\u00a0\nHappy Sunday evening Sarah,\n\u00a0\nHope all's well and you had a good vacation weekend!\u00a0\n\u00a0\nYou will probably see this tomorrow:) Let me know once you have\u00a0reviewed it.\u00a0 Please see an overview and a rationale of this PPT (attached via google drive) and attached Quiz. \n\u00a0\nCanada Regionalization 2024_JK.pptx\n\u00a0\n\u00a0I have attached a slide deck and the quiz here below.\u00a0\n\u00a0\nThis is a separate\u00a0slide deck and the way I have prepared it is that you can select the slides that you feel make sense to include or overlap with the EMEA PPT for CDN regionalization. It just made sense to do it this way.\u00a0 There's a lot of tools/practices in EMEA that are universal for inclusive leadership. I suggest integrating\u00a0these slides into EMEA as you see fit. This data is well researched and all sources/reasoning is provided in the notes section below on slides\n\u00a0\nHere's what I have included: \noverall Canadian statistics for different ethnicities, race etc. \u00a0in Canada there is not a universal approach for the term BIPOC or racialized or visible minority. There is a lot of variation in how organizations use this term Federal govt. uses visible minority and also racialized sometimes but that excludes Indigenous people; Private and corporate businesses use it as BIPOC or racialized.\u00a0\n\u00a0You will notice in the \"objectives\" slide I have used \u00a0BIPOC/racialized and multicultural . I suggest you keep it this way. and Here's the reason: \u00a0It is important to recognize that a blanket term like \u201cpeople of colour\u201d denies differences between members of racialized communities. (Like a few Arabs don't see themselves there) And \u201cPeople of colour\u201d should not be used to refer to Indigenous peoples as they are considered distinct societies under the Canadian Constitution. Person/people of colour and Black are not synonymous. BIPOC recognizes that while there may be some similarities between the experiences of Black, Indigenous peoples and the experiences of people of colour, there are important differences as well which need to be recognized (Juric, 2020) Some have noted that using the acronym BIPOC can suggest an interchangeability in being Black or a person of colour, thus failing to reflect the process of racialization, and suggest using \u201cracialized\u201d instead (Daniel, 2020).\nI have made changes to the above in the objective slide (original slide from EMEA). You can do the same in other slides from EMEA. \nThe presentation starts with \nThe why \n(of Inclusive Leadership) from CDN context: this section includes data, stats, changing landscape of canada\nWhat NOW\n section has a Ted Talk from Derek Sivers: this speaks to the importance of cultural competence and diverse perspectives among Leaders and leads to stereotypes and Unconscious Bias can lead to systemic discrimination as an impact.intentionally or unintentionally (some of the focus group comments speak of it ). Then a few CDN case studies that speak to unconscious bias and stereotypes.\u00a0\n\u00a0\nI have designed some slides that speak to focus group talking points. I think it would be useful to have a discussion around some points as\u00a0in slides 23/24.\u00a0\nand finally a few best practices and recommendations again from CDN study. all sources are listed there. The last slide is on communicating with Indigenous Partners/Leaders/Stakeholders\nLastly , The training has a lot of potential to facilitate an in-depth intercultural effectiveness/cross-cultural competence to your client, especially the global leaders. If you ever need support in facilitating/coaching for your clients I will be happy to collaborate. \nLet me know,\nBe well,\nJas\n\u00a0\nJas Kalra,\u00a0\nP\nr\no\nn\nou\nn\ns\n:\u00a0She, Her\u00a0\n/\n\u00a0\nP\nr\no\nn\no\nm\n: Elle\n\u00a0Executive Coach (PCC), ICF & Facilitator\nIntercultural Effectiveness, Inclusive Leadership,\u00a0 Leadership Development\nhttps://jaskalraconsulting.com/\nLeadership Circle profile & EQ2.o Certified practitioner\nCell: 613-868-4387\n\u00a0\nReceiving this email outside of normal working hours?

    "subject": "Research Update: YS Index of Female Expatriation",
    "body": "YS Index of Female Expatriation\n\u00a0 \n \n\u00a0 \nImage of 'Expat' (miniseries) promotional still from Amazon Prime. (\nsource\n)\u00a0\nHi Dear YS members. \nI would like to share the \u2018Our Index of the Female Expatriation\u2019 as my last Young SIETAR Research Project. I began our YS research project \u2018How to Make Intercultural Connections with Female Expatriates: Exploring the Invisible Way of Successful Global Relocation\u2019 in 2023. \nHowever, it couldn\u2019t gain speed because of progress limitations as voluntary research. In the meantime, I need to step down from the YS research coordinator position for personal reasons. I believe that creating narratives about female expatriation has positive social impacts across cultures. So, I would like to share \u2018Our Index of the Female Expatriation\u2019 as my last work paper.\u00a0\nHow do I figure this out?\n \nHere is our starting point. I could be creative in my research when I enjoy art such as paintings, books, music, film, etc. Along the same lines, I encountered some points that I would like to research in the miniseries \u2018\nExpats (Amazon Prime Series\n)\u2019\u00a0\nSummary\n (Research Keywords in \nPurple\n)\nThe miniseries is summarised through the point of view of expatriation. Six episodes talk about Hong Kong residents who come from other countries. The miniseries largely centers around Margaret who is living in Hong Kong as an \nexpatriate partner\n. However, it also depicts \na multifaceted group of female expatriates\n.\u00a0\nIn the first half of the series, we come to know the background of \u2018Margaret' (Nicole Kidman) and her family. She had given up her job to follow her loving husband \u2018Clarke\u2019 to Hong Kong. \nTheir physical environment is good, living in a prestigious apartment block with other rich expats\n. However, Margaret felt \nnegative feelings\n such as isolation and anxiety\n because of \nher career break\n compared with her friends who are successful as CEOs or artists in her home country and, adding to this, conflict with her husband regarding his extension of expatriation time.\u00a0\nIn the middle of the series, the main issue happened. 'Gus', her youngest child \u00a0(among three) went\u00a0\nmissing\n in the middle of the market while she hung out with Mercy, a woman who wanted a nanny job. Later, while Margaret and her husband don\u2019t give up on finding their son, other drama unfolds involving Hilary, who is a \nneighbor of Margaret\u2019s family\n. Through the scenes of Hilary's mother visiting Hong Kong to see her\n, the audience can indirectly feel how she is \ntired of stereotypes as an Indian female and Indian expatriate\n.\nIndex\n| The Cultural Adaptation of Expatriates |\nAndersen, N.

Be Security Conscious! \n\u00a0\nHi team,\n\u00a0\nJust checking in on this, I am pasting below the two options we had for simplified language for slide 13 \u2013 these are in the 4.12 Sharepoint deck, the one I downloaded to make the final version for signoff.\n\u00a0\nHollina, can you confirm that Option 2 was the one you proposed? If so I\u2019d like to gently push back\u2026\n\u00a0\nWe also discussed as a team, and we prefer Option 1 as it more closely reflects what we teach. I see a few things I would change in Option 2 \u2013 in \u201cUnderstand\u201d there is the term \u201ccultural environment\u201d and then \u201ccultural community\u201d and those two terms used together like that might be confusing. In \u201cAccept\u201d I would not use the term \u201cbiased\u201d as it is very negatively connotated and I would predict folks would raise their hands and say \u201cI\u2019m not biased!\u201d. For \u201cAdapt\u201d we thought that the language in Option 1 was simpler.\n\u00a0\nOverall, we recommend using Option 1. In addition, reading them over again, side by side, I would also recommend that we add in \u201cUnderstand\u201d, for the second bullet, after \u201cshaped my own identity,\u201d \u201cbased on the communities I have been a part of.\u201d\u00a0 \n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\nEager to hear your thoughts on this so we can get this content locked down!

The initial change request from Aisha was that we make the language more accessible by not using words like mitigate\u2014which I supplied some alternative language that is more accessible. So the request was not to change the questions to statements. The current format is wordy and does not present as well as it did in the question format, which was more visually appealing. \n\u00a0\nAlso, this format now has markers of comments on it, can you remove them? I have one example below \u2013 I see them on other slides as well. Also there is a slide listed as a poll, when we have no planned polls for the session \u2013 can you remove that?\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\nKind regards,\n\u00a0\nHollina Ung\nPrincipal DE&I Consultant\nDiversity, Equity and Inclusion\nShe / Her / Hers\nChicago, IL \nhollina.ung@bsci.com\nwww.bostonscientific.com\n\u00a0\u00a0 \n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\nFrom:\n Sarah Nodarse <\ns.nodarse@lcwmail.com\n> \nSent:\n Tuesday, June 4, 2024 8:36 AM\nTo:\n Ung, Hollina (she/her/hers) <\nHollina.Ung@bsci.com\n>; Patricia Coleman <\np.coleman@lcwmail.com\n>; Vince Bongiovanni <\nv.bongiovanni@lcwmail.com\n>\nCc:\n Bird, Shani (she/her/hers) <\nShani.Bird@bsci.com\n>; Chan, Bethany (she/her/hers) <\nBethany.Chan@bsci.com\n>\nSubject:\n RE: {External} Formatted deck & confirmation of Alpharetta Spotlights Scheduling\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\nCAUTION\n: This email originated from outside of the organization.

This was supposed to be an interactive activity where we ask participants to reflect on one of the questions on the screen and provide a response on how they will answer the questions listed. \nSlide 16 has an extra space in the first statement between colleagues and may.\nNeed to have periods after all the sentences for consistency.\n\u00a0\n@Vince Bongiovanni\n to your question in the separate chain \u2013 we will share information on timing of the sessions once the deck is approved and signed off after review with the Alpharetta leadership team.\n\u00a0\nKind regards,\n\u00a0\nHollina Ung\nPrincipal DE&I Consultant\nDiversity, Equity and Inclusion\nShe / Her / Hers\nChicago, IL \nhollina.ung@bsci.com\nwww.bostonscientific.com\n\u00a0\u00a0 \n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\nFrom:\n Patricia Coleman <\np.coleman@lcwmail.com\n> \nSent:\n Friday, May 31, 2024 6:12 AM\nTo:\n Ung, Hollina (she/her/hers) <\nHollina.Ung@bsci.com\n>\nCc:\n Sarah Nodarse <\nsarah@lcwmail.com\n>; Vince Bongiovanni <\nv.bongiovanni@lcwmail.com\n>\nSubject:\n {External} Formatted deck & confirmation of Alpharetta Spotlights Scheduling\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\nCAUTION\n: This email originated from outside of the organization.

To recap the changes that we would like to see regarding timing and the other items that we talked about:\nSlide 14 should be shortened to 2-3 minutes rather than the 8 outlined in speaker notes\nSlide 18 should be lengthened to pick up the 5 minutes from slide 14\n, to 8 minutes total so that we hear more people share what actions they are gong to be taking \nCall out on not going down the rabbit hole on slide 12 with the role-play \u2013 will lean heavily on Ricardo to keep the conversation productive\nWe would like a call set up with Ricardo for him to meet the Alpharetta leadership team and to review expectations.\n Here are a few times that will work for us:\nJune 24 at 12:00 or 12:30 PM CT\nJune 25 at 12:30 PM CT\nJune 26 at 12:00 or12:30 PM CT\nJuly 10 at 1 or 1:30 PM CT\nAisha will be providing the session times by the end of next week, but please plan for the first session to start at around 8:00 AM ET and the last session to end around 4:30/5:00 PM ET on Wednesday. We recommend that Ricardo fly in the night before for the first session. \nCouple of reminders:\nSince the bulk of the participants are DL employees, they may be late to the session, so to ensure that we are not rushing through content, we are allowing for \na 15 minute buffer \nafter each session so that we can cover all the important points with as many people as possible. Aisha will schedule accordingly for this.\nLCW will provide the \u201cIntent vs. Impact\u201d slide as a handout for all participants \u2013 240 copies for the 240 participants/attendees\n\u00a0\nGlad to see the progress that we are making on this Spotlight on the Hispanic/Latino Community session.

Be Security Conscious! \n\u00a0\nHi team,\n\u00a0\nJust checking in on this, I am pasting below the two options we had for simplified language for slide 13 \u2013 these are in the 4.12 Sharepoint deck, the one I downloaded to make the final version for signoff.\n\u00a0\nHollina, can you confirm that Option 2 was the one you proposed? If so I\u2019d like to gently push back\u2026\n\u00a0\nWe also discussed as a team, and we prefer Option 1 as it more closely reflects what we teach. I see a few things I would change in Option 2 \u2013 in \u201cUnderstand\u201d there is the term \u201ccultural environment\u201d and then \u201ccultural community\u201d and those two terms used together like that might be confusing. In \u201cAccept\u201d I would not use the term \u201cbiased\u201d as it is very negatively connotated and I would predict folks would raise their hands and say \u201cI\u2019m not biased!\u201d. For \u201cAdapt\u201d we thought that the language in Option 1 was simpler.\n\u00a0\nOverall, we recommend using Option 1. In addition, reading them over again, side by side, I would also recommend that we add in \u201cUnderstand\u201d, for the second bullet, after \u201cshaped my own identity,\u201d \u201cbased on the communities I have been a part of.\u201d\u00a0 \n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\nEager to hear your thoughts on this so we can get this content locked down!

The initial change request from Aisha was that we make the language more accessible by not using words like mitigate\u2014which I supplied some alternative language that is more accessible. So the request was not to change the questions to statements. The current format is wordy and does not present as well as it did in the question format, which was more visually appealing. \n\u00a0\nAlso, this format now has markers of comments on it, can you remove them? I have one example below \u2013 I see them on other slides as well.

This was supposed to be an interactive activity where we ask participants to reflect on one of the questions on the screen and provide a response on how they will answer the questions listed. \nSlide 16 has an extra space in the first statement between colleagues and may.\nNeed to have periods after all the sentences for consistency.\n\u00a0\n@Vince Bongiovanni\n to your question in the separate chain \u2013 we will share information on timing of the sessions once the deck is approved and signed off after review with the Alpharetta leadership team.\n\u00a0\nKind regards,\n\u00a0\nHollina Ung\nPrincipal DE&I Consultant\nDiversity, Equity and Inclusion\nShe / Her / Hers\nChicago, IL \nhollina.ung@bsci.com\nwww.bostonscientific.com\n\u00a0\u00a0 \n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\nFrom:\n Patricia Coleman <\np.coleman@lcwmail.com\n> \nSent:\n Friday, May 31, 2024 6:12 AM\nTo:\n Ung, Hollina (she/her/hers) <\nHollina.Ung@bsci.com\n>\nCc:\n Sarah Nodarse <\nsarah@lcwmail.com\n>; Vince Bongiovanni <\nv.bongiovanni@lcwmail.com\n>\nSubject:\n {External} Formatted deck & confirmation of Alpharetta Spotlights Scheduling\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\nCAUTION\n: This email originated from outside of the organization.

There are there decks (slides that will be used for 3 hour virtual\u00a0sessions.)\nLATAM - Adriana\nCanda\nAPAC\n2. Each deck should have the same structure, the content based on regionalization is what differs between each slide deck, is this correct? Refer to information\u00a0in the EMEA Regionalization folder (2022) as the model as I update the slides.\n3. The SME (for example, Adriana) will add the content, I will \"clean\" up the slide and ensure the speaker notes include the information needed for the facilitator to lead each session. Is this correct?\n4. Are all three decks due 6/26 or just\u00a0LATAM?\n5. Have the SMEs for Canada and APAC added their content for regionalization, where can I find the updates needed for these decks? I have the content from Andriana, our conversation yesterday\u00a0provided context and helped me to understand the intent.\u00a0\n6. Will all three decks includes the\u00a0 U.S. portion that Andriana included\u00a0with her deck?\nThanks,\nEileen",

Patricia gave me your email, I am reaching out about some urgent customization work that needs to be done by the end of next week. I have included some background below and attached. \nWe are closed tomorrow for Juneteenth and I am traveling Thurs-Fri this week, but Vince and Chuck can help coordinate your involvement, should you choose to jump in\n. It\u2019s probably about 5-10 hours of work to do this customization.\n\u00a0\nHere is a link to the folder of materials: \nhttps://www.dropbox.com/scl/fo/4gj3w0n4y51fktmw8jpq0/AB47h9oHGfeLnA9yslfDPOA?rlkey=fmnik2n22nbowbfj6cjjzu5xy&st=su66k6cc&dl=0\n\u00a0\nBACKGROUND: The job entails building some slides to tailor the attached training for the Canada region (see PDF). It\u2019s for Boston Scientific, a global medical devices company that is one of our biggest clients. \n\u00a0\nThis training is called \u201cLeading Inclusively: What You Need To Know About Your Black Talent,\u201d and it is part of a multi-year, corporate-wide anti-racism program called \u201cARCH\u201d (stands for \u201cAnti-Racism and Cultural History\u201d). I can give you more details about the program if you decide to do the work, but for now you can check out \nthis link\n on BSC\u2019s website, and suffice to say that this Leading Inclusively course is for roughly 5,000 people managers across the BSC globe. We have already delivered it to hundreds of managers in the US and EMEA regions. Now, we are expanding to the other regions. The idea is to tailor the content by region, so participants in don\u2019t feel like the training is too US-focused.\n\u00a0\nTo tailor for Canada, we did focus groups with BSC\u2019s LATAM stakeholders (notes are in the linked folder), and created recommendations for tailoring the training already (also in the linked folder).\n Your job would be to implement these recommendations by doing research and creating the DRAFT slides\n. We would do the formatting of course. Vince and I would work with you to make sure you understand the detailed learning objectives of what we were tailoring, and check in with you along the way to ensure it goes smoothly.\n\u00a0\nYou will see from reading the regionalization recommendations that there is a core question we are grappling with when doing these regional tailorings, and that is: \u201cis it appropriate to focus on the US Black Experience?\u201d\n\u00a0\nThe answer is yes, AND\u2026.\n\u00a0\nYes, we want to focus on the US Black Experience because BSC is an American company, based in the US, and colleagues around the globe need to understand the particular experience of their US colleagues.\u00a0 AND \u2013 we want to make sure that we are ALSO talking about race and racism in a way that is relevant to folks in different regions. Some regions have pushed back pretty strongly on the idea of doing training focused on race or Blackness at all (APAC, for example). \n\u00a0\nWe need this work completed by next Wednesday so that we can review it in time for a meeting with the client on July 1, would that be possible for you? If you have questions, please reply to this email and Vince or I will respond!\n\u00a0\nThanks for letting us know!\n\u00a0\nSarah\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\nSarah Nodarse\n(she/her)\nPrincipal Consultant\nLCW\n4753 N Broadway, Flr. 2\nChicago, IL 60640\n\u00a0\n773-828-6781 (office)\n773-474-9138 (direct)\ns.nodarse@lcwmail.com\n<image003.png>\n\u00a0\nWebsite | Twitter | Facebook | LinkedIn\nView our upcoming events | Sign-up for our newsletter\n\u00a0\nI live and work in Chicago, IL \u2013 on the unceded territory of the Pokagon band of Potawatomi.

Each deck should have the same structure, the content based on regionalization is what differs between each slide deck, is this correct? Refer to information\u00a0in the EMEA Regionalization folder (2022) as the model as I update the slides.\n3. The SME (for example, Adriana) will add the content, I will \"clean\" up the slide and ensure the speaker notes include the information needed for the facilitator to lead each session. Is this correct?\n4. Are all three decks due 6/26 or just\u00a0LATAM?\n5. Have the SMEs for Canada and APAC added their content for regionalization, where can I find the updates needed for these decks? I have the content from Andriana, our conversation yesterday\u00a0provided context and helped me to understand the intent.\u00a0\n6. Will all three decks includes the\u00a0 U.S. portion that Andriana included\u00a0with her deck?\nThanks,\nEileen",

To recap the changes that we would like to see regarding timing and the other items that we talked about:\nSlide 14 should be shortened to 2-3 minutes rather than the 8 outlined in speaker notes\nSlide 18 should be lengthened to pick up the 5 minutes from slide 14\n, to 8 minutes total so that we hear more people share what actions they are gong to be taking \nCall out on not going down the rabbit hole on slide 12 with the role-play \u2013 will lean heavily on Ricardo to keep the conversation productive\nWe would like a call set up with Ricardo for him to meet the Alpharetta leadership team and to review expectations.\n Here are a few times that will work for us:\nJune 24 at 12:00 or 12:30 PM CT\nJune 25 at 12:30 PM CT\nJune 26 at 12:00 or12:30 PM CT\nJuly 10 at 1 or 1:30 PM CT\nAisha will be providing the session times by the end of next week, but please plan for the first session to start at around 8:00 AM ET and the last session to end around 4:30/5:00 PM ET on Wednesday. We recommend that Ricardo fly in the night before for the first session. \nCouple of reminders:\nSince the bulk of the participants are DL employees, they may be late to the session, so to ensure that we are not rushing through content, we are allowing for \na 15 minute buffer \nafter each session so that we can cover all the important points with as many people as possible. Aisha will schedule accordingly for this.\nLCW will provide the \u201cIntent vs. Impact\u201d slide as a handout for all participants \u2013 240 copies for the 240 participants/attendees\n\u00a0\nGlad to see the progress that we are making on this Spotlight on the Hispanic/Latino Community session.

Be Security Conscious! \n\u00a0\nHi team,\n\u00a0\nJust checking in on this, I am pasting below the two options we had for simplified language for slide 13 \u2013 these are in the 4.12 Sharepoint deck, the one I downloaded to make the final version for signoff.\n\u00a0\nHollina, can you confirm that Option 2 was the one you proposed? If so I\u2019d like to gently push back\u2026\n\u00a0\nWe also discussed as a team, and we prefer Option 1 as it more closely reflects what we teach. I see a few things I would change in Option 2 \u2013 in \u201cUnderstand\u201d there is the term \u201ccultural environment\u201d and then \u201ccultural community\u201d and those two terms used together like that might be confusing. In \u201cAccept\u201d I would not use the term \u201cbiased\u201d as it is very negatively connotated and I would predict folks would raise their hands and say \u201cI\u2019m not biased!\u201d. For \u201cAdapt\u201d we thought that the language in Option 1 was simpler.\n\u00a0\nOverall, we recommend using Option 1. In addition, reading them over again, side by side, I would also recommend that we add in \u201cUnderstand\u201d, for the second bullet, after \u201cshaped my own identity,\u201d \u201cbased on the communities I have been a part of.\u201d\u00a0 \n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\nEager to hear your thoughts on this so we can get this content locked down!

The initial change request from Aisha was that we make the language more accessible by not using words like mitigate\u2014which I supplied some alternative language that is more accessible. So the request was not to change the questions to statements. The current format is wordy and does not present as well as it did in the question format, which was more visually appealing. \n\u00a0\nAlso, this format now has markers of comments on it, can you remove them? I have one example below \u2013 I see them on other slides as well. Also there is a slide listed as a poll, when we have no planned polls for the session \u2013 can you remove that?\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\nKind regards,\n\u00a0\nHollina Ung\nPrincipal DE&I Consultant\nDiversity, Equity and Inclusion\nShe / Her / Hers\nChicago, IL \nhollina.ung@bsci.com\nwww.bostonscientific.com\n\u00a0\u00a0 \n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\nFrom:\n Sarah Nodarse <\ns.nodarse@lcwmail.com\n> \nSent:\n Tuesday, June 4, 2024 8:36 AM\nTo:\n Ung, Hollina (she/her/hers) <\nHollina.Ung@bsci.com\n>; Patricia Coleman <\np.coleman@lcwmail.com\n>; Vince Bongiovanni <\nv.bongiovanni@lcwmail.com\n>\nCc:\n Bird, Shani (she/her/hers) <\nShani.Bird@bsci.com\n>; Chan, Bethany (she/her/hers) <\nBethany.Chan@bsci.com\n>\nSubject:\n RE: {External} Formatted deck & confirmation of Alpharetta Spotlights Scheduling\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\nCAUTION\n: This email originated from outside of the organization.

To recap the changes that we would like to see regarding timing and the other items that we talked about:\nSlide 14 should be shortened to 2-3 minutes rather than the 8 outlined in speaker notes\nSlide 18 should be lengthened to pick up the 5 minutes from slide 14\n, to 8 minutes total so that we hear more people share what actions they are gong to be taking \nCall out on not going down the rabbit hole on slide 12 with the role-play \u2013 will lean heavily on Ricardo to keep the conversation productive\nWe would like a call set up with Ricardo for him to meet the Alpharetta leadership team and to review expectations.\n Here are a few times that will work for us:\nJune 24 at 12:00 or 12:30 PM CT\nJune 25 at 12:30 PM CT\nJune 26 at 12:00 or12:30 PM CT\nJuly 10 at 1 or 1:30 PM CT\nAisha will be providing the session times by the end of next week, but please plan for the first session to start at around 8:00 AM ET and the last session to end around 4:30/5:00 PM ET on Wednesday. We recommend that Ricardo fly in the night before for the first session. \nCouple of reminders:\nSince the bulk of the participants are DL employees, they may be late to the session, so to ensure that we are not rushing through content, we are allowing for \na 15 minute buffer \nafter each session so that we can cover all the important points with as many people as possible. Aisha will schedule accordingly for this.\nLCW will provide the \u201cIntent vs. Impact\u201d slide as a handout for all participants \u2013 240 copies for the 240 participants/attendees\n\u00a0\nGlad to see the progress that we are making on this Spotlight on the Hispanic/Latino Community session.

Be Security Conscious! \n\u00a0\nHi team,\n\u00a0\nJust checking in on this, I am pasting below the two options we had for simplified language for slide 13 \u2013 these are in the 4.12 Sharepoint deck, the one I downloaded to make the final version for signoff.\n\u00a0\nHollina, can you confirm that Option 2 was the one you proposed? If so I\u2019d like to gently push back\u2026\n\u00a0\nWe also discussed as a team, and we prefer Option 1 as it more closely reflects what we teach. I see a few things I would change in Option 2 \u2013 in \u201cUnderstand\u201d there is the term \u201ccultural environment\u201d and then \u201ccultural community\u201d and those two terms used together like that might be confusing. In \u201cAccept\u201d I would not use the term \u201cbiased\u201d as it is very negatively connotated and I would predict folks would raise their hands and say \u201cI\u2019m not biased!\u201d.

The initial change request from Aisha was that we make the language more accessible by not using words like mitigate\u2014which I supplied some alternative language that is more accessible. So the request was not to change the questions to statements. The current format is wordy and does not present as well as it did in the question format, which was more visually appealing. \n\u00a0\nAlso, this format now has markers of comments on it, can you remove them? I have one example below \u2013 I see them on other slides as well. Also there is a slide listed as a poll, when we have no planned polls for the session \u2013 can you remove that?\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\nKind regards,\n\u00a0\nHollina Ung\nPrincipal DE&I Consultant\nDiversity, Equity and Inclusion\nShe / Her / Hers\nChicago, IL \nhollina.ung@bsci.com\nwww.bostonscientific.com\n\u00a0\u00a0 \n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\nFrom:\n Sarah Nodarse <\ns.nodarse@lcwmail.com\n> \nSent:\n Tuesday, June 4, 2024 8:36 AM\nTo:\n Ung, Hollina (she/her/hers) <\nHollina.Ung@bsci.com\n>; Patricia Coleman <\np.coleman@lcwmail.com\n>; Vince Bongiovanni <\nv.bongiovanni@lcwmail.com\n>\nCc:\n Bird, Shani (she/her/hers) <\nShani.Bird@bsci.com\n>; Chan, Bethany (she/her/hers) <\nBethany.Chan@bsci.com\n>\nSubject:\n RE: {External} Formatted deck & confirmation of Alpharetta Spotlights Scheduling\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\nCAUTION\n: This email originated from outside of the organization.

This was supposed to be an interactive activity where we ask participants to reflect on one of the questions on the screen and provide a response on how they will answer the questions listed. \nSlide 16 has an extra space in the first statement between colleagues and may.\nNeed to have periods after all the sentences for consistency.\n\u00a0\n@Vince Bongiovanni\n to your question in the separate chain \u2013 we will share information on timing of the sessions once the deck is approved and signed off after review with the Alpharetta leadership team.\n\u00a0\nKind regards,\n\u00a0\nHollina Ung\nPrincipal DE&I Consultant\nDiversity, Equity and Inclusion\nShe / Her / Hers\nChicago, IL \nhollina.ung@bsci.com\nwww.bostonscientific.com\n\u00a0\u00a0 \n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\nFrom:\n Patricia Coleman <\np.coleman@lcwmail.com\n> \nSent:\n Friday, May 31, 2024 6:12 AM\nTo:\n Ung, Hollina (she/her/hers) <\nHollina.Ung@bsci.com\n>\nCc:\n Sarah Nodarse <\nsarah@lcwmail.com\n>; Vince Bongiovanni <\nv.bongiovanni@lcwmail.com\n>\nSubject:\n {External} Formatted deck & confirmation of Alpharetta Spotlights Scheduling\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\nCAUTION\n: This email originated from outside of the organization.

To recap the changes that we would like to see regarding timing and the other items that we talked about:\nSlide 14 should be shortened to 2-3 minutes rather than the 8 outlined in speaker notes\nSlide 18 should be lengthened to pick up the 5 minutes from slide 14\n, to 8 minutes total so that we hear more people share what actions they are gong to be taking \nCall out on not going down the rabbit hole on slide 12 with the role-play \u2013 will lean heavily on Ricardo to keep the conversation productive\nWe would like a call set up with Ricardo for him to meet the Alpharetta leadership team and to review expectations.\n Here are a few times that will work for us:\nJune 24 at 12:00 or 12:30 PM CT\nJune 25 at 12:30 PM CT\nJune 26 at 12:00 or12:30 PM CT\nJuly 10 at 1 or 1:30 PM CT\nAisha will be providing the session times by the end of next week, but please plan for the first session to start at around 8:00 AM ET and the last session to end around 4:30/5:00 PM ET on Wednesday. We recommend that Ricardo fly in the night before for the first session. \nCouple of reminders:\nSince the bulk of the participants are DL employees, they may be late to the session, so to ensure that we are not rushing through content, we are allowing for \na 15 minute buffer \nafter each session so that we can cover all the important points with as many people as possible. Aisha will schedule accordingly for this.\nLCW will provide the \u201cIntent vs. Impact\u201d slide as a handout for all participants \u2013 240 copies for the 240 participants/attendees\n\u00a0\nGlad to see the progress that we are making on this Spotlight on the Hispanic/Latino Community session.

If so I\u2019d like to gently push back\u2026\n\u00a0\nWe also discussed as a team, and we prefer Option 1 as it more closely reflects what we teach. I see a few things I would change in Option 2 \u2013 in \u201cUnderstand\u201d there is the term \u201ccultural environment\u201d and then \u201ccultural community\u201d and those two terms used together like that might be confusing. In \u201cAccept\u201d I would not use the term \u201cbiased\u201d as it is very negatively connotated and I would predict folks would raise their hands and say \u201cI\u2019m not biased!\u201d. For \u201cAdapt\u201d we thought that the language in Option 1 was simpler.\n\u00a0\nOverall, we recommend using Option 1. In addition, reading them over again, side by side, I would also recommend that we add in \u201cUnderstand\u201d, for the second bullet, after \u201cshaped my own identity,\u201d \u201cbased on the communities I have been a part of.\u201d\u00a0 \n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\nEager to hear your thoughts on this so we can get this content locked down!

The initial change request from Aisha was that we make the language more accessible by not using words like mitigate\u2014which I supplied some alternative language that is more accessible. So the request was not to change the questions to statements. The current format is wordy and does not present as well as it did in the question format, which was more visually appealing. \n\u00a0\nAlso, this format now has markers of comments on it, can you remove them? I have one example below \u2013 I see them on other slides as well.

To recap the changes that we would like to see regarding timing and the other items that we talked about:\nSlide 14 should be shortened to 2-3 minutes rather than the 8 outlined in speaker notes\nSlide 18 should be lengthened to pick up the 5 minutes from slide 14\n, to 8 minutes total so that we hear more people share what actions they are gong to be taking \nCall out on not going down the rabbit hole on slide 12 with the role-play \u2013 will lean heavily on Ricardo to keep the conversation productive\nWe would like a call set up with Ricardo for him to meet the Alpharetta leadership team and to review expectations.\n Here are a few times that will work for us:\nJune 24 at 12:00 or 12:30 PM CT\nJune 25 at 12:30 PM CT\nJune 26 at 12:00 or12:30 PM CT\nJuly 10 at 1 or 1:30 PM CT\nAisha will be providing the session times by the end of next week, but please plan for the first session to start at around 8:00 AM ET and the last session to end around 4:30/5:00 PM ET on Wednesday. We recommend that Ricardo fly in the night before for the first session. \nCouple of reminders:\nSince the bulk of the participants are DL employees, they may be late to the session, so to ensure that we are not rushing through content, we are allowing for \na 15 minute buffer \nafter each session so that we can cover all the important points with as many people as possible. Aisha will schedule accordingly for this.\nLCW will provide the \u201cIntent vs. Impact\u201d slide as a handout for all participants \u2013 240 copies for the 240 participants/attendees\n\u00a0\nGlad to see the progress that we are making on this Spotlight on the Hispanic/Latino Community session.

Be Security Conscious! \n\u00a0\nHi team,\n\u00a0\nJust checking in on this, I am pasting below the two options we had for simplified language for slide 13 \u2013 these are in the 4.12 Sharepoint deck, the one I downloaded to make the final version for signoff.\n\u00a0\nHollina, can you confirm that Option 2 was the one you proposed? If so I\u2019d like to gently push back\u2026\n\u00a0\nWe also discussed as a team, and we prefer Option 1 as it more closely reflects what we teach. I see a few things I would change in Option 2 \u2013 in \u201cUnderstand\u201d there is the term \u201ccultural environment\u201d and then \u201ccultural community\u201d and those two terms used together like that might be confusing. In \u201cAccept\u201d I would not use the term \u201cbiased\u201d as it is very negatively connotated and I would predict folks would raise their hands and say \u201cI\u2019m not biased!\u201d. For \u201cAdapt\u201d we thought that the language in Option 1 was simpler.\n\u00a0\nOverall, we recommend using Option 1. In addition, reading them over again, side by side, I would also recommend that we add in \u201cUnderstand\u201d, for the second bullet, after \u201cshaped my own identity,\u201d \u201cbased on the communities I have been a part of.\u201d\u00a0 \n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\nEager to hear your thoughts on this so we can get this content locked down!

The initial change request from Aisha was that we make the language more accessible by not using words like mitigate\u2014which I supplied some alternative language that is more accessible. So the request was not to change the questions to statements. The current format is wordy and does not present as well as it did in the question format, which was more visually appealing. \n\u00a0\nAlso, this format now has markers of comments on it, can you remove them? I have one example below \u2013 I see them on other slides as well. Also there is a slide listed as a poll, when we have no planned polls for the session \u2013 can you remove that?\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\nKind regards,\n\u00a0\nHollina Ung\nPrincipal DE&I Consultant\nDiversity, Equity and Inclusion\nShe / Her / Hers\nChicago, IL \nhollina.ung@bsci.com\nwww.bostonscientific.com\n\u00a0\u00a0 \n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\nFrom:\n Sarah Nodarse <\ns.nodarse@lcwmail.com\n> \nSent:\n Tuesday, June 4, 2024 8:36 AM\nTo:\n Ung, Hollina (she/her/hers) <\nHollina.Ung@bsci.com\n>; Patricia Coleman <\np.coleman@lcwmail.com\n>; Vince Bongiovanni <\nv.bongiovanni@lcwmail.com\n>\nCc:\n Bird, Shani (she/her/hers) <\nShani.Bird@bsci.com\n>; Chan, Bethany (she/her/hers) <\nBethany.Chan@bsci.com\n>\nSubject:\n RE: {External} Formatted deck & confirmation of Alpharetta Spotlights Scheduling\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\nCAUTION\n: This email originated from outside of the organization.

This was supposed to be an interactive activity where we ask participants to reflect on one of the questions on the screen and provide a response on how they will answer the questions listed. \nSlide 16 has an extra space in the first statement between colleagues and may.\nNeed to have periods after all the sentences for consistency.\n\u00a0\n@Vince Bongiovanni\n to your question in the separate chain \u2013 we will share information on timing of the sessions once the deck is approved and signed off after review with the Alpharetta leadership team.\n\u00a0\nKind regards,\n\u00a0\nHollina Ung\nPrincipal DE&I Consultant\nDiversity, Equity and Inclusion\nShe / Her / Hers\nChicago, IL \nhollina.ung@bsci.com\nwww.bostonscientific.com\n\u00a0\u00a0 \n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\nFrom:\n Patricia Coleman <\np.coleman@lcwmail.com\n> \nSent:\n Friday, May 31, 2024 6:12 AM\nTo:\n Ung, Hollina (she/her/hers) <\nHollina.Ung@bsci.com\n>\nCc:\n Sarah Nodarse <\nsarah@lcwmail.com\n>; Vince Bongiovanni <\nv.bongiovanni@lcwmail.com\n>\nSubject:\n {External} Formatted deck & confirmation of Alpharetta Spotlights Scheduling\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\nCAUTION\n: This email originated from outside of the organization.

To recap the changes that we would like to see regarding timing and the other items that we talked about:\nSlide 14 should be shortened to 2-3 minutes rather than the 8 outlined in speaker notes\nSlide 18 should be lengthened to pick up the 5 minutes from slide 14\n, to 8 minutes total so that we hear more people share what actions they are gong to be taking \nCall out on not going down the rabbit hole on slide 12 with the role-play \u2013 will lean heavily on Ricardo to keep the conversation productive\nWe would like a call set up with Ricardo for him to meet the Alpharetta leadership team and to review expectations.\n Here are a few times that will work for us:\nJune 24 at 12:00 or 12:30 PM CT\nJune 25 at 12:30 PM CT\nJune 26 at 12:00 or12:30 PM CT\nJuly 10 at 1 or 1:30 PM CT\nAisha will be providing the session times by the end of next week, but please plan for the first session to start at around 8:00 AM ET and the last session to end around 4:30/5:00 PM ET on Wednesday. We recommend that Ricardo fly in the night before for the first session. \nCouple of reminders:\nSince the bulk of the participants are DL employees, they may be late to the session, so to ensure that we are not rushing through content, we are allowing for \na 15 minute buffer \nafter each session so that we can cover all the important points with as many people as possible. Aisha will schedule accordingly for this.\nLCW will provide the \u201cIntent vs. Impact\u201d slide as a handout for all participants \u2013 240 copies for the 240 participants/attendees\n\u00a0\nGlad to see the progress that we are making on this Spotlight on the Hispanic/Latino Community session. Thank you for your partnership to get us to this point. \n\u00a0\nKind regards,\n\u00a0\nHollina Ung\nPrincipal DE&I Consultant\nDiversity, Equity and Inclusion\nShe / Her / Hers\nChicago, IL \nhollina.ung@bsci.com\nwww.bostonscientific.com\n\u00a0\u00a0 \n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\nFrom:\n Sarah Nodarse <\ns.nodarse@lcwmail.com\n> \nSent:\n Friday, June 7, 2024 1:59 PM\nTo:\n Ung, Hollina (she/her/hers) <\nHollina.Ung@bsci.com\n>; Patricia Coleman <\np.coleman@lcwmail.com\n>; Vince Bongiovanni <\nv.bongiovanni@lcwmail.com\n>\nCc:\n Bird, Shani (she/her/hers) <\nShani.Bird@bsci.com\n>; Chan, Bethany (she/her/hers) <\nBethany.Chan@bsci.com\n>\nSubject:\n RE: {External} Formatted deck & confirmation of Alpharetta Spotlights Scheduling\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\nCAUTION\n: This email originated from outside of the organization.

Be Security Conscious! \n\u00a0\nHi team,\n\u00a0\nJust checking in on this, I am pasting below the two options we had for simplified language for slide 13 \u2013 these are in the 4.12 Sharepoint deck, the one I downloaded to make the final version for signoff.\n\u00a0\nHollina, can you confirm that Option 2 was the one you proposed? If so I\u2019d like to gently push back\u2026\n\u00a0\nWe also discussed as a team, and we prefer Option 1 as it more closely reflects what we teach. I see a few things I would change in Option 2 \u2013 in \u201cUnderstand\u201d there is the term \u201ccultural environment\u201d and then \u201ccultural community\u201d and those two terms used together like that might be confusing. In \u201cAccept\u201d I would not use the term \u201cbiased\u201d as it is very negatively connotated and I would predict folks would raise their hands and say \u201cI\u2019m not biased!\u201d. For \u201cAdapt\u201d we thought that the language in Option 1 was simpler.\n\u00a0\nOverall, we recommend using Option 1. In addition, reading them over again, side by side, I would also recommend that we add in \u201cUnderstand\u201d, for the second bullet, after \u201cshaped my own identity,\u201d \u201cbased on the communities I have been a part of.\u201d\u00a0 \n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\nEager to hear your thoughts on this so we can get this content locked down!

The initial change request from Aisha was that we make the language more accessible by not using words like mitigate\u2014which I supplied some alternative language that is more accessible. So the request was not to change the questions to statements. The current format is wordy and does not present as well as it did in the question format, which was more visually appealing. \n\u00a0\nAlso, this format now has markers of comments on it, can you remove them? I have one example below \u2013 I see them on other slides as well.

To recap the changes that we would like to see regarding timing and the other items that we talked about:\nSlide 14 should be shortened to 2-3 minutes rather than the 8 outlined in speaker notes\nSlide 18 should be lengthened to pick up the 5 minutes from slide 14\n, to 8 minutes total so that we hear more people share what actions they are gong to be taking \nCall out on not going down the rabbit hole on slide 12 with the role-play \u2013 will lean heavily on Ricardo to keep the conversation productive\nWe would like a call set up with Ricardo for him to meet the Alpharetta leadership team and to review expectations.\n Here are a few times that will work for us:\nJune 24 at 12:00 or 12:30 PM CT\nJune 25 at 12:30 PM CT\nJune 26 at 12:00 or12:30 PM CT\nJuly 10 at 1 or 1:30 PM CT\nAisha will be providing the session times by the end of next week, but please plan for the first session to start at around 8:00 AM ET and the last session to end around 4:30/5:00 PM ET on Wednesday. We recommend that Ricardo fly in the night before for the first session. \nCouple of reminders:\nSince the bulk of the participants are DL employees, they may be late to the session, so to ensure that we are not rushing through content, we are allowing for \na 15 minute buffer \nafter each session so that we can cover all the important points with as many people as possible. Aisha will schedule accordingly for this.\nLCW will provide the \u201cIntent vs. Impact\u201d slide as a handout for all participants \u2013 240 copies for the 240 participants/attendees\n\u00a0\nGlad to see the progress that we are making on this Spotlight on the Hispanic/Latino Community session.

If so I\u2019d like to gently push back\u2026\n\u00a0\nWe also discussed as a team, and we prefer Option 1 as it more closely reflects what we teach. I see a few things I would change in Option 2 \u2013 in \u201cUnderstand\u201d there is the term \u201ccultural environment\u201d and then \u201ccultural community\u201d and those two terms used together like that might be confusing. In \u201cAccept\u201d I would not use the term \u201cbiased\u201d as it is very negatively connotated and I would predict folks would raise their hands and say \u201cI\u2019m not biased!\u201d. For \u201cAdapt\u201d we thought that the language in Option 1 was simpler.\n\u00a0\nOverall, we recommend using Option 1. In addition, reading them over again, side by side, I would also recommend that we add in \u201cUnderstand\u201d, for the second bullet, after \u201cshaped my own identity,\u201d \u201cbased on the communities I have been a part of.\u201d\u00a0 \n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\nEager to hear your thoughts on this so we can get this content locked down!

The initial change request from Aisha was that we make the language more accessible by not using words like mitigate\u2014which I supplied some alternative language that is more accessible. So the request was not to change the questions to statements. The current format is wordy and does not present as well as it did in the question format, which was more visually appealing. \n\u00a0\nAlso, this format now has markers of comments on it, can you remove them? I have one example below \u2013 I see them on other slides as well.

This was supposed to be an interactive activity where we ask participants to reflect on one of the questions on the screen and provide a response on how they will answer the questions listed. \nSlide 16 has an extra space in the first statement between colleagues and may.\nNeed to have periods after all the sentences for consistency.\n\u00a0\n@Vince Bongiovanni\n to your question in the separate chain \u2013 we will share information on timing of the sessions once the deck is approved and signed off after review with the Alpharetta leadership team.\n\u00a0\nKind regards,\n\u00a0\nHollina Ung\nPrincipal DE&I Consultant\nDiversity, Equity and Inclusion\nShe / Her / Hers\nChicago, IL \nhollina.ung@bsci.com\nwww.bostonscientific.com\n\u00a0\u00a0 \n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\nFrom:\n Patricia Coleman <\np.coleman@lcwmail.com\n> \nSent:\n Friday, May 31, 2024 6:12 AM\nTo:\n Ung, Hollina (she/her/hers) <\nHollina.Ung@bsci.com\n>\nCc:\n Sarah Nodarse <\nsarah@lcwmail.com\n>; Vince Bongiovanni <\nv.bongiovanni@lcwmail.com\n>\nSubject:\n {External} Formatted deck & confirmation of Alpharetta Spotlights Scheduling\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\nCAUTION\n: This email originated from outside of the organization.

To recap the changes that we would like to see regarding timing and the other items that we talked about:\nSlide 14 should be shortened to 2-3 minutes rather than the 8 outlined in speaker notes\nSlide 18 should be lengthened to pick up the 5 minutes from slide 14\n, to 8 minutes total so that we hear more people share what actions they are gong to be taking \nCall out on not going down the rabbit hole on slide 12 with the role-play \u2013 will lean heavily on Ricardo to keep the conversation productive\nWe would like a call set up with Ricardo for him to meet the Alpharetta leadership team and to review expectations.\n Here are a few times that will work for us:\nJune 24 at 12:00 or 12:30 PM CT\nJune 25 at 12:30 PM CT\nJune 26 at 12:00 or12:30 PM CT\nJuly 10 at 1 or 1:30 PM CT\nAisha will be providing the session times by the end of next week, but please plan for the first session to start at around 8:00 AM ET and the last session to end around 4:30/5:00 PM ET on Wednesday. We recommend that Ricardo fly in the night before for the first session. \nCouple of reminders:\nSince the bulk of the participants are DL employees, they may be late to the session, so to ensure that we are not rushing through content, we are allowing for \na 15 minute buffer \nafter each session so that we can cover all the important points with as many people as possible. Aisha will schedule accordingly for this.\nLCW will provide the \u201cIntent vs. Impact\u201d slide as a handout for all participants \u2013 240 copies for the 240 participants/attendees\n\u00a0\nGlad to see the progress that we are making on this Spotlight on the Hispanic/Latino Community session.

Be Security Conscious! \n\u00a0\nHi team,\n\u00a0\nJust checking in on this, I am pasting below the two options we had for simplified language for slide 13 \u2013 these are in the 4.12 Sharepoint deck, the one I downloaded to make the final version for signoff.\n\u00a0\nHollina, can you confirm that Option 2 was the one you proposed? If so I\u2019d like to gently push back\u2026\n\u00a0\nWe also discussed as a team, and we prefer Option 1 as it more closely reflects what we teach. I see a few things I would change in Option 2 \u2013 in \u201cUnderstand\u201d there is the term \u201ccultural environment\u201d and then \u201ccultural community\u201d and those two terms used together like that might be confusing. In \u201cAccept\u201d I would not use the term \u201cbiased\u201d as it is very negatively connotated and I would predict folks would raise their hands and say \u201cI\u2019m not biased!\u201d. For \u201cAdapt\u201d we thought that the language in Option 1 was simpler.\n\u00a0\nOverall, we recommend using Option 1. In addition, reading them over again, side by side, I would also recommend that we add in \u201cUnderstand\u201d, for the second bullet, after \u201cshaped my own identity,\u201d \u201cbased on the communities I have been a part of.\u201d\u00a0 \n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\nEager to hear your thoughts on this so we can get this content locked down!

The initial change request from Aisha was that we make the language more accessible by not using words like mitigate\u2014which I supplied some alternative language that is more accessible. So the request was not to change the questions to statements. The current format is wordy and does not present as well as it did in the question format, which was more visually appealing. \n\u00a0\nAlso, this format now has markers of comments on it, can you remove them? I have one example below \u2013 I see them on other slides as well. Also there is a slide listed as a poll, when we have no planned polls for the session \u2013 can you remove that?\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\nKind regards,\n\u00a0\nHollina Ung\nPrincipal DE&I Consultant\nDiversity, Equity and Inclusion\nShe / Her / Hers\nChicago, IL \nhollina.ung@bsci.com\nwww.bostonscientific.com\n\u00a0\u00a0 \n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\nFrom:\n Sarah Nodarse <\ns.nodarse@lcwmail.com\n> \nSent:\n Tuesday, June 4, 2024 8:36 AM\nTo:\n Ung, Hollina (she/her/hers) <\nHollina.Ung@bsci.com\n>; Patricia Coleman <\np.coleman@lcwmail.com\n>; Vince Bongiovanni <\nv.bongiovanni@lcwmail.com\n>\nCc:\n Bird, Shani (she/her/hers) <\nShani.Bird@bsci.com\n>; Chan, Bethany (she/her/hers) <\nBethany.Chan@bsci.com\n>\nSubject:\n RE: {External} Formatted deck & confirmation of Alpharetta Spotlights Scheduling\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\nCAUTION\n: This email originated from outside of the organization.

This was supposed to be an interactive activity where we ask participants to reflect on one of the questions on the screen and provide a response on how they will answer the questions listed. \nSlide 16 has an extra space in the first statement between colleagues and may.\nNeed to have periods after all the sentences for consistency.\n\u00a0\n@Vince Bongiovanni\n to your question in the separate chain \u2013 we will share information on timing of the sessions once the deck is approved and signed off after review with the Alpharetta leadership team.\n\u00a0\nKind regards,\n\u00a0\nHollina Ung\nPrincipal DE&I Consultant\nDiversity, Equity and Inclusion\nShe / Her / Hers\nChicago, IL \nhollina.ung@bsci.com\nwww.bostonscientific.com\n\u00a0\u00a0 \n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\nFrom:\n Patricia Coleman <\np.coleman@lcwmail.com\n> \nSent:\n Friday, May 31, 2024 6:12 AM\nTo:\n Ung, Hollina (she/her/hers) <\nHollina.Ung@bsci.com\n>\nCc:\n Sarah Nodarse <\nsarah@lcwmail.com\n>; Vince Bongiovanni <\nv.bongiovanni@lcwmail.com\n>\nSubject:\n {External} Formatted deck & confirmation of Alpharetta Spotlights Scheduling\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\nCAUTION\n: This email originated from outside of the organization.

    "body": "Hi Sarah,\n\u00a0\nAs discussed during our call earlier today, this deck is approved to be translated into Spanish. To recap the changes that we would like to see regarding timing and the other items that we talked about:\nSlide 14 should be shortened to 2-3 minutes rather than the 8 outlined in speaker notes\nSlide 18 should be lengthened to pick up the 5 minutes from slide 14\n, to 8 minutes total so that we hear more people share what actions they are gong to be taking \nCall out on not going down the rabbit hole on slide 12 with the role-play \u2013 will lean heavily on Ricardo to keep the conversation productive\nWe would like a call set up with Ricardo for him to meet the Alpharetta leadership team and to review expectations.\n Here are a few times that will work for us:\nJune 24 at 12:00 or 12:30 PM CT\nJune 25 at 12:30 PM CT\nJune 26 at 12:00 or12:30 PM CT\nJuly 10 at 1 or 1:30 PM CT\nAisha will be providing the session times by the end of next week, but please plan for the first session to start at around 8:00 AM ET and the last session to end around 4:30/5:00 PM ET on Wednesday. We recommend that Ricardo fly in the night before for the first session. \nCouple of reminders:\nSince the bulk of the participants are DL employees, they may be late to the session, so to ensure that we are not rushing through content, we are allowing for \na 15 minute buffer \nafter each session so that we can cover all the important points with as many people as possible. Aisha will schedule accordingly for this.\nLCW will provide the \u201cIntent vs. Impact\u201d slide as a handout for all participants \u2013 240 copies for the 240 participants/attendees\n\u00a0\nGlad to see the progress that we are making on this Spotlight on the Hispanic/Latino Community session.

In \u201cAccept\u201d I would not use the term \u201cbiased\u201d as it is very negatively connotated and I would predict folks would raise their hands and say \u201cI\u2019m not biased!\u201d. For \u201cAdapt\u201d we thought that the language in Option 1 was simpler.\n\u00a0\nOverall, we recommend using Option 1. In addition, reading them over again, side by side, I would also recommend that we add in \u201cUnderstand\u201d, for the second bullet, after \u201cshaped my own identity,\u201d \u201cbased on the communities I have been a part of.\u201d\u00a0 \n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\nEager to hear your thoughts on this so we can get this content locked down!

The initial change request from Aisha was that we make the language more accessible by not using words like mitigate\u2014which I supplied some alternative language that is more accessible. So the request was not to change the questions to statements. The current format is wordy and does not present as well as it did in the question format, which was more visually appealing. \n\u00a0\nAlso, this format now has markers of comments on it, can you remove them? I have one example below \u2013 I see them on other slides as well. Also there is a slide listed as a poll, when we have no planned polls for the session \u2013 can you remove that?\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\nKind regards,\n\u00a0\nHollina Ung\nPrincipal DE&I Consultant\nDiversity, Equity and Inclusion\nShe / Her / Hers\nChicago, IL \nhollina.ung@bsci.com\nwww.bostonscientific.com\n\u00a0\u00a0 \n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\nFrom:\n Sarah Nodarse <\ns.nodarse@lcwmail.com\n> \nSent:\n Tuesday, June 4, 2024 8:36 AM\nTo:\n Ung, Hollina (she/her/hers) <\nHollina.Ung@bsci.com\n>; Patricia Coleman <\np.coleman@lcwmail.com\n>; Vince Bongiovanni <\nv.bongiovanni@lcwmail.com\n>\nCc:\n Bird, Shani (she/her/hers) <\nShani.Bird@bsci.com\n>; Chan, Bethany (she/her/hers) <\nBethany.Chan@bsci.com\n>\nSubject:\n RE: {External} Formatted deck & confirmation of Alpharetta Spotlights Scheduling\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\nCAUTION\n: This email originated from outside of the organization.

Sarah should be able to add it to our SP. I\u2019d like to see these changes made before presenting this to the Alpharetta leadership team:\nSlide 4 has extra spaces in the sentence about using laptop for notes \u2013 before laptop, at the beginning of the sentence and after laptop\nMissing a comma after, learn \u2013 for listen to learn, not judge\nSlide 8 refers to Latinx \u2013 we need to consistently use Hispanic/Latino across the presentation\nSlide 11 \u2013 for the purposes of the audience and to use more straightforward and plain language, further simplifying the first bullet point to \u201cRecognize that it is best practice for work-related interactions to be conducted in English\u201d\nSlide 13 is the wrong slide. This was supposed to be an interactive activity where we ask participants to reflect on one of the questions on the screen and provide a response on how they will answer the questions listed. \nSlide 16 has an extra space in the first statement between colleagues and may.\nNeed to have periods after all the sentences for consistency.\n\u00a0\n@Vince Bongiovanni\n to your question in the separate chain \u2013 we will share information on timing of the sessions once the deck is approved and signed off after review with the Alpharetta leadership team.\n\u00a0\nKind regards,\n\u00a0\nHollina Ung\nPrincipal DE&I Consultant\nDiversity, Equity and Inclusion\nShe / Her / Hers\nChicago, IL \nhollina.ung@bsci.com\nwww.bostonscientific.com\n\u00a0\u00a0 \n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\nFrom:\n Patricia Coleman <\np.coleman@lcwmail.com\n> \nSent:\n Friday, May 31, 2024 6:12 AM\nTo:\n Ung, Hollina (she/her/hers) <\nHollina.Ung@bsci.com\n>\nCc:\n Sarah Nodarse <\nsarah@lcwmail.com\n>; Vince Bongiovanni <\nv.bongiovanni@lcwmail.com\n>\nSubject:\n {External} Formatted deck & confirmation of Alpharetta Spotlights Scheduling\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\nCAUTION\n: This email originated from outside of the organization.

Be Security Conscious! \n\u00a0\nHi team,\n\u00a0\nJust checking in on this, I am pasting below the two options we had for simplified language for slide 13 \u2013 these are in the 4.12 Sharepoint deck, the one I downloaded to make the final version for signoff.\n\u00a0\nHollina, can you confirm that Option 2 was the one you proposed? If so I\u2019d like to gently push back\u2026\n\u00a0\nWe also discussed as a team, and we prefer Option 1 as it more closely reflects what we teach. I see a few things I would change in Option 2 \u2013 in \u201cUnderstand\u201d there is the term \u201ccultural environment\u201d and then \u201ccultural community\u201d and those two terms used together like that might be confusing. In \u201cAccept\u201d I would not use the term \u201cbiased\u201d as it is very negatively connotated and I would predict folks would raise their hands and say \u201cI\u2019m not biased!\u201d. For \u201cAdapt\u201d we thought that the language in Option 1 was simpler.\n\u00a0\nOverall, we recommend using Option 1.

The initial change request from Aisha was that we make the language more accessible by not using words like mitigate\u2014which I supplied some alternative language that is more accessible. So the request was not to change the questions to statements. The current format is wordy and does not present as well as it did in the question format, which was more visually appealing. \n\u00a0\nAlso, this format now has markers of comments on it, can you remove them? I have one example below \u2013 I see them on other slides as well. Also there is a slide listed as a poll, when we have no planned polls for the session \u2013 can you remove that?\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\nKind regards,\n\u00a0\nHollina Ung\nPrincipal DE&I Consultant\nDiversity, Equity and Inclusion\nShe / Her / Hers\nChicago, IL \nhollina.ung@bsci.com\nwww.bostonscientific.com\n\u00a0\u00a0 \n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\nFrom:\n Sarah Nodarse <\ns.nodarse@lcwmail.com\n> \nSent:\n Tuesday, June 4, 2024 8:36 AM\nTo:\n Ung, Hollina (she/her/hers) <\nHollina.Ung@bsci.com\n>; Patricia Coleman <\np.coleman@lcwmail.com\n>; Vince Bongiovanni <\nv.bongiovanni@lcwmail.com\n>\nCc:\n Bird, Shani (she/her/hers) <\nShani.Bird@bsci.com\n>; Chan, Bethany (she/her/hers) <\nBethany.Chan@bsci.com\n>\nSubject:\n RE: {External} Formatted deck & confirmation of Alpharetta Spotlights Scheduling\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\nCAUTION\n: This email originated from outside of the organization.

This was supposed to be an interactive activity where we ask participants to reflect on one of the questions on the screen and provide a response on how they will answer the questions listed. \nSlide 16 has an extra space in the first statement between colleagues and may.\nNeed to have periods after all the sentences for consistency.\n\u00a0\n@Vince Bongiovanni\n to your question in the separate chain \u2013 we will share information on timing of the sessions once the deck is approved and signed off after review with the Alpharetta leadership team.\n\u00a0\nKind regards,\n\u00a0\nHollina Ung\nPrincipal DE&I Consultant\nDiversity, Equity and Inclusion\nShe / Her / Hers\nChicago, IL \nhollina.ung@bsci.com\nwww.bostonscientific.com\n\u00a0\u00a0 \n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\nFrom:\n Patricia Coleman <\np.coleman@lcwmail.com\n> \nSent:\n Friday, May 31, 2024 6:12 AM\nTo:\n Ung, Hollina (she/her/hers) <\nHollina.Ung@bsci.com\n>\nCc:\n Sarah Nodarse <\nsarah@lcwmail.com\n>; Vince Bongiovanni <\nv.bongiovanni@lcwmail.com\n>\nSubject:\n {External} Formatted deck & confirmation of Alpharetta Spotlights Scheduling\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\nCAUTION\n: This email originated from outside of the organization.

Be Security Conscious! \n\u00a0\nHi team,\n\u00a0\nJust checking in on this, I am pasting below the two options we had for simplified language for slide 13 \u2013 these are in the 4.12 Sharepoint deck, the one I downloaded to make the final version for signoff.\n\u00a0\nHollina, can you confirm that Option 2 was the one you proposed? If so I\u2019d like to gently push back\u2026\n\u00a0\nWe also discussed as a team, and we prefer Option 1 as it more closely reflects what we teach. I see a few things I would change in Option 2 \u2013 in \u201cUnderstand\u201d there is the term \u201ccultural environment\u201d and then \u201ccultural community\u201d and those two terms used together like that might be confusing. In \u201cAccept\u201d I would not use the term \u201cbiased\u201d as it is very negatively connotated and I would predict folks would raise their hands and say \u201cI\u2019m not biased!\u201d. For \u201cAdapt\u201d we thought that the language in Option 1 was simpler.\n\u00a0\nOverall, we recommend using Option 1. In addition, reading them over again, side by side, I would also recommend that we add in \u201cUnderstand\u201d, for the second bullet, after \u201cshaped my own identity,\u201d \u201cbased on the communities I have been a part of.\u201d\u00a0 \n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\nEager to hear your thoughts on this so we can get this content locked down!

The initial change request from Aisha was that we make the language more accessible by not using words like mitigate\u2014which I supplied some alternative language that is more accessible. So the request was not to change the questions to statements. The current format is wordy and does not present as well as it did in the question format, which was more visually appealing. \n\u00a0\nAlso, this format now has markers of comments on it, can you remove them? I have one example below \u2013 I see them on other slides as well. Also there is a slide listed as a poll, when we have no planned polls for the session \u2013 can you remove that?\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\nKind regards,\n\u00a0\nHollina Ung\nPrincipal DE&I Consultant\nDiversity, Equity and Inclusion\nShe / Her / Hers\nChicago, IL \nhollina.ung@bsci.com\nwww.bostonscientific.com\n\u00a0\u00a0 \n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\nFrom:\n Sarah Nodarse <\ns.nodarse@lcwmail.com\n> \nSent:\n Tuesday, June 4, 2024 8:36 AM\nTo:\n Ung, Hollina (she/her/hers) <\nHollina.Ung@bsci.com\n>; Patricia Coleman <\np.coleman@lcwmail.com\n>; Vince Bongiovanni <\nv.bongiovanni@lcwmail.com\n>\nCc:\n Bird, Shani (she/her/hers) <\nShani.Bird@bsci.com\n>; Chan, Bethany (she/her/hers) <\nBethany.Chan@bsci.com\n>\nSubject:\n RE: {External} Formatted deck & confirmation of Alpharetta Spotlights Scheduling\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\nCAUTION\n: This email originated from outside of the organization.

Sarah should be able to add it to our SP.

This was supposed to be an interactive activity where we ask participants to reflect on one of the questions on the screen and provide a response on how they will answer the questions listed. \nSlide 16 has an extra space in the first statement between colleagues and may.\nNeed to have periods after all the sentences for consistency.\n\u00a0\n@Vince Bongiovanni\n to your question in the separate chain \u2013 we will share information on timing of the sessions once the deck is approved and signed off after review with the Alpharetta leadership team.\n\u00a0\nKind regards,\n\u00a0\nHollina Ung\nPrincipal DE&I Consultant\nDiversity, Equity and Inclusion\nShe / Her / Hers\nChicago, IL \nhollina.ung@bsci.com\nwww.bostonscientific.com\n\u00a0\u00a0 \n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\nFrom:\n Patricia Coleman <\np.coleman@lcwmail.com\n> \nSent:\n Friday, May 31, 2024 6:12 AM\nTo:\n Ung, Hollina (she/her/hers) <\nHollina.Ung@bsci.com\n>\nCc:\n Sarah Nodarse <\nsarah@lcwmail.com\n>; Vince Bongiovanni <\nv.bongiovanni@lcwmail.com\n>\nSubject:\n {External} Formatted deck & confirmation of Alpharetta Spotlights Scheduling\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\nCAUTION\n: This email originated from outside of the organization.

Be Security Conscious! \n\u00a0\nHi team,\n\u00a0\nJust checking in on this, I am pasting below the two options we had for simplified language for slide 13 \u2013 these are in the 4.12 Sharepoint deck, the one I downloaded to make the final version for signoff.\n\u00a0\nHollina, can you confirm that Option 2 was the one you proposed? If so I\u2019d like to gently push back\u2026\n\u00a0\nWe also discussed as a team, and we prefer Option 1 as it more closely reflects what we teach. I see a few things I would change in Option 2 \u2013 in \u201cUnderstand\u201d there is the term \u201ccultural environment\u201d and then \u201ccultural community\u201d and those two terms used together like that might be confusing. In \u201cAccept\u201d I would not use the term \u201cbiased\u201d as it is very negatively connotated and I would predict folks would raise their hands and say \u201cI\u2019m not biased!\u201d. For \u201cAdapt\u201d we thought that the language in Option 1 was simpler.\n\u00a0\nOverall, we recommend using Option 1. In addition, reading them over again, side by side, I would also recommend that we add in \u201cUnderstand\u201d, for the second bullet, after \u201cshaped my own identity,\u201d \u201cbased on the communities I have been a part of.\u201d\u00a0 \n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\nEager to hear your thoughts on this so we can get this content locked down!

The initial change request from Aisha was that we make the language more accessible by not using words like mitigate\u2014which I supplied some alternative language that is more accessible. So the request was not to change the questions to statements. The current format is wordy and does not present as well as it did in the question format, which was more visually appealing. \n\u00a0\nAlso, this format now has markers of comments on it, can you remove them? I have one example below \u2013 I see them on other slides as well. Also there is a slide listed as a poll, when we have no planned polls for the session \u2013 can you remove that?\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\nKind regards,\n\u00a0\nHollina Ung\nPrincipal DE&I Consultant\nDiversity, Equity and Inclusion\nShe / Her / Hers\nChicago, IL \nhollina.ung@bsci.com\nwww.bostonscientific.com\n\u00a0\u00a0 \n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\nFrom:\n Sarah Nodarse <\ns.nodarse@lcwmail.com\n> \nSent:\n Tuesday, June 4, 2024 8:36 AM\nTo:\n Ung, Hollina (she/her/hers) <\nHollina.Ung@bsci.com\n>; Patricia Coleman <\np.coleman@lcwmail.com\n>; Vince Bongiovanni <\nv.bongiovanni@lcwmail.com\n>\nCc:\n Bird, Shani (she/her/hers) <\nShani.Bird@bsci.com\n>; Chan, Bethany (she/her/hers) <\nBethany.Chan@bsci.com\n>\nSubject:\n RE: {External} Formatted deck & confirmation of Alpharetta Spotlights Scheduling\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\nCAUTION\n: This email originated from outside of the organization.

This was supposed to be an interactive activity where we ask participants to reflect on one of the questions on the screen and provide a response on how they will answer the questions listed. \nSlide 16 has an extra space in the first statement between colleagues and may.\nNeed to have periods after all the sentences for consistency.\n\u00a0\n@Vince Bongiovanni\n to your question in the separate chain \u2013 we will share information on timing of the sessions once the deck is approved and signed off after review with the Alpharetta leadership team.\n\u00a0\nKind regards,\n\u00a0\nHollina Ung\nPrincipal DE&I Consultant\nDiversity, Equity and Inclusion\nShe / Her / Hers\nChicago, IL \nhollina.ung@bsci.com\nwww.bostonscientific.com\n\u00a0\u00a0 \n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\nFrom:\n Patricia Coleman <\np.coleman@lcwmail.com\n> \nSent:\n Friday, May 31, 2024 6:12 AM\nTo:\n Ung, Hollina (she/her/hers) <\nHollina.Ung@bsci.com\n>\nCc:\n Sarah Nodarse <\nsarah@lcwmail.com\n>; Vince Bongiovanni <\nv.bongiovanni@lcwmail.com\n>\nSubject:\n {External} Formatted deck & confirmation of Alpharetta Spotlights Scheduling\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\nCAUTION\n: This email originated from outside of the organization.

Be Security Conscious! \n\u00a0\nHi team,\n\u00a0\nJust checking in on this, I am pasting below the two options we had for simplified language for slide 13 \u2013 these are in the 4.12 Sharepoint deck, the one I downloaded to make the final version for signoff.\n\u00a0\nHollina, can you confirm that Option 2 was the one you proposed? If so I\u2019d like to gently push back\u2026\n\u00a0\nWe also discussed as a team, and we prefer Option 1 as it more closely reflects what we teach. I see a few things I would change in Option 2 \u2013 in \u201cUnderstand\u201d there is the term \u201ccultural environment\u201d and then \u201ccultural community\u201d and those two terms used together like that might be confusing. In \u201cAccept\u201d I would not use the term \u201cbiased\u201d as it is very negatively connotated and I would predict folks would raise their hands and say \u201cI\u2019m not biased!\u201d. For \u201cAdapt\u201d we thought that the language in Option 1 was simpler.\n\u00a0\nOverall, we recommend using Option 1. In addition, reading them over again, side by side, I would also recommend that we add in \u201cUnderstand\u201d, for the second bullet, after \u201cshaped my own identity,\u201d \u201cbased on the communities I have been a part of.\u201d\u00a0 \n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\nEager to hear your thoughts on this so we can get this content locked down!

The initial change request from Aisha was that we make the language more accessible by not using words like mitigate\u2014which I supplied some alternative language that is more accessible. So the request was not to change the questions to statements. The current format is wordy and does not present as well as it did in the question format, which was more visually appealing. \n\u00a0\nAlso, this format now has markers of comments on it, can you remove them? I have one example below \u2013 I see them on other slides as well. Also there is a slide listed as a poll, when we have no planned polls for the session \u2013 can you remove that?\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\nKind regards,\n\u00a0\nHollina Ung\nPrincipal DE&I Consultant\nDiversity, Equity and Inclusion\nShe / Her / Hers\nChicago, IL \nhollina.ung@bsci.com\nwww.bostonscientific.com\n\u00a0\u00a0 \n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\nFrom:\n Sarah Nodarse <\ns.nodarse@lcwmail.com\n> \nSent:\n Tuesday, June 4, 2024 8:36 AM\nTo:\n Ung, Hollina (she/her/hers) <\nHollina.Ung@bsci.com\n>; Patricia Coleman <\np.coleman@lcwmail.com\n>; Vince Bongiovanni <\nv.bongiovanni@lcwmail.com\n>\nCc:\n Bird, Shani (she/her/hers) <\nShani.Bird@bsci.com\n>; Chan, Bethany (she/her/hers) <\nBethany.Chan@bsci.com\n>\nSubject:\n RE: {External} Formatted deck & confirmation of Alpharetta Spotlights Scheduling\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\nCAUTION\n: This email originated from outside of the organization.

This was supposed to be an interactive activity where we ask participants to reflect on one of the questions on the screen and provide a response on how they will answer the questions listed. \nSlide 16 has an extra space in the first statement between colleagues and may.\nNeed to have periods after all the sentences for consistency.\n\u00a0\n@Vince Bongiovanni\n to your question in the separate chain \u2013 we will share information on timing of the sessions once the deck is approved and signed off after review with the Alpharetta leadership team.\n\u00a0\nKind regards,\n\u00a0\nHollina Ung\nPrincipal DE&I Consultant\nDiversity, Equity and Inclusion\nShe / Her / Hers\nChicago, IL \nhollina.ung@bsci.com\nwww.bostonscientific.com\n\u00a0\u00a0 \n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\nFrom:\n Patricia Coleman <\np.coleman@lcwmail.com\n> \nSent:\n Friday, May 31, 2024 6:12 AM\nTo:\n Ung, Hollina (she/her/hers) <\nHollina.Ung@bsci.com\n>\nCc:\n Sarah Nodarse <\nsarah@lcwmail.com\n>; Vince Bongiovanni <\nv.bongiovanni@lcwmail.com\n>\nSubject:\n {External} Formatted deck & confirmation of Alpharetta Spotlights Scheduling\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\nCAUTION\n: This email originated from outside of the organization.

Be Security Conscious! \n\u00a0\nHi team,\n\u00a0\nJust checking in on this, I am pasting below the two options we had for simplified language for slide 13 \u2013 these are in the 4.12 Sharepoint deck, the one I downloaded to make the final version for signoff.\n\u00a0\nHollina, can you confirm that Option 2 was the one you proposed? If so I\u2019d like to gently push back\u2026\n\u00a0\nWe also discussed as a team, and we prefer Option 1 as it more closely reflects what we teach. I see a few things I would change in Option 2 \u2013 in \u201cUnderstand\u201d there is the term \u201ccultural environment\u201d and then \u201ccultural community\u201d and those two terms used together like that might be confusing. In \u201cAccept\u201d I would not use the term \u201cbiased\u201d as it is very negatively connotated and I would predict folks would raise their hands and say \u201cI\u2019m not biased!\u201d. For \u201cAdapt\u201d we thought that the language in Option 1 was simpler.\n\u00a0\nOverall, we recommend using Option 1. In addition, reading them over again, side by side, I would also recommend that we add in \u201cUnderstand\u201d, for the second bullet, after \u201cshaped my own identity,\u201d \u201cbased on the communities I have been a part of.\u201d\u00a0 \n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\nEager to hear your thoughts on this so we can get this content locked down!

The initial change request from Aisha was that we make the language more accessible by not using words like mitigate\u2014which I supplied some alternative language that is more accessible. So the request was not to change the questions to statements. The current format is wordy and does not present as well as it did in the question format, which was more visually appealing. \n\u00a0\nAlso, this format now has markers of comments on it, can you remove them? I have one example below \u2013 I see them on other slides as well. Also there is a slide listed as a poll, when we have no planned polls for the session \u2013 can you remove that?\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\nKind regards,\n\u00a0\nHollina Ung\nPrincipal DE&I Consultant\nDiversity, Equity and Inclusion\nShe / Her / Hers\nChicago, IL \nhollina.ung@bsci.com\nwww.bostonscientific.com\n\u00a0\u00a0 \n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\nFrom:\n Sarah Nodarse <\ns.nodarse@lcwmail.com\n> \nSent:\n Tuesday, June 4, 2024 8:36 AM\nTo:\n Ung, Hollina (she/her/hers) <\nHollina.Ung@bsci.com\n>; Patricia Coleman <\np.coleman@lcwmail.com\n>; Vince Bongiovanni <\nv.bongiovanni@lcwmail.com\n>\nCc:\n Bird, Shani (she/her/hers) <\nShani.Bird@bsci.com\n>; Chan, Bethany (she/her/hers) <\nBethany.Chan@bsci.com\n>\nSubject:\n RE: {External} Formatted deck & confirmation of Alpharetta Spotlights Scheduling\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\nCAUTION\n: This email originated from outside of the organization.

This was supposed to be an interactive activity where we ask participants to reflect on one of the questions on the screen and provide a response on how they will answer the questions listed. \nSlide 16 has an extra space in the first statement between colleagues and may.\nNeed to have periods after all the sentences for consistency.\n\u00a0\n@Vince Bongiovanni\n to your question in the separate chain \u2013 we will share information on timing of the sessions once the deck is approved and signed off after review with the Alpharetta leadership team.\n\u00a0\nKind regards,\n\u00a0\nHollina Ung\nPrincipal DE&I Consultant\nDiversity, Equity and Inclusion\nShe / Her / Hers\nChicago, IL \nhollina.ung@bsci.com\nwww.bostonscientific.com\n\u00a0\u00a0 \n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\nFrom:\n Patricia Coleman <\np.coleman@lcwmail.com\n> \nSent:\n Friday, May 31, 2024 6:12 AM\nTo:\n Ung, Hollina (she/her/hers) <\nHollina.Ung@bsci.com\n>\nCc:\n Sarah Nodarse <\nsarah@lcwmail.com\n>; Vince Bongiovanni <\nv.bongiovanni@lcwmail.com\n>\nSubject:\n {External} Formatted deck & confirmation of Alpharetta Spotlights Scheduling\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\nCAUTION\n: This email originated from outside of the organization.

Be Security Conscious! \n\u00a0\nHi team,\n\u00a0\nJust checking in on this, I am pasting below the two options we had for simplified language for slide 13 \u2013 these are in the 4.12 Sharepoint deck, the one I downloaded to make the final version for signoff.\n\u00a0\nHollina, can you confirm that Option 2 was the one you proposed? If so I\u2019d like to gently push back\u2026\n\u00a0\nWe also discussed as a team, and we prefer Option 1 as it more closely reflects what we teach. I see a few things I would change in Option 2 \u2013 in \u201cUnderstand\u201d there is the term \u201ccultural environment\u201d and then \u201ccultural community\u201d and those two terms used together like that might be confusing. In \u201cAccept\u201d I would not use the term \u201cbiased\u201d as it is very negatively connotated and I would predict folks would raise their hands and say \u201cI\u2019m not biased!\u201d. For \u201cAdapt\u201d we thought that the language in Option 1 was simpler.\n\u00a0\nOverall, we recommend using Option 1. In addition, reading them over again, side by side, I would also recommend that we add in \u201cUnderstand\u201d, for the second bullet, after \u201cshaped my own identity,\u201d \u201cbased on the communities I have been a part of.\u201d\u00a0 \n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\nEager to hear your thoughts on this so we can get this content locked down!

The initial change request from Aisha was that we make the language more accessible by not using words like mitigate\u2014which I supplied some alternative language that is more accessible. So the request was not to change the questions to statements. The current format is wordy and does not present as well as it did in the question format, which was more visually appealing. \n\u00a0\nAlso, this format now has markers of comments on it, can you remove them? I have one example below \u2013 I see them on other slides as well. Also there is a slide listed as a poll, when we have no planned polls for the session \u2013 can you remove that?\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\nKind regards,\n\u00a0\nHollina Ung\nPrincipal DE&I Consultant\nDiversity, Equity and Inclusion\nShe / Her / Hers\nChicago, IL \nhollina.ung@bsci.com\nwww.bostonscientific.com\n\u00a0\u00a0 \n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\nFrom:\n Sarah Nodarse <\ns.nodarse@lcwmail.com\n> \nSent:\n Tuesday, June 4, 2024 8:36 AM\nTo:\n Ung, Hollina (she/her/hers) <\nHollina.Ung@bsci.com\n>; Patricia Coleman <\np.coleman@lcwmail.com\n>; Vince Bongiovanni <\nv.bongiovanni@lcwmail.com\n>\nCc:\n Bird, Shani (she/her/hers) <\nShani.Bird@bsci.com\n>; Chan, Bethany (she/her/hers) <\nBethany.Chan@bsci.com\n>\nSubject:\n RE: {External} Formatted deck & confirmation of Alpharetta Spotlights Scheduling\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\nCAUTION\n: This email originated from outside of the organization.

Sarah should be able to add it to our SP. I\u2019d like to see these changes made before presenting this to the Alpharetta leadership team:\nSlide 4 has extra spaces in the sentence about using laptop for notes \u2013 before laptop, at the beginning of the sentence and after laptop\nMissing a comma after, learn \u2013 for listen to learn, not judge\nSlide 8 refers to Latinx \u2013 we need to consistently use Hispanic/Latino across the presentation\nSlide 11 \u2013 for the purposes of the audience and to use more straightforward and plain language, further simplifying the first bullet point to \u201cRecognize that it is best practice for work-related interactions to be conducted in English\u201d\nSlide 13 is the wrong slide. This was supposed to be an interactive activity where we ask participants to reflect on one of the questions on the screen and provide a response on how they will answer the questions listed. \nSlide 16 has an extra space in the first statement between colleagues and may.\nNeed to have periods after all the sentences for consistency.\n\u00a0\n@Vince Bongiovanni\n to your question in the separate chain \u2013 we will share information on timing of the sessions once the deck is approved and signed off after review with the Alpharetta leadership team.\n\u00a0\nKind regards,\n\u00a0\nHollina Ung\nPrincipal DE&I Consultant\nDiversity, Equity and Inclusion\nShe / Her / Hers\nChicago, IL \nhollina.ung@bsci.com\nwww.bostonscientific.com\n\u00a0\u00a0 \n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\nFrom:\n Patricia Coleman <\np.coleman@lcwmail.com\n> \nSent:\n Friday, May 31, 2024 6:12 AM\nTo:\n Ung, Hollina (she/her/hers) <\nHollina.Ung@bsci.com\n>\nCc:\n Sarah Nodarse <\nsarah@lcwmail.com\n>; Vince Bongiovanni <\nv.bongiovanni@lcwmail.com\n>\nSubject:\n {External} Formatted deck & confirmation of Alpharetta Spotlights Scheduling\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\nCAUTION\n: This email originated from outside of the organization.

The initial change request from Aisha was that we make the language more accessible by not using words like mitigate\u2014which I supplied some alternative language that is more accessible. So the request was not to change the questions to statements. The current format is wordy and does not present as well as it did in the question format, which was more visually appealing. \n\u00a0\nAlso, this format now has markers of comments on it, can you remove them? I have one example below \u2013 I see them on other slides as well. Also there is a slide listed as a poll, when we have no planned polls for the session \u2013 can you remove that?\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\nKind regards,\n\u00a0\nHollina Ung\nPrincipal DE&I Consultant\nDiversity, Equity and Inclusion\nShe / Her / Hers\nChicago, IL \nhollina.ung@bsci.com\nwww.bostonscientific.com\n\u00a0\u00a0 \n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\nFrom:\n Sarah Nodarse <\ns.nodarse@lcwmail.com\n> \nSent:\n Tuesday, June 4, 2024 8:36 AM\nTo:\n Ung, Hollina (she/her/hers) <\nHollina.Ung@bsci.com\n>; Patricia Coleman <\np.coleman@lcwmail.com\n>; Vince Bongiovanni <\nv.bongiovanni@lcwmail.com\n>\nCc:\n Bird, Shani (she/her/hers) <\nShani.Bird@bsci.com\n>; Chan, Bethany (she/her/hers) <\nBethany.Chan@bsci.com\n>\nSubject:\n RE: {External} Formatted deck & confirmation of Alpharetta Spotlights Scheduling\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\nCAUTION\n: This email originated from outside of the organization.

Sarah should be able to add it to our SP. I\u2019d like to see these changes made before presenting this to the Alpharetta leadership team:\nSlide 4 has extra spaces in the sentence about using laptop for notes \u2013 before laptop, at the beginning of the sentence and after laptop\nMissing a comma after, learn \u2013 for listen to learn, not judge\nSlide 8 refers to Latinx \u2013 we need to consistently use Hispanic/Latino across the presentation\nSlide 11 \u2013 for the purposes of the audience and to use more straightforward and plain language, further simplifying the first bullet point to \u201cRecognize that it is best practice for work-related interactions to be conducted in English\u201d\nSlide 13 is the wrong slide. This was supposed to be an interactive activity where we ask participants to reflect on one of the questions on the screen and provide a response on how they will answer the questions listed. \nSlide 16 has an extra space in the first statement between colleagues and may.\nNeed to have periods after all the sentences for consistency.\n\u00a0\n@Vince Bongiovanni\n to your question in the separate chain \u2013 we will share information on timing of the sessions once the deck is approved and signed off after review with the Alpharetta leadership team.\n\u00a0\nKind regards,\n\u00a0\nHollina Ung\nPrincipal DE&I Consultant\nDiversity, Equity and Inclusion\nShe / Her / Hers\nChicago, IL \nhollina.ung@bsci.com\nwww.bostonscientific.com\n\u00a0\u00a0 \n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\nFrom:\n Patricia Coleman <\np.coleman@lcwmail.com\n> \nSent:\n Friday, May 31, 2024 6:12 AM\nTo:\n Ung, Hollina (she/her/hers) <\nHollina.Ung@bsci.com\n>\nCc:\n Sarah Nodarse <\nsarah@lcwmail.com\n>; Vince Bongiovanni <\nv.bongiovanni@lcwmail.com\n>\nSubject:\n {External} Formatted deck & confirmation of Alpharetta Spotlights Scheduling\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\nCAUTION\n: This email originated from outside of the organization.

This was supposed to be an interactive activity where we ask participants to reflect on one of the questions on the screen and provide a response on how they will answer the questions listed. \nSlide 16 has an extra space in the first statement between colleagues and may.\nNeed to have periods after all the sentences for consistency.\n\u00a0\n@Vince Bongiovanni\n to your question in the separate chain \u2013 we will share information on timing of the sessions once the deck is approved and signed off after review with the Alpharetta leadership team.\n\u00a0\nKind regards,\n\u00a0\nHollina Ung\nPrincipal DE&I Consultant\nDiversity, Equity and Inclusion\nShe / Her / Hers\nChicago, IL \nhollina.ung@bsci.com\nwww.bostonscientific.com\n\u00a0\u00a0 \n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\nFrom:\n Patricia Coleman <\np.coleman@lcwmail.com\n> \nSent:\n Friday, May 31, 2024 6:12 AM\nTo:\n Ung, Hollina (she/her/hers) <\nHollina.Ung@bsci.com\n>\nCc:\n Sarah Nodarse <\nsarah@lcwmail.com\n>; Vince Bongiovanni <\nv.bongiovanni@lcwmail.com\n>\nSubject:\n {External} Formatted deck & confirmation of Alpharetta Spotlights Scheduling\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\nCAUTION\n: This email originated from outside of the organization.

This was supposed to be an interactive activity where we ask participants to reflect on one of the questions on the screen and provide a response on how they will answer the questions listed. \nSlide 16 has an extra space in the first statement between colleagues and may.\nNeed to have periods after all the sentences for consistency.\n\u00a0\n@Vince Bongiovanni\n to your question in the separate chain \u2013 we will share information on timing of the sessions once the deck is approved and signed off after review with the Alpharetta leadership team.\n\u00a0\nKind regards,\n\u00a0\nHollina Ung\nPrincipal DE&I Consultant\nDiversity, Equity and Inclusion\nShe / Her / Hers\nChicago, IL \nhollina.ung@bsci.com\nwww.bostonscientific.com\n\u00a0\u00a0 \n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\nFrom:\n Patricia Coleman <\np.coleman@lcwmail.com\n> \nSent:\n Friday, May 31, 2024 6:12 AM\nTo:\n Ung, Hollina (she/her/hers) <\nHollina.Ung@bsci.com\n>\nCc:\n Sarah Nodarse <\nsarah@lcwmail.com\n>; Vince Bongiovanni <\nv.bongiovanni@lcwmail.com\n>\nSubject:\n {External} Formatted deck & confirmation of Alpharetta Spotlights Scheduling\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\nCAUTION\n: This email originated from outside of the organization.

Sarah should be able to add it to our SP. I\u2019d like to see these changes made before presenting this to the Alpharetta leadership team:\nSlide 4 has extra spaces in the sentence about using laptop for notes \u2013 before laptop, at the beginning of the sentence and after laptop\nMissing a comma after, learn \u2013 for listen to learn, not judge\nSlide 8 refers to Latinx \u2013 we need to consistently use Hispanic/Latino across the presentation\nSlide 11 \u2013 for the purposes of the audience and to use more straightforward and plain language, further simplifying the first bullet point to \u201cRecognize that it is best practice for work-related interactions to be conducted in English\u201d\nSlide 13 is the wrong slide. This was supposed to be an interactive activity where we ask participants to reflect on one of the questions on the screen and provide a response on how they will answer the questions listed. \nSlide 16 has an extra space in the first statement between colleagues and may.\nNeed to have periods after all the sentences for consistency.\n\u00a0\n@Vince Bongiovanni\n to your question in the separate chain \u2013 we will share information on timing of the sessions once the deck is approved and signed off after review with the Alpharetta leadership team.\n\u00a0\nKind regards,\n\u00a0\nHollina Ung\nPrincipal DE&I Consultant\nDiversity, Equity and Inclusion\nShe / Her / Hers\nChicago, IL \nhollina.ung@bsci.com\nwww.bostonscientific.com\n\u00a0\u00a0 \n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\nFrom:\n Patricia Coleman <\np.coleman@lcwmail.com\n> \nSent:\n Friday, May 31, 2024 6:12 AM\nTo:\n Ung, Hollina (she/her/hers) <\nHollina.Ung@bsci.com\n>\nCc:\n Sarah Nodarse <\nsarah@lcwmail.com\n>; Vince Bongiovanni <\nv.bongiovanni@lcwmail.com\n>\nSubject:\n {External} Formatted deck & confirmation of Alpharetta Spotlights Scheduling\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\nCAUTION\n: This email originated from outside of the organization.

The initial change request from Aisha was that we make the language more accessible by not using words like mitigate\u2014which I supplied some alternative language that is more accessible. So the request was not to change the questions to statements. The current format is wordy and does not present as well as it did in the question format, which was more visually appealing. \n\u00a0\nAlso, this format now has markers of comments on it, can you remove them?

I am working with our partners, and expecting material from them end of next week. Ideally, I could have a few days to review their contributions and do the formatting and integration before we review together. Would that be okay? We could either schedule a special session on June 18- you can pick the time as my day is fairly open (the 19\nth\n is a holiday and I am off the 20\nth\n and 21\nst\n) or wait until our next scheduled meeting on the 26\nth\n, extending that meeting to an hour. I am confident that the materials will be excellent and that we can sign off on them by early July so that the pilots can be planned anytime after mid-July.\n\u00a0\nWe could use our meeting on the 12\nth\n to review the eLearning, which is coming along nicely. I had my 1:1 with Camille today and we spoke about the video script, I told her she could contact me directly if she needs help with it.\n\u00a0\nLet me know your thoughts \u2013 thank you!\nSarah\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\nFrom:\n Chan, Bethany (she/her/hers) <\nBethany.Chan@bsci.com\n> \nSent:\n Friday, May 24, 2024 11:23 AM\nTo:\n Sarah Nodarse <\ns.nodarse@lcwmail.com\n>\nCc:\n Bird, Shani (she/her/hers) <\nShani.Bird@bsci.com\n>\nSubject:\n RE: {External} Regionalization update\n\u00a0\nHi Sarah,\n\u00a0\nWhat a great lineup! Thank you for the update. I like the idea of adding time to the June 12\nth\n to allow time to go deeper into that. Can you add Shani to that meeting invite if she isn\u2019t already on it when you update the length? It would be wonderful to have her perspective and introduction as well if she\u2019s available. Let me know what timing would work best for Brian for a separate timing as well. I\u2019m happy to meet later in the day or as early as 7 am if needed.\n\u00a0\nFor the eLearning - I\u2019m reviewing the script you sent as well and working on arranging studio time for Camille. Will keep you posted on that.\n\u00a0\nHope you have a wonderful long weekend ahead!\n\u00a0\nBethany\n\u00a0\nBethany Chan, Ph.D.\nPrincipal DE&I L&D Specialist\nEnterprise Talent Management\nPronouns: (she/her/hers)\nbethany.chan@bsci.com\n4100 Hamline Ave N\nArden Hills, MN\nwww.bostonscientific.com\n\u00a0\u00a0 \n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\nFrom:\n Sarah Nodarse <\ns.nodarse@lcwmail.com\n> \nSent:\n Friday, May 24, 2024 11:04 AM\nTo:\n Chan, Bethany (she/her/hers) <\nBethany.Chan@bsci.com\n>\nSubject:\n {External} Regionalization update\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\nCAUTION\n: This email originated from outside of the organization.

Be Security Conscious! \n\u00a0\nHi Bethany \u2013 before I sign off for the holiday weekend I wanted to let you know what progress we\u2019ve made on the regionalization. We been busy securing the local talent who will help us and are very happy with the lineup: \nFor APAC: Brian Schroeder, who is a longtime LCW associate who lives in Hong Kong. He has already delivered facilitation for BSC and is familiar with Leading Inclusively. \nLATAM: Adriana Medina, another longtime LCW associate who is Mexican, a Ph.D. interculturalist and experienced trainer\nCANADA: Latoya Ming, a fantastic intercultural and management consultant who lives in Toronto and who is working with LCW on several projects at the moment (she is also going to be my co-facilitator for the Maple Grove workshop)\n\u00a0\nWe are still working on AUS-NZ. I am meeting with each of the three listed above on Tuesday, they have already been briefed on the assignment. The next step would be for you to meet them (perhaps Adriana and Latoya could come to the Wednesday 5-29 meeting? We might need a separate time for Brian due to time zone) and for them to produce the slides quickly. I am going to aim to have the regionalized \u00a0versions ready for us to review at our bi-weekly meeting on June 12. We could even extend this meeting if you would like. That way, we still have the opportunity to schedule pilots before the July 4 holiday.\n\u00a0\nLet me know how that sounds! \n\u00a0\nTalk to you next week,\nSarah\n\u00a0\nSarah Nodarse\n(she/her)\nPrincipal Consultant\nLCW\n4753 N Broadway, Flr. 2\nChicago, IL 60640\n\u00a0\n773-828-6781 (office)\n773-474-9138 (direct)\ns.nodarse@lcwmail.com\n\u00a0\nWebsite | Twitter | Facebook | LinkedIn\nView our upcoming events | Sign-up for our newsletter\n\u00a0\nI live and work in Chicago, IL \u2013 on the unceded territory of the Pokagon band of Potawatomi.
