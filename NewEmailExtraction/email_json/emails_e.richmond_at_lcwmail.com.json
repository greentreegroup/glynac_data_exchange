Emani\u2019s last day with us will be Oct. 16. Dustin\u2019s will be Oct. 13. We are working with Dustin to reserve some of his time for servicing Diligent and supporting LCW on contract.\n\u00a0\nIn the almost 2 \u00bd years that Emani has been with us, she has proven to be a brilliant contributor to the consulting team. As an AC she could be counted on to consistently provide senior consultants and clients with excellent support. Her advocacy for wellness contributed to policy changes here and she is the most pleasant person you can hope to ever meet. As a consultant she performed her role with competence, grace, and charm. She will be missed around here.\n\u00a0\nDustin\u2019s 6 \u00bd year here have seen him expertly fulfill many roles with aplomb. He brought a sophistication and professionalism to our multimedia efforts, managing complex audio/video shoots and building our capabilities in elearning customization. Dustin could always be counted on to give you to guide you to the best solution. His desire to wow our clients by doing the extra step or thinking outside of the box was a value add to LCW.\n\u00a0\nWe have been working to transition Emani\u2019s work over the past week. We will communicate Dustin\u2019s arrangement later this week.\n\u00a0\nJoin me in wishing the two of them the best on the next chapters of their careers.\n\u00a0\nChuck\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\nChuck Adams\n \n(He/Him)\nCo-CEO and Managing Principal\nLCW\nOffice: \n+1.773.938.4285\nMobile: +1.630.373.5068\n\u00a0\nWebsite\n\u00a0\n|\n\u00a0\nTwitter\n \n|\n\u00a0\nFacebook\n\u00a0\n|\n\u00a0\nLinkedIn\nView our upcoming events\n | \nSign-up for our newsletter",

After collaborating with the LCW team last week we were able to compile each of the needed Discussion/ Participant guides, eLearning links, and subsequent materials to complete the deliverables for the 2023-2024 DEI programming we have slated for you folks.\n\u00a0\nPlease take your time reviewing the materials, my only ask is that you open each link to double check they are exactly what you need and please download and save any file I have sent because the DropBox Transfer links expire after a certain date that I am not able to extend. \n\u00a0\nThis link will direct you to the presentation I walked you through about a week ago. \nhttps://www.dropbox.com/t/r9yNj289lqigB4Jf\n\u00a0\nThe presentation details:\n-\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \nThe DEI Programming we completed last year\n-\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \nOur deliverables for 2023-2024\n-\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \nAnd a rollout schedule\n\u00a0\nHere is the tentative rollout schedule I have organized for CHL. I mention that this timeline is tentative because after you rollout the eLearning internally folks may want a few extra weeks to complete it or continue discussions internally before the next activity is moved forward. \n\u00a0\nNovember\nProject Kickoff; reminder of DEI activities completed last year (using supporting presentation linked above)\nRefresher-Self-Directed eLearning: Introduction to Managing Unconscious Bias (IMUB)\nSet Intercultural Competence goals \nas individuals and a staff\nDecember\nToolkit: Leader-Led IMUB Discussion Guide\nLink to Dropbox Transfer file so you can access the Discussion Guide\nhttps://www.dropbox.com/t/sZVx9WKyFOlw3elU\nToolkit discussion during Monthly All-Staff\nJanuary\nSelf-Directed eLearning: \nManaging with Intercultural Competence \n(20 minutes)\neLearning module to be completed before next All-Staff\nFebruary\nFacilitated Workshop: \nUnderstanding Microaggressions \nWorkshop (2 hours) \nWe will be in contact with you in December about getting this training date on the calendar\nMarch\nDebrief learnings from Understanding Microaggressions Workshop\nToolkit: \nPost IDI- Debrief Accountability Plan\nAttached to email named \u2018Post IDI- Debrief- Accountability Plan\u2026\u2019\nApril + Ongoing\nDiscuss progress made towards the Post IDI- Debrief Accountability Plan\nIDI Assessment \nas needed for new staff(30 min)\n\u00a0\neLearning Links:\n\u00a0\nIMUB- Introduction to Managing Unconscious Bias \u2013 \nhttps://app.cloud.scorm.com/sc/InvitationConfirmEmail?publicInvitationId=dd5f28b9-f9fe-4b63-9fd1-d5c1e02d1967\n\u00a0\nMIC- Managing with Intercultural Competence \u2013 \nhttps://app.cloud.scorm.com/sc/InvitationConfirmEmail?publicInvitationId=d391aab2-1abf-4696-87da-dff7cef7bbff\n\u00a0\nThe links are active until March 31\nst\n so your staff can retake them as much as they would like between now and then\nWhen logging in participants will be asked to include their \nemail address\n and their \nname\n, that is how participation is tracked\nYou have purchased 20 seats to each eLearning, so once 20 unique users log in the links will no longer be active\nYou can request a status update from us at any time to track the status of completion for the staff\n\u00a0\nI think that sums up the whole kitchen sink!

When conducted properly, they are able to draw participants in, engage them and excite them for what comes next. Icebreakers also serve to provide reflection and a deeper introduction to the content of the workshops. As the holidays approach with the hustle and bustle of the season, let\u2019s convene for some fun and to learn best practices to conduct and debrief icebreakers, especially in a virtual setting. What works, what doesn\u2019t?

    "body": "TikTok's latest obsession, ashwagandha, is credited with improving sleep and reducing stress.\nView this email in your browser.\n\u00a0\nPresented by CVS Health\nDoes ashwagandha really help with sleep?\nOctober 12, 2023\n\u200a\nIf social media had its way, your medicine cabinet would be overflowing with supplements. TikTok\u2019s latest must-have: ashwagandha. The herb is credited with \nboosting energy and focus\n, improving \nsleep\n, and reducing stress. Research says it may live up to some of the hype.\n \nWhat is ashwagandha?\nA mainstay of Ayurvedic medicine\u2014an ancient Indian holistic healing system\u2014ashwagandha is made from a shrub found in India and Africa that is formulated into teas, powders, and capsules. Ashwagandha is considered an adaptogen\u2014a plant substance that helps regulate cortisol, which, in turn, can reduce the body\u2019s stress response. \nWhat are the benefits?\nThe most solid research around ashwagandha shows that it can reduce your body's stress response, help ease anxiety, and \nimprove brain function\n.\n\u00a0\nDoes ashwagandha improve sleep?\nDespite how commonly the supplement is used for sleep, there\u2019s not a lot of evidence to show that it helps. A study of just 50 adults found that taking ashwagandha every day for 12 weeks improved sleep. Another 2019 study found that a twice-daily dose of ashwagandha led to a reduction in anxiety and improved sleep. \nIf stress or mild anxiety is getting in between you and sleep, ashwagandha could be helpful in reducing anxiety, which may facilitate a better night\u2019s rest\u2014at least according to this limited research.\nHow much ashwagandha is safe to take?\nUp to about 500 milligrams per day is considered safe for most adults, according to the Cleveland Clinic, but the dosage depends on what form you\u2019re taking it in and what you\u2019re taking it for. As with all supplements, it\u2019s best to check with your doctor, who can help you sidestep potential drug interactions, and recommend the right dose or an alternative.\nWhat are the side effects of ashwagandha?\n \nThough ashwagandha is generally safe for most adults, according the NIH, it can cause side effects including diarrhea, drowsiness, headache, and upset stomach.\n\u00a0\nSome people can have liver problems when taking ashwagandha, especially if they\u2019re taking it with other medications metabolized in the liver. Women who are pregnant or breastfeeding should avoid taking ashwagandha.\n\u00a0\nShould you take a supplement for sleep?\nDr. Jennifer Martin, a psychologist and immediate past president of the American Academy of Sleep Medicine does not recommend taking ashwagandha or any supplements for sleep issues. Instead, she says, people should get their \nsleep hygiene\n in order. \nGood sleep hygiene means ensuring your bedroom is dark, quiet, and \ncool\n; going to bed and waking up around the same time; cutting back on exposure to bright light before bed, and\u00a0 reducing stress that may be affecting your sleep.\n\u00a0 \nRead the full article \nhere\n.\n\u200a\nThese innovators are shaping the future of health\nFrom robotic boots to synthetic blood, \nFortune\n\u2019s annual list of health innovators highlights contributions from a wide range of fields.\n\u200a\n\u200a\n\u200a\n \n \n \n \n\u200a\n\u00a0CONTENT FROM CVS HEALTH\u00a0\n\u00a0\nSuicide Prevention and Awareness\n\u00a0\n90 percent of people who die by suicide have a potentially treatable mental health condition.

This week we\u2019re writing about a medical mystery, impostor syndrome and coffee metabolism, and we\u2019ve got our weekly \u201cjoy\u201d snack. But before that \u2026\nThis week\u2019s must-reads:\nWas it wedding jitters that were making her sick?\n Read our newest \nMedical Mystery.\nAre you suffering from impostor syndrome? \nHere\u2019s advice on\n \novercoming it.\nCalifornia isn\u2019t banning Skittles.\n But what is known as the \u201cSkittles ban\u201d does target \nfour additives.\nWhat\u2019s your coffee metabolism?\n Why some people can drink coffee \nall day long.\nMary Lou Retton has severe pneumonia.\n Here\u2019s what \nto know.\nHow to cope when there\u2019s so much bad news\nEarlier this week, I woke up feeling rested and well, with my dog quietly snoozing beside me. I felt ready to start my day.\nADVERTISEMENT\n \n \n \n\u00a0\nAnd then, I remembered. The headlines and devastating videos from the war between Israel and Gaza surfaced in my mind. The earthquake in Afghanistan. The war in Ukraine. My momentary lightness disappeared, and the anxiety of it all returned to my gut, welled up in my chest and forced my eyes shut again. I hugged my dog, wishing for a better world.\nPsychologist Lesley Alderman says her patients have consistently told her they have grown weary of bad news. They have wanted to feel like life would return to normal after years of pandemic living, only to conclude that \u201cnormal\u201d isn\u2019t what it used to be.\nAlderman has noticed that her patients are experiencing a \u201cdeficit of optimism,\u201d feeling overwhelmed and anxious about important issues far beyond their control. She called it \u201chope fatigue,\u201d and the symptoms include feeling anxious, a need to tune out or feeling like giving up.\nAlderman notes that dwelling on issues that seem unfixable can lead to an \u201canxious paralysis,\u201d but she says there is hope. She outlines eight steps to help ease your anxiety when world events \u2014 or even personal ones \u2014 are out of your control.\nTake a break from the news. \n\u201cI advise patients who are feeling depressed by the headlines to read the news just once a day, turn off alerts on their phone and, if possible, check social media sparingly.\u201d\nTake care of yourself.\n \u201cI tell my patients: You have to be in good fighting shape to cope with the current turbulence.\u201d That means boosting your resilience by sleeping, eating and exercising well and engaging in life-affirming activities.\nFocus on the present. \nGet in the habit of anchoring yourself in the here and now. Fretting about the future is not helpful.\nTry a breathing exercise.\n Take a few deep breaths. Inhale to the count of five and exhale to the count of five. It will help calm your sympathetic nervous system (the fight-or-flight response) and lower your anxiety.\nThink about your victories. \nRemind yourself of what\u2019s working well in your life \u2014 whether it\u2019s your job, friendships or something else.\nBe your own therapist.\n Ask yourself, \u201cWhat do I specifically feel hopeless about and why?\u201d Being able to put into words what\u2019s getting you down can help you feel less flooded by emotions and better able to process the information rationally.\nTake action. \nWorrying doesn\u2019t help one\u2019s mental health, but taking action does.\nJoin forces with a friend. \nPick a cause. There are hundreds of nonprofits dedicated to addressing some of the most tenacious challenges on the planet. Donate money or volunteer.\nThese steps won\u2019t ease the suffering of others or solve a geopolitical crisis or end a war. But they will help you manage your anxiety, be more present for yourself and others and, hopefully, take action to make your community better.\n\u201cLook around your community,\u201d Alderman writes. \u201cMaybe your local playground would benefit from a basketball court, or your church or synagogue could sponsor a refugee family.

In many places, fall is one of the best seasons for spending time outdoors \u2014 there\u2019s plenty of sunshine, mild temperatures and gorgeous fall foliage.\nThe typical person is outside for far fewer hours in the day than was the case generations ago, said Richard Weller, a professor of dermatology at the University of Edinburgh.\n\u201cUntil the Industrial Revolution, 150 years ago, we have lived our entire evolutionary history outdoors all day, every day,\u201d he said. \u201cWhat is abnormal is that we now spend our lives inside and briefly pop outside.\u201d\nBut exposure to daylight has been shown to help boost the body\u2019s production of vitamin D, mitigate digital eyestrain, regulate a person\u2019s circadian rhythm and increase alertness and mood.\nStepping outside in the morning, within the first few hours after waking up, is the most important signal you can send to your body\u2019s circadian clock. Depending on what time you have to get to work, the timing of a sunny morning walk may not be possible, but there\u2019s always the weekend.\nSunshine has been in the news lately because many Apple watches that count our steps and check our heart rates can now keep track of our sunlight exposure.

Please let me know if you think we should forward it to her.\n\u00a0\nThis session was literally the worst training I have ever delivered because I had prepared the material for a different audience. \nThe way to present about cultural differences in a session with mixed audience is comparing cultures, with no focus in any.\n\u00a0\nFor me, the worst thing was not the questioning, because if you present about a subject that your audience feels their expertise on the subject equals yours, you should expect questioning.\n\u00a0\nThe worst was to feel the audience believed I was offering munition to the American team to attack them. At some point, discussing racism with a high middle class white audience, I was so uncomfortable that I lost what I was saying and repeated myself like crazy. \n\u00a0\nI would like to send this also to Randall and Rebecca, because I wouldn\u00b4t like them to hear about it from somebody else, but first I would like to hear your opinion.\n\u00a0\nBest\nLucy",

our trainings in house we can deliver it in any language\nWho is attending which companies: broad ( a lot of ATL representation, many different HQs (Insight Global will be hosting them at their HQ)\nHiger Ed, folks in non-profits, Tech firms Black Bod, Delta (Sponsor) VA Tech, City representations, Google, North Western Mutual, Ulta and most of them have a leadership role within DEI and their organizations\n\u00a0\nIntroductions \nTrying to find ways to engage w/ each other and bring in the lightness fun and innocence with people \nI managed Girls Inc. of Chicago, eliciting that youthfulness and susceptibility for leading\nAK- I grew up in Chicago, a lot \n\u00a0\nWe work w/ leaders and managers understand culture and how do we succeed across cultures, being w/ companies as they are going throughout their changes, we have worked with companies that have had success\nOur examples can span different parts of the market\nThis is less than a month away, what day would you like our assistance, we bring our own differences to the conference, we are trying to get Brand Awareness\nMining conference and we hosted panels from that perspective \n\u00a0\nIt\u2019s not only helping companies and it\u2019s also helping people get better understandings of each other\nChicago Chamber of Commerce, I know Chicago so we know she\u2019s here\nFamily is Pakastani, born in in Dubai, in Memphis TN, works at the National Civil Rights Museum\nWas managing program for Girls Inc, presenting at trauma-informed approach to learning and how to work w/ other people and a position came up at the National Civil Rights Museum and will focus on community engagement\n\u00a0\nCorporate Equity center & the museum, develops programming in the historic aspects of the community and that relates to the basis of the programming at the museum creating the through line of the history of slavey and oppression how does that relate to communities and systems now and where are some of these inequities rooted \nAnd I attended the DEI Summit last year and I learned a lot and I\u2019m excited to be on the planning committee\nSounds like you have a good understanding of what this ask is\n\u00a0\n30-45 min of facilitated time | Nov 2\nnd\n & 10:15 am EST\nCan talk through case studies and the way we work w/ groups\nData or results from the work that you have done\nWe are implementing these sessions b/c \u201ccan we spend more time learning together \u201c\nPeople are engaging w/ each other and how we can uniquely support them through that challenge\nAround culture and how wen can elevate our brand to be an equitable space to work\nWe love examples that you have w/ case studies it\u2019s an opportunity where you grab people a\nSCI model this is why\u2026 through the process of having interactions and adding metrics\nCase study of learning journeys and their impact in the companies that experienced them\u2026 \nHow the engagement started \nHow the engagement was funded and sustained \nChallenges we encountered \u2026\nExamples to use ARCH program, J&J work, Heritage programming \n***What are the 3 top takeaways that will be in the session \nWe delivered on the SCI model\u2026 \nLast year the summit\u2019s focus was on data and how do we translate data to cultural shifts and we can speak to this and lead folks through this \nFolks love tools they can take away from this experience and we can potentially work long-teem w/ them \nDepending on what role you would like for us to play we can play that role \n\u00a0\nWhat would success look like in the conference so we can build our content to support the content\nTheme: We are resilient,\u00a0 \nWe understand the challenges associated with DEI work how exhausting that can be to defending Equity when people don\u2019t believe it\u2019s necessary, we hope people leave the conference w/ a greater sense of community and have more tools in their toolbelt \nHow do we restore ourselves wellness, knowledge and skills what can folks take away w/ them to move forward in the work when there\u2019s so many things working against them \n\u00a0\nTraining before this session: \nThe journey to
