Emani\u2019s last day with us will be Oct. 16. Dustin\u2019s will be Oct. 13. We are working with Dustin to reserve some of his time for servicing Diligent and supporting LCW on contract.\n\u00a0\nIn the almost 2 \u00bd years that Emani has been with us, she has proven to be a brilliant contributor to the consulting team. As an AC she could be counted on to consistently provide senior consultants and clients with excellent support. Her advocacy for wellness contributed to policy changes here and she is the most pleasant person you can hope to ever meet. As a consultant she performed her role with competence, grace, and charm. She will be missed around here.\n\u00a0\nDustin\u2019s 6 \u00bd year here have seen him expertly fulfill many roles with aplomb. He brought a sophistication and professionalism to our multimedia efforts, managing complex audio/video shoots and building our capabilities in elearning customization. Dustin could always be counted on to give you to guide you to the best solution. His desire to wow our clients by doing the extra step or thinking outside of the box was a value add to LCW.\n\u00a0\nWe have been working to transition Emani\u2019s work over the past week. We will communicate Dustin\u2019s arrangement later this week.\n\u00a0\nJoin me in wishing the two of them the best on the next chapters of their careers.\n\u00a0\nChuck\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\nChuck Adams\n \n(He/Him)\nCo-CEO and Managing Principal\nLCW\nOffice: \n+1.773.938.4285\nMobile: +1.630.373.5068\n\u00a0\nWebsite\n\u00a0\n|\n\u00a0\nTwitter\n \n|\n\u00a0\nFacebook\n\u00a0\n|\n\u00a0\nLinkedIn\nView our upcoming events\n | \nSign-up for our newsletter",

After collaborating with the LCW team last week we were able to compile each of the needed Discussion/ Participant guides, eLearning links, and subsequent materials to complete the deliverables for the 2023-2024 DEI programming we have slated for you folks.\n\u00a0\nPlease take your time reviewing the materials, my only ask is that you open each link to double check they are exactly what you need and please download and save any file I have sent because the DropBox Transfer links expire after a certain date that I am not able to extend. \n\u00a0\nThis link will direct you to the presentation I walked you through about a week ago. \nhttps://www.dropbox.com/t/r9yNj289lqigB4Jf\n\u00a0\nThe presentation details:\n-\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \nThe DEI Programming we completed last year\n-\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \nOur deliverables for 2023-2024\n-\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \nAnd a rollout schedule\n\u00a0\nHere is the tentative rollout schedule I have organized for CHL. I mention that this timeline is tentative because after you rollout the eLearning internally folks may want a few extra weeks to complete it or continue discussions internally before the next activity is moved forward. \n\u00a0\nNovember\nProject Kickoff; reminder of DEI activities completed last year (using supporting presentation linked above)\nRefresher-Self-Directed eLearning: Introduction to Managing Unconscious Bias (IMUB)\nSet Intercultural Competence goals \nas individuals and a staff\nDecember\nToolkit: Leader-Led IMUB Discussion Guide\nLink to Dropbox Transfer file so you can access the Discussion Guide\nhttps://www.dropbox.com/t/sZVx9WKyFOlw3elU\nToolkit discussion during Monthly All-Staff\nJanuary\nSelf-Directed eLearning: \nManaging with Intercultural Competence \n(20 minutes)\neLearning module to be completed before next All-Staff\nFebruary\nFacilitated Workshop: \nUnderstanding Microaggressions \nWorkshop (2 hours) \nWe will be in contact with you in December about getting this training date on the calendar\nMarch\nDebrief learnings from Understanding Microaggressions Workshop\nToolkit: \nPost IDI- Debrief Accountability Plan\nAttached to email named \u2018Post IDI- Debrief- Accountability Plan\u2026\u2019\nApril + Ongoing\nDiscuss progress made towards the Post IDI- Debrief Accountability Plan\nIDI Assessment \nas needed for new staff(30 min)\n\u00a0\neLearning Links:\n\u00a0\nIMUB- Introduction to Managing Unconscious Bias \u2013 \nhttps://app.cloud.scorm.com/sc/InvitationConfirmEmail?publicInvitationId=dd5f28b9-f9fe-4b63-9fd1-d5c1e02d1967\n\u00a0\nMIC- Managing with Intercultural Competence \u2013 \nhttps://app.cloud.scorm.com/sc/InvitationConfirmEmail?publicInvitationId=d391aab2-1abf-4696-87da-dff7cef7bbff\n\u00a0\nThe links are active until March 31\nst\n so your staff can retake them as much as they would like between now and then\nWhen logging in participants will be asked to include their \nemail address\n and their \nname\n, that is how participation is tracked\nYou have purchased 20 seats to each eLearning, so once 20 unique users log in the links will no longer be active\nYou can request a status update from us at any time to track the status of completion for the staff\n\u00a0\nI think that sums up the whole kitchen sink!

When conducted properly, they are able to draw participants in, engage them and excite them for what comes next. Icebreakers also serve to provide reflection and a deeper introduction to the content of the workshops. As the holidays approach with the hustle and bustle of the season, let\u2019s convene for some fun and to learn best practices to conduct and debrief icebreakers, especially in a virtual setting. What works, what doesn\u2019t?

    "body": "TikTok's latest obsession, ashwagandha, is credited with improving sleep and reducing stress.\nView this email in your browser.\n\u00a0\nPresented by CVS Health\nDoes ashwagandha really help with sleep?\nOctober 12, 2023\n\u200a\nIf social media had its way, your medicine cabinet would be overflowing with supplements. TikTok\u2019s latest must-have: ashwagandha. The herb is credited with \nboosting energy and focus\n, improving \nsleep\n, and reducing stress. Research says it may live up to some of the hype.\n \nWhat is ashwagandha?\nA mainstay of Ayurvedic medicine\u2014an ancient Indian holistic healing system\u2014ashwagandha is made from a shrub found in India and Africa that is formulated into teas, powders, and capsules. Ashwagandha is considered an adaptogen\u2014a plant substance that helps regulate cortisol, which, in turn, can reduce the body\u2019s stress response. \nWhat are the benefits?\nThe most solid research around ashwagandha shows that it can reduce your body's stress response, help ease anxiety, and \nimprove brain function\n.\n\u00a0\nDoes ashwagandha improve sleep?\nDespite how commonly the supplement is used for sleep, there\u2019s not a lot of evidence to show that it helps. A study of just 50 adults found that taking ashwagandha every day for 12 weeks improved sleep. Another 2019 study found that a twice-daily dose of ashwagandha led to a reduction in anxiety and improved sleep. \nIf stress or mild anxiety is getting in between you and sleep, ashwagandha could be helpful in reducing anxiety, which may facilitate a better night\u2019s rest\u2014at least according to this limited research.\nHow much ashwagandha is safe to take?\nUp to about 500 milligrams per day is considered safe for most adults, according to the Cleveland Clinic, but the dosage depends on what form you\u2019re taking it in and what you\u2019re taking it for. As with all supplements, it\u2019s best to check with your doctor, who can help you sidestep potential drug interactions, and recommend the right dose or an alternative.\nWhat are the side effects of ashwagandha?\n \nThough ashwagandha is generally safe for most adults, according the NIH, it can cause side effects including diarrhea, drowsiness, headache, and upset stomach.\n\u00a0\nSome people can have liver problems when taking ashwagandha, especially if they\u2019re taking it with other medications metabolized in the liver. Women who are pregnant or breastfeeding should avoid taking ashwagandha.\n\u00a0\nShould you take a supplement for sleep?\nDr. Jennifer Martin, a psychologist and immediate past president of the American Academy of Sleep Medicine does not recommend taking ashwagandha or any supplements for sleep issues. Instead, she says, people should get their \nsleep hygiene\n in order. \nGood sleep hygiene means ensuring your bedroom is dark, quiet, and \ncool\n; going to bed and waking up around the same time; cutting back on exposure to bright light before bed, and\u00a0 reducing stress that may be affecting your sleep.\n\u00a0 \nRead the full article \nhere\n.\n\u200a\nThese innovators are shaping the future of health\nFrom robotic boots to synthetic blood, \nFortune\n\u2019s annual list of health innovators highlights contributions from a wide range of fields.\n\u200a\n\u200a\n\u200a\n \n \n \n \n\u200a\n\u00a0CONTENT FROM CVS HEALTH\u00a0\n\u00a0\nSuicide Prevention and Awareness\n\u00a0\n90 percent of people who die by suicide have a potentially treatable mental health condition.

This week we\u2019re writing about a medical mystery, impostor syndrome and coffee metabolism, and we\u2019ve got our weekly \u201cjoy\u201d snack. But before that \u2026\nThis week\u2019s must-reads:\nWas it wedding jitters that were making her sick?\n Read our newest \nMedical Mystery.\nAre you suffering from impostor syndrome? \nHere\u2019s advice on\n \novercoming it.\nCalifornia isn\u2019t banning Skittles.\n But what is known as the \u201cSkittles ban\u201d does target \nfour additives.\nWhat\u2019s your coffee metabolism?\n Why some people can drink coffee \nall day long.\nMary Lou Retton has severe pneumonia.\n Here\u2019s what \nto know.\nHow to cope when there\u2019s so much bad news\nEarlier this week, I woke up feeling rested and well, with my dog quietly snoozing beside me. I felt ready to start my day.\nADVERTISEMENT\n \n \n \n\u00a0\nAnd then, I remembered. The headlines and devastating videos from the war between Israel and Gaza surfaced in my mind. The earthquake in Afghanistan. The war in Ukraine. My momentary lightness disappeared, and the anxiety of it all returned to my gut, welled up in my chest and forced my eyes shut again. I hugged my dog, wishing for a better world.\nPsychologist Lesley Alderman says her patients have consistently told her they have grown weary of bad news. They have wanted to feel like life would return to normal after years of pandemic living, only to conclude that \u201cnormal\u201d isn\u2019t what it used to be.\nAlderman has noticed that her patients are experiencing a \u201cdeficit of optimism,\u201d feeling overwhelmed and anxious about important issues far beyond their control. She called it \u201chope fatigue,\u201d and the symptoms include feeling anxious, a need to tune out or feeling like giving up.\nAlderman notes that dwelling on issues that seem unfixable can lead to an \u201canxious paralysis,\u201d but she says there is hope. She outlines eight steps to help ease your anxiety when world events \u2014 or even personal ones \u2014 are out of your control.\nTake a break from the news. \n\u201cI advise patients who are feeling depressed by the headlines to read the news just once a day, turn off alerts on their phone and, if possible, check social media sparingly.\u201d\nTake care of yourself.\n \u201cI tell my patients: You have to be in good fighting shape to cope with the current turbulence.\u201d That means boosting your resilience by sleeping, eating and exercising well and engaging in life-affirming activities.\nFocus on the present. \nGet in the habit of anchoring yourself in the here and now. Fretting about the future is not helpful.\nTry a breathing exercise.\n Take a few deep breaths. Inhale to the count of five and exhale to the count of five. It will help calm your sympathetic nervous system (the fight-or-flight response) and lower your anxiety.\nThink about your victories. \nRemind yourself of what\u2019s working well in your life \u2014 whether it\u2019s your job, friendships or something else.\nBe your own therapist.\n Ask yourself, \u201cWhat do I specifically feel hopeless about and why?\u201d Being able to put into words what\u2019s getting you down can help you feel less flooded by emotions and better able to process the information rationally.\nTake action. \nWorrying doesn\u2019t help one\u2019s mental health, but taking action does.\nJoin forces with a friend. \nPick a cause. There are hundreds of nonprofits dedicated to addressing some of the most tenacious challenges on the planet. Donate money or volunteer.\nThese steps won\u2019t ease the suffering of others or solve a geopolitical crisis or end a war. But they will help you manage your anxiety, be more present for yourself and others and, hopefully, take action to make your community better.\n\u201cLook around your community,\u201d Alderman writes. \u201cMaybe your local playground would benefit from a basketball court, or your church or synagogue could sponsor a refugee family.

Please let me know if you think we should forward it to her.\n\u00a0\nThis session was literally the worst training I have ever delivered because I had prepared the material for a different audience. \nThe way to present about cultural differences in a session with mixed audience is comparing cultures, with no focus in any.\n\u00a0\nFor me, the worst thing was not the questioning, because if you present about a subject that your audience feels their expertise on the subject equals yours, you should expect questioning.\n\u00a0\nThe worst was to feel the audience believed I was offering munition to the American team to attack them. At some point, discussing racism with a high middle class white audience, I was so uncomfortable that I lost what I was saying and repeated myself like crazy. \n\u00a0\nI would like to send this also to Randall and Rebecca, because I wouldn\u00b4t like them to hear about it from somebody else, but first I would like to hear your opinion.\n\u00a0\nBest\nLucy",

our trainings in house we can deliver it in any language\nWho is attending which companies: broad ( a lot of ATL representation, many different HQs (Insight Global will be hosting them at their HQ)\nHiger Ed, folks in non-profits, Tech firms Black Bod, Delta (Sponsor) VA Tech, City representations, Google, North Western Mutual, Ulta and most of them have a leadership role within DEI and their organizations\n\u00a0\nIntroductions \nTrying to find ways to engage w/ each other and bring in the lightness fun and innocence with people \nI managed Girls Inc. of Chicago, eliciting that youthfulness and susceptibility for leading\nAK- I grew up in Chicago, a lot \n\u00a0\nWe work w/ leaders and managers understand culture and how do we succeed across cultures, being w/ companies as they are going throughout their changes, we have worked with companies that have had success\nOur examples can span different parts of the market\nThis is less than a month away, what day would you like our assistance, we bring our own differences to the conference, we are trying to get Brand Awareness\nMining conference and we hosted panels from that perspective \n\u00a0\nIt\u2019s not only helping companies and it\u2019s also helping people get better understandings of each other\nChicago Chamber of Commerce, I know Chicago so we know she\u2019s here\nFamily is Pakastani, born in in Dubai, in Memphis TN, works at the National Civil Rights Museum\nWas managing program for Girls Inc, presenting at trauma-informed approach to learning and how to work w/ other people and a position came up at the National Civil Rights Museum and will focus on community engagement\n\u00a0\nCorporate Equity center & the museum, develops programming in the historic aspects of the community and that relates to the basis of the programming at the museum creating the through line of the history of slavey and oppression how does that relate to communities and systems now and where are some of these inequities rooted \nAnd I attended the DEI Summit last year and I learned a lot and I\u2019m excited to be on the planning committee\nSounds like you have a good understanding of what this ask is\n\u00a0\n30-45 min of facilitated time | Nov 2\nnd\n & 10:15 am EST\nCan talk through case studies and the way we work w/ groups\nData or results from the work that you have done\nWe are implementing these sessions b/c \u201ccan we spend more time learning together \u201c\nPeople are engaging w/ each other and how we can uniquely support them through that challenge\nAround culture and how wen can elevate our brand to be an equitable space to work\nWe love examples that you have w/ case studies it\u2019s an opportunity where you grab people a\nSCI model this is why\u2026 through the process of having interactions and adding metrics\nCase study of learning journeys and their impact in the companies that experienced them\u2026 \nHow the engagement started \nHow the engagement was funded and sustained \nChallenges we encountered \u2026\nExamples to use ARCH program, J&J work, Heritage programming \n***What are the 3 top takeaways that will be in the session \nWe delivered on the SCI model\u2026 \nLast year the summit\u2019s focus was on data and how do we translate data to cultural shifts and we can speak to this and lead folks through this \nFolks love tools they can take away from this experience and we can potentially work long-teem w/ them \nDepending on what role you would like for us to play we can play that role \n\u00a0\nWhat would success look like in the conference so we can build our content to support the content\nTheme: We are resilient,\u00a0 \nWe understand the challenges associated with DEI work how exhausting that can be to defending Equity when people don\u2019t believe it\u2019s necessary, we hope people leave the conference w/ a greater sense of community and have more tools in their toolbelt \nHow do we restore ourselves wellness, knowledge and skills what can folks take away w/ them to move forward in the work when there\u2019s so many things working against them \n\u00a0\nTraining before this session: \nThe journey to Belonging\nWhat does it mean to belong, and then we come in w/ the tools for how to get to that end state \n\u00a0\nAction Items:\nUs to receive the agenda \nSend Lori an outline of what the

w/ Ozakh \n\u00a0\nWe can talk about the conference, our background + case studies\n\u00a0\nAudience: 350 people, this is what we are seeing, we are known for our clients, we create all of our trainings in house we can deliver it in any language\nWho is attending which companies: broad ( a lot of ATL representation, many different HQs (Insight Global will be hosting them at their HQ)\nHiger Ed, folks in non-profits, Tech firms Black Bod, Delta (Sponsor) VA Tech, City representations, Google, North Western Mutual, Ulta and most of them have a leadership role within DEI and their organizations\n\u00a0\nIntroductions \nTrying to find ways to engage w/ each other and bring in the lightness fun and innocence with people \nI managed Girls Inc. of Chicago, eliciting that youthfulness and susceptibility for leading\nAK- I grew up in Chicago, a lot \n\u00a0\nWe work w/ leaders and managers understand culture and how do we succeed across cultures, being w/ companies as they are going throughout their changes, we have worked with companies that have had success\nOur examples can span different parts of the market\nThis is less than a month away, what day would you like our assistance, we bring our own differences to the conference, we are trying to get Brand Awareness\nMining conference and we hosted panels from that perspective \n\u00a0\nIt\u2019s not only helping companies and it\u2019s also helping people get better understandings of each other\nChicago Chamber of Commerce, I know Chicago so we know she\u2019s here\nFamily is Pakastani, born in in Dubai, in Memphis TN, works at the National Civil Rights Museum\nWas managing program for Girls Inc, presenting at trauma-informed approach to learning and how to work w/ other people and a position came up at the National Civil Rights Museum and will focus on community engagement\n\u00a0\nCorporate Equity center & the museum, develops programming in the historic aspects of the community and that relates to the basis of the programming at the museum creating the through line of the history of slavey and oppression how does that relate to communities and systems now and where are some of these inequities rooted \nAnd I attended the DEI Summit last year and I learned a lot and I\u2019m excited to be on the planning committee\nSounds like you have a good understanding of what this ask is\n\u00a0\n30-45 min of facilitated time | Nov 2\nnd\n & 10:15 am EST\nCan talk through case studies and the way we work w/ groups\nData or results from the work that you have done\nWe are implementing these sessions b/c \u201ccan we spend more time learning together \u201c\nPeople are engaging w/ each other and how we can uniquely support them through that challenge\nAround culture and how wen can elevate our brand to be an equitable space to work\nWe love examples that you have w/ case studies it\u2019s an opportunity where you grab people a\nSCI model this is why\u2026 through the process of having interactions and adding metrics\nCase study of learning journeys and their impact in the companies that experienced them\u2026 \nHow the engagement started \nHow the engagement was funded and sustained \nChallenges we encountered \u2026\nExamples to use ARCH program, J&J work, Heritage programming \n***What are the 3 top takeaways that will be in the session \nWe delivered on the SCI model\u2026 \nLast year the summit\u2019s focus was on data and how do we translate data to cultural shifts and we can speak to this and lead folks through this \nFolks love tools they can take away from this experience and we can potentially work long-teem w/ them \nDepending on what role you would like for us to play we can play that role \n\u00a0\nWhat would success look like in the conference so we can build our content to support the content\nTheme: We are resilient,\u00a0 \nWe understand the challenges associated with DEI work how exhausting that can be to defending Equity when people don\u2019t believe it\u2019s necessary, we hope people leave the conference w/ a greater sense of community and have more tools in their toolbelt \nHow do we restore ourselves wellness, knowledge and skills what can folks take away w/ them to move forward in the work when there\u2019s so many things working against them \n\u00a0\nTraining before this session: \nThe journey to

Please let me know if you think we should forward it to her.\n\u00a0\nThis session was literally the worst training I have ever delivered because I had prepared the material for a different audience. \nThe way to present about cultural differences in a session with mixed audience is comparing cultures, with no focus in any.\n\u00a0\nFor me, the worst thing was not the questioning, because if you present about a subject that your audience feels their expertise on the subject equals yours, you should expect questioning.\n\u00a0\nThe worst was to feel the audience believed I was offering munition to the American team to attack them. At some point, discussing racism with a high middle class white audience, I was so uncomfortable that I lost what I was saying and repeated myself like crazy. \n\u00a0\nI would like to send this also to Randall and Rebecca, because I wouldn\u00b4t like them to hear about it from somebody else, but first I would like to hear your opinion.\n\u00a0\nBest\nLucy",

After collaborating with the LCW team last week we were able to compile each of the needed Discussion/ Participant guides, eLearning links, and subsequent materials to complete the deliverables for the 2023-2024 DEI programming we have slated for you folks.\n\u00a0\nPlease take your time reviewing the materials, my only ask is that you open each link to double check they are exactly what you need and please download and save any file I have sent because the DropBox Transfer links expire after a certain date that I am not able to extend. \n\u00a0\nThis link will direct you to the presentation I walked you through about a week ago. \nhttps://www.dropbox.com/t/r9yNj289lqigB4Jf\n\u00a0\nThe presentation details:\n-\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \nThe DEI Programming we completed last year\n-\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \nOur deliverables for 2023-2024\n-\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \nAnd a rollout schedule\n\u00a0\nHere is the tentative rollout schedule I have organized for CHL.

An intercultural training aims to uncover what is hidden, making it easier to understand.\n\u00a0\nI didn\u00b4t know it was a mixed session, with Brazilians and Americans, and already at the training, I didn\u00b4t know most of the audience was made of Brazilians. \n\u00a0\nThe Brazilians there were sensitive to be the subject of the session, feeling they were observed and judged. If there are problems in this relationship, a training designed for Americans to understand cultural differences, pointing at questions that are usually reported as \u201cproblems\u201d, must have felt as giving Americans munition against Brazilians. \n\u00a0\nThe slide about CLT and At Will uncovered a difficult question as it states that there is no solution, as the law guarantees the rights of Brazilian workers. The example of the copying machine was not good for the Brazilian audience because it is a reality, it\u00b4s like putting the finger on the wound. \u00a0\n\u00a0\nThe word \u201cjeitinho\u201d is an old expression, meaning to find a way to go around a problem. \u00a0It\u00b4s at anthropological studies about the Brazilian culture meaning flexibility, with its good and dark sides.\nAt this session it represented unspoken questions. It revealed problems that were not related to the training, and it became a way to for the Brazilians to represent their dissatisfaction with the situation. \n\u00a0\nI have had many sessions for mixed audiences, but if there is tension involved, in has to be prepared in another way. \n\u00a0\nIs it possible that you send me the comments at the chat? Let\u00b4s sleep on what happened and talk again.\n\u00a0\nKisses\nLucy",

    "body": "Uber's ex-diversity chief shares lessons from the Israel-Palestine conflict in 2021.\nView this email in your browser.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\nUber\u2019s\u00a0response to the 2021 Israel-Palestine conflict is a master class for companies taking a stand on the war\nOctober 11, 2023\n\u200a\nGood afternoon.\nIt\u2019s been said time and time again that, more recently, employees expect their senior leadership to speak up about high-profile and political issues. The escalating war in Israel is the latest geopolitical conflict to find its way into corporate America.\n \nJPMorgan Chase CEO Jamie Dimon and Goldman Sachs\u2019s David Solomon are among the chief executives who\u2019ve \ncondemned the attacks\n against Israel, expressing their \nsolidarity with the country\n, and many employers have circulated internal memos to staffers addressing the matter.\n\u201cAll of us at Goldman Sachs are thinking of you and your families in the face of this shocking aggression directed at the people of Israel,\u201d Solomon told employees in a Sunday memo obtained by CNN.\nAt \nFortune\n\u2019s Most Powerful Women Summit this week, I spoke to countless Fortune 500 chief diversity and human resources officers who confirmed their companies had shared statements supporting Jewish colleagues. However, public statements appear muted as companies find themselves, yet again, navigating a relatively new terrain in which they feel moved but ill-equipped to react to all current events and human tragedy.\nCommunicating clearly and ingenuously can be challenging for leaders, who fear alienating or offending their employees and consumers if they get it wrong. But remaining silent can be read as insensitive and overly cautious, \nFortune\n\u2019s Lila MacLellan writes in a piece that offers guidance from communications experts on how businesses should respond to the humanitarian crisis in the Middle East. \u201cBe sure to acknowledge innocent lives lost and hardship on both sides,\u201d Randall Peterson, a professor of organizational behavior at London Business School, told \nFortune\n in an email. Additional guidance: Avoid sending such messages on platforms like Slack, where employees may unwittingly or intentionally foment conversation that stirs tension.\nUber\u2019s former chief diversity, equity, and inclusion officer, Bo Young Lee, shared her insight Tuesday in \na LinkedIn post\n that I think is worth sharing in full.\nIn it, Lee recounted the 2021 escalation of violence between Israel and Palestine, stating, \u201cAbout half the messages I received demanded that the company support the BDS (Boycott, Divest, Sanction) movement, while the other half demanded we stand with Israel. Interestingly, our employees who lived in the region of conflict were remarkably quiet. It was a tough situation to be in with very little space to navigate without pissing someone off.\u201d\nShe acknowledged that the dynamics in the Middle East are long-standing conflicts that even the most knowledgeable historians and peace negotiators find difficult to decipher. \u201cI wasn\u2019t arrogant to think we knew better than experts in the field.\u201d\u00a0\nAt the time, the company took four steps:\n1.\n It asked employees why they shared their concerns with the DEI function and the reactions they sought.\n2.\n It held listening sessions with employees to help them process their emotions.\n3.\n Her team contacted external experts specializing in religion in the workplace to glean what they were hearing.\n4.\n Uber created a rubric to help the company determine next steps. Core rubric questions included: Do the events affect Uber\u2019s business, employees, or partners? Will taking a stance help Uber serve its customers, earners, employees, or community stakeholders? Is this an area in which Uber has expertise? Are the suggested actions consistent with Uber\u2019s values?

An intercultural training aims to uncover what is hidden, making it easier to understand.\n\u00a0\nI didn\u00b4t know it was a mixed session, with Brazilians and Americans, and already at the training, I didn\u00b4t know most of the audience was made of Brazilians. \n\u00a0\nThe Brazilians there were sensitive to be the subject of the session, feeling they were observed and judged. If there are problems in this relationship, a training designed for Americans to understand cultural differences, pointing at questions that are usually reported as \u201cproblems\u201d, must have felt as giving Americans munition against Brazilians. \n\u00a0\nThe slide about CLT and At Will uncovered a difficult question as it states that there is no solution, as the law guarantees the rights of Brazilian workers. The example of the copying machine was not good for the Brazilian audience because it is a reality, it\u00b4s like putting the finger on the wound. \u00a0\n\u00a0\nThe word \u201cjeitinho\u201d is an old expression, meaning to find a way to go around a problem. \u00a0It\u00b4s at anthropological studies about the Brazilian culture meaning flexibility, with its good and dark sides.\nAt this session it represented unspoken questions. It revealed problems that were not related to the training, and it became a way to for the Brazilians to represent their dissatisfaction with the situation. \n\u00a0\nI have had many sessions for mixed audiences, but if there is tension involved, in has to be prepared in another way. \n\u00a0\nIs it possible that you send me the comments at the chat? Let\u00b4s sleep on what happened and talk again.\n\u00a0\nKisses\nLucy",

    "body": "Hi Ann, \n\u00a0\nI hope you are well as the team nears your HUGE fundraising event. After collaborating with the LCW team last week we were able to compile each of the needed Discussion/ Participant guides, eLearning links, and subsequent materials to complete the deliverables for the 2023-2024 DEI programming we have slated for you folks.\n\u00a0\nPlease take your time reviewing the materials, my only ask is that you open each link to double check they are exactly what you need and please download and save any file I have sent because the DropBox Transfer links expire after a certain date that I am not able to extend. \n\u00a0\nThis link will direct you to the presentation I walked you through about a week ago. \nhttps://www.dropbox.com/t/r9yNj289lqigB4Jf\n\u00a0\nThe presentation details:\n-\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \nThe DEI Programming we completed last year\n-\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \nOur deliverables for 2023-2024\n-\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \nAnd a rollout schedule\n\u00a0\nHere is the tentative rollout schedule I have organized for CHL. I mention that this timeline is tentative because after you rollout the eLearning internally folks may want a few extra weeks to complete it or continue discussions internally before the next activity is moved forward. \n\u00a0\nNovember\nProject Kickoff; reminder of DEI activities completed last year (using supporting presentation linked above)\nRefresher-Self-Directed eLearning: Introduction to Managing Unconscious Bias (IMUB)\nSet Intercultural Competence goals \nas individuals and a staff\nDecember\nToolkit: Leader-Led IMUB Discussion Guide\nLink to Dropbox Transfer file so you can access the Discussion Guide\nhttps://www.dropbox.com/t/sZVx9WKyFOlw3elU\nToolkit discussion during Monthly All-Staff\nJanuary\nSelf-Directed eLearning: \nManaging with Intercultural Competence \n(20 minutes)\neLearning module to be completed before next All-Staff\nFebruary\nFacilitated Workshop: \nUnderstanding Microaggressions \nWorkshop (2 hours) \nWe will be in contact with you in December about getting this training date on the calendar\nMarch\nDebrief learnings from Understanding Microaggressions Workshop\nToolkit: \nPost IDI- Debrief Accountability Plan\nAttached to email named \u2018Post IDI- Debrief- Accountability Plan\u2026\u2019\nApril + Ongoing\nDiscuss progress made towards the Post IDI- Debrief Accountability Plan\nIDI Assessment \nas needed for new staff(30 min)\n\u00a0\neLearning Links:\n\u00a0\nIMUB- Introduction to Managing Unconscious Bias \u2013 \nhttps://app.cloud.scorm.com/sc/InvitationConfirmEmail?publicInvitationId=dd5f28b9-f9fe-4b63-9fd1-d5c1e02d1967\n\u00a0\nMIC- Managing with Intercultural Competence \u2013 \nhttps://app.cloud.scorm.com/sc/InvitationConfirmEmail?publicInvitationId=d391aab2-1abf-4696-87da-dff7cef7bbff\n\u00a0\nThe links are active until March 31\nst\n so your staff can retake them as much as they would like between now and then\nWhen logging in participants will be asked to include their \nemail address\n and their \nname\n, that is how participation is tracked\nYou have purchased 20 seats to each eLearning, so once 20 unique users log in the links will no longer be active\nYou can request a status update from us at any time to track the status of completion for the staff\n\u00a0\nI think that sums up the whole kitchen sink! I look forward to CHL receiving this program over the next few months. \n\u00a0\nAgain, please send any questions my way.\n\u00a0\nBest,\n\u00a0\nEmani Richmond\n(she/her/hers)\nConsultant\nLCW\nWebsite\n\u00a0\n|\n\u00a0\nTwitter\n \n|\n\u00a0\nFacebook\n\u00a0\n|\n\u00a0\nLinkedIn\nView our upcoming events\n | \nSign-up for our newsletter",

I don\u2019t do it as often as I should, but I\u2019ve had cause to be grateful for the diligence of others many times over.\nWhy is this necessary? There are a few reasons. \nRefer a friend\nToxicity, Targeting and \u201cDirty Deleting\u201d\nFirst, because when we talk about racism, bigotry and discrimination we are often gaslit by people who don\u2019t understand all the nuances. They\u2019ll look at something we post, jump to the wrong conclusion about our motivation, and weigh in with ill-informed and harmful replies. Inevitably, once the first person does that, others will pile on, quickly creating a toxic and harmful space for the original creator. \nIf they get challenged, rather than be accountable, the offenders will often \u201cdirty delete\u201d their comment or post, so the harm they did can\u2019t be easily found. That leaves subsequent commenters wondering wtf is going on, and it\u2019s where screenshots help to provide the original context. \nSecond, because in that same situation, people who face isms are often targeted by those who hate them, and might end up with their content hidden or suppressed. Having the screenshots gives them an option to take it to the \u201cjury of LinkedIn\u201d so to speak - their network - and have those folx help to get the content reinstated. And having that evidence can also help others fight your corner is multiple bad-faith reports result in your account being restricted, temporarily suspended or permanently banned.\nUpgrade to paid\nThat also applies in the case of algorithmic bias, because if LinkedIn\u2019s human reviewers can\u2019t spot a dog whistle, you\u2019d better believe their automated review system can\u2019t. That often leaves the original poster having to have long discussions to get content restored, or to get harmful content banned - having screenshots is a useful tool there, too. \nScreenshots are also helpful in identifying repeat offenders targeting people who face isms. I\u2019ve lost count of the number of times someone\u2019s shared a screenshot in a chat, only to be told that the same person had been stirring up trouble on multiple people\u2019s profiles. \nSurely, There\u2019s A Better Way?\nWhile I see the usefulness of screenshotting, it\u2019s another task which takes time and emotional labour - constantly having to trawl through screenshots of people saying nasty things, being racist, being bigoted, or just being mean. And you usually experience some gaslighting as well on the posts where you have to take the screenshots.\nI\u2019d love to see platforms have better ways to handle this - to be able to pick up on dog whistles and more subtle forms of racism and bigotry, and to understand that in most cases when we report racism it exists, even if your human and AI reviewers can\u2019t see it. Maybe one day we won\u2019t need to screenshot every racist or bigot who crosses our digital path.\nTake Action\nHow can you take action today?

Netflix has a documentary titled \nCoded Bias\n, and you can also follow and support the \nAlgorithmic Justice League\n which pays attention to how inequality is perpetrated and perpetuated online. \nThanks for reading\nSharon\nLeave a comment\nEnjoyed this article?

    "body": "Open enrollment starts next week.\nView this email in your browser.\n\u00a0\nPresented by CVS Health\nHow to lower your Medicare costs during open enrollment for 2024\nOctober 10, 2023\n\u200a\nMedicare open enrollment season is approaching\u2014Oct. 15 to Dec. 7\u2014when you can join, switch, or drop a \nMedicare Part D prescription drug plan\n or a private insurer\u2019s \nMedicare Advantage\n plan for 2024. Experts say it\u2019s vitally important to explore your options carefully.\n \n\u00a0\n\u201cEvery survey I\u2019ve seen finds that year-to-year [Medicare Part D and Medicare Advantage] plan changes may offer improved coverage, lower costs, or both, to people who take the time to research next year\u2019s plan offerings,\u201d Phil Moeller noted in his Get What\u2019s Yours newsletter on Medicare, Social Security, and health care.\nHow to compare Part D and Medicare Advantage Plans\nIf you\u2019ll enroll in a Part D or Medicare Advantage plan for the first time in 2024 or might switch plans, you\u2019ll want to do some comparison shopping.\nYou could do it online, either by calling Medicare (800-MEDICARE) or through \nMedicare\u2019s Plan Finder\n tool. It lets you compare costs and coverage of various Part D and Medicare Advantage plans available where you live.\u00a0\nAlternatively, you could speak with someone at your state\u2019s \nSHIP plan\n. The State Health Insurance Assistance Programs have free, unbiased advisors who can answer open enrollment questions.\nOr you might \nhire a Medicare agent or broker\n who can suggest possible Part D and Part C plans and get paid by insurers. But be careful. The Centers for Medicare and Medicaid has reported a big rise in complaints about the marketing of Medicare Advantage and Part D plans, often due to their brokers.\n\u201cIt\u2019s a good idea to understand from that agent or broker whether they work with, or represent, all of the plans available in your area or only a subset,\u201d says Schwarz. \u201cIn some situations, you won\u2019t be presented with all the options that are available if you go through a broker.\u201d\n\u00a0\nWhen sizing up Medicare Advantage plans to see which health care providers are in their networks, Schwarz advised doing it in this order:\u00a0\nFirst, see if your primary care doctors and the specialists see regularly are in them.\u00a0\nThen, see if your hospital of choice is in network.\nFinally, look into skilled nursing facilities or long-term care rehab facilities.\n\u00a0\nIf you\u2019ll be comparing the cost of Medicare Advantage plans, don\u2019t look only at their premiums. Check too at how they differ regarding copayments, co-insurance, and annual out-of-pocket maximum.\n\u00a0\nRead the full article \nhere\n.\n\u200a\n\u200a\n \n \n \n \n\u200a\n\u00a0CONTENT FROM CVS HEALTH\u00a0\n\u00a0\nSuicide Prevention and Awareness\n\u00a0\n90 percent of people who die by suicide have a potentially treatable mental health condition.

    "body": "Monthly newsletter that pulls together the latest peer-reviewed research on workforce health and productivity\n \nIncreased Mortality Associated with Disability Among Workers' Compensation Claimants with Upper Extremity Neuropathy\nThis study of workers' compensation claimants found that among claimants diagnosed with upper extremity neuropathy, increased mortality was mainly due to unintentional injuries, suicide, and cardiometabolic conditions, especially among those with more severe neuropathy and multiple limb involvement. The findings suggest upper extremity neuropathy is an independent risk factor for premature death in this injured worker population that warrants greater clinical attention and prevention efforts to mitigate this mortality risk.\nThe Role of Discrete Emotions in Job Satisfaction\nThis meta-analysis of 235 studies (N = 99,883) found that negative emotions attributing blame to the situation like depression and anxiety had the strongest negative links to overall job satisfaction, while positive emotions attributing credit to the situation like happiness and optimism had the strongest positive links. The relationships were consistent across moderators. This nuanced understanding of how distinct work-related emotions relate to overall job satisfaction evaluations highlights the importance of contextual factors in shaping employees' attitudinal reactions.\nThe Relationship Between Stress and Sleep Sufficiency in the Context of Varied Workplace Social Support\nA survey of 2000 full-time employees found that higher stress was associated with insufficient sleep, and that the relationship between stress and sleep is moderated by supervisor and coworker support. Insufficient sleep may link stress to poor health, but the findings of this study suggest that strong workplace social support may buffer these negative impacts by promoting better sleep. Overall, the study highlights the importance of managing work stress and building supportive workplace relationships to ensure employees obtain adequate sleep.\nRecognition During the Return-to-Work Process in Workers with Common Mental Disorders\nA study of workers with common mental disorders found recognition by supervisors and coworkers was critical during the return-to-work process. Interviews and focus groups revealed social support and recognition facilitated recovery and reintegration, while lack of recognition or negative responses created barriers. Recognition was found to be tied to stakeholders' behaviors and attitudes and is influenced by work, health, insurance, and social systems that make them feel appreciated, valued, and respected. The research highlights the vital role recognition plays in enabling successful return to work after mental health-related absence. Training supervisors and fostering a supportive return-to-work environment are recommended.\n\u00a0\n+\nSupporting mental health in the workplace\n: To help employers better understand and support the mental health needs of their employees, IBI conducted an \nanalysis \nof the impact of the pandemic on mental health. According to IBI\u2019s analysis, fully remote (40%) and hybrid work (38%) is associated with an increased likelihood of anxiety and depression symptoms compared to in-person (35%). \u00a0\nRacial Differences in Perceptions of Genetic Wellness Programs\nA qualitative study of Black, White, and Asian employees found nearly all respondents saw potential benefits in workplace genetic wellness programs. However, Black respondents had profound concerns about privacy, discrimination and ethics that deterred their participation, unlike White and Asian respondents. The findings suggest genetic wellness programs could further racial health disparities unless designed to address concerns voiced by minority groups. Including diverse perspectives is key to building trust and participation in voluntary workplace genetic testing initiatives.\nThe Workplace Masking Experiences of Autistic, Non-autistic Neurodivergent and Neurotypical Adults in the UK\nIn a UK survey of autistic, non-autistic neurodivergent, and neurotypical adults, workplace masking - concealing natural behaviors to fit societal norms - was common but most prevalent among autistic adults. Key drivers included appearing professional and capable, managing interactions, and avoiding negative judgment or discrimination. Masking was linked to stress, fatigue, and poor mental wellbeing, especially for autistic people. Findings highlight the need for more open professional conduct to prevent marginalization of neurodivergent groups, better accommodations, fostering acceptance, educating colleagues, and enabling authentic self-expression.\n \n \n \n \nIntegrated Benefits Institute, 1901 Harrison Street, Suite 1100, Oakland, California 94612 \nManage preferences",

    "body": "Hello Emani\n\u00a0\nI would like to approach what just happened today and share with you my perspective.\n\u00a0\nWe prepared this training with some questions listed by Carta and others that focus on cultural differences between Americans and Brazilians, mainly the ones where the problems come from. An intercultural training aims to uncover what is hidden, making it easier to understand.\n\u00a0\nI didn\u00b4t know it was a mixed session, with Brazilians and Americans, and already at the training, I didn\u00b4t know most of the audience was made of Brazilians. \n\u00a0\nThe Brazilians there were sensitive to be the subject of the session, feeling they were observed and judged. If there are problems in this relationship, a training designed for Americans to understand cultural differences, pointing at questions that are usually reported as \u201cproblems\u201d, must have felt as giving Americans munition against Brazilians. \n\u00a0\nThe slide about CLT and At Will uncovered a difficult question as it states that there is no solution, as the law guarantees the rights of Brazilian workers. The example of the copying machine was not good for the Brazilian audience because it is a reality, it\u00b4s like putting the finger on the wound. \u00a0\n\u00a0\nThe word \u201cjeitinho\u201d is an old expression, meaning to find a way to go around a problem. \u00a0It\u00b4s at anthropological studies about the Brazilian culture meaning flexibility, with its good and dark sides.\nAt this session it represented unspoken questions. It revealed problems that were not related to the training, and it became a way to for the Brazilians to represent their dissatisfaction with the situation. \n\u00a0\nI have had many sessions for mixed audiences, but if there is tension involved, in has to be prepared in another way. \n\u00a0\nIs it possible that you send me the comments at the chat? Let\u00b4s sleep on what happened and talk again.\n\u00a0\nKisses\nLucy",

I think RP would do a much better job driving this one home than I would. I have a few outstanding questions on some others\u2026 \n\u00a0\nOn Slide 6, there is an unresolved comment from RP (that I agree with) in the chat section. Can you suggest alternate language here, or let me know if we can take it out?\n\u00a0\nUsing the chat feature: \n\u00a0- First, share the number of facts you felt like you knew. \n\u00a0- Next, share how many you thought would have changed since you first heard it. \n(RP: what does this mean?) \n\u00a0- Finally, which of those listed surprised you the most?\n\u00a0\nOn Slide 14, what is meant by \u201cMade to pay when taking parenthood leave\u201d? Do you mean that the employer assumes they\u2019ll have to pay parenthood leave? Or that the female presenting person will be made to pay because they took parenthood leave?\n\u00a0\nBased on the \nmotherhood penalty bias\n, there are assumptions made about time commitments to large projects, traveling, and time off\u2014these are unfair assumptions.\nMade to pay when taking parenthood leave\nWhen say \u2018no\u2019, looked at negatively. When men say \u2018no\u2019, their reason is accepted. \n\u00a0\n\u00a0\nFrom:\n Fava, Dani \nSent:\n Tuesday, November 15, 2022 10:11 AM\nTo:\n Emani Richmond <e.richmond@lcwmail.com>\nCc:\n Kelly Salek <k.salek@lcwmail.com>\nSubject:\n RE: Final Ageism & Sexism Content (11/17)\n\u00a0\nI\u2019m free at 4:30 ET today\n\u00a0\nFrom:\n Emani Richmond <e.richmond@lcwmail.com> \nSent:\n Tuesday, November 15, 2022 10:04 AM\nTo:\n Fava, Dani <Dani.Fava@envestnet.com>\nCc:\n Kelly Salek <k.salek@lcwmail.com>\nSubject:\n RE: Final Ageism & Sexism Content (11/17)\n\u00a0\nEXTERNAL MAIL: USE CAUTION BEFORE CLICKING LINKS OR OPENING ATTACHMENTS.

I don\u2019t want you to feel overwhelmed about the facilitator content but rather lean into the expertise you bring into this space and that is your lived experiences. \n\u00a0\nLet me know your thoughts. \n\u00a0\nThank you for partnering with us for this project and LCW in general!\n\u00a0\n-\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nEmani Richmond \n(she/her/hers)\nAssociate Consultant, \nLCW\nEmail: e.richmond@lcwmail.com\nPhone: +1.773.888.4979\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\nwww\u00a0|\u00a0Twitter |\u00a0Facebook\u00a0|\u00a0LinkedIn\u00a0 \n\u00a0\nTo inspire kindness, deepen\u00a0understanding, and\nfoster equity in\u00a0the communities\u00a0where people\nlive\u00a0and at the organizations where they\u00a0work.\n\u00a0\nDisclaimer: The information in this email is confidential and may be legally privileged.

In terms of setting a timeline associated with these changes, Carta has purchased this product for February of 2023.

Thanks for your patience as I find time to get back to you on this. \n\u00a0\nSo yes, earlier this year Tamara suggested to me that this session would fit well as a SPOTLIGHT on the Black Experience (since we didn\u2019t have a Spotlight about the Black community). At that time I did review it and had comments/questions that I sent out \u2013 but we were all too busy with other client priorities and it got stuck. It has been sitting in TRAINING\\2-Classroom Programs\\5-MINIWORKSHOPS\\IDENTITY BASED\\SPOTLIGHT on Black Experience_INPROCESS and it is here.\n\u00a0\nFast forward. In speaking with Melissa and Jake last week about the next \u2018bundles\u2019 promotion around Black History Month, I brought this up. They were both quite excited about the prospect of including a Spotlight about the Black Experience. I solicited Jeffrey\u2019s help in \u201cLCW-izing\u201d the session, and getting it ready for full rollout for any client (reason I\u2019m copying him on this message). LCW-izing includes: updating it where necessary (e.g, headlines), deciding if we want to make it U.S. centered like our other Spotlights or not (and if not, we\u2019d need to either rename it or add content from other countries), looking at it from an instructional design POV, making sure it minimizes content overlap with other programs, making sure the notes are thorough/complete, making sure the graphic design is done, etc. etc.\n\u00a0\nA few comments and questions that perhaps can be answered by Emani in a Teams meeting:\nThe Carta session was about the Black Experience in \u2018the Americas\u2019 \u2013 though it focused only on the US, Canada, and Brazil. (The headlines slide contained headlines from the U.S., Canada, one about Brazil, one about the UN, and one about racism by Latinos in the U.S.)\nSome of the slides contained speaker notes and transitions that are not aligned with the slide content\nThe \u201c56 Black Men Project\u201d in the UK in the timeline needs to be replaced (not \u2018the Americas\u2019)\nI had suggested removing the microinequities slides (because they appear in a few of our other programs) and just go with the \u201cHow would you respond\u201d (HWYR) - present the first HWYR question, have them think but then we give them suggested answers (to model), then we elicit answers from them for the other two HWYR scenarios. Or we could add a slide about microaggressions. \nI had a couple of additional questions in the comments. \nI see that the version in the Miniworkshops folder, which is the version I reviewed earlier this year, is a bit different than the one Emani points to below \u2013 for example:\nSlide 9, \u201cThe Impact of Stereotype Threat\u201d with Larry\u2019s photo, is new to me. \nIn the version I looked at earlier this year, there was a slide with a table that listed stereotypes and corresponding Facts & Implications that I don\u2019t see in the version Emani points to below.\nIn the version I looked at earlier this year, there were a couple of slides on microinequities that don\u2019t exist in the version Emani points to below. \nThe \u201chow to be an ally\u201d slide has changed, and the P&H video was not in the version I looked at.\nThe HWYR scenarios do not exist in the version Emani points to below.\n\u00a0\nIn the meantime, Jeffrey and I talked about prioritizing a Spotlight about the Black Experience in the U.S., and then also doing a version about the Black Experience in North America since we have a lot of good Canada content in there too. \n\u00a0\nWelcome your reactions and thoughts!\nRP\n\u00a0\n-\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nRebecca M.

It had been a hard few days. After the original incident I began to wonder if I was right to see it that way. After all, taken on its own, it didn\u2019t look so bad. But those who knew the backstory and the culture reassured me that my initial reaction was right.\nWhat I did not anticipate - how could I have - was that this particular incident would take me back to a time in my childhood where I felt less than safe. \nA time that was turbulent, unsettled. \nA time where we\u2019d left the place I called home and moved to somewhere new where I didn\u2019t feel I fitted in. \nA time when I could not be open about my home life, and where I never knew what chaos would await me. \nThough I shut away many of the feelings related to that, I know now that it was traumatic, and that the incident of racism reawakened some of that trauma.\nIn the moment where I had to confront the person who had harmed me, I didn\u2019t recognise myself. I was perspiring, nauseous and found it hard to speak. I learned later that this was also a trauma response, brought on by the annihilation of the safe space I thought I\u2019d been in.\nIt was a hard thing to realise that one person could shatter that sense of security. But I was grateful for the support of all those who listened, helped me process, suggested coping mechanisms. These things allowed me to rediscover some balance. And although the scab is thin, it is now there. \nAs things have turned out, I won\u2019t have to work with that person again. But it\u2019s reminded me, as if I didn\u2019t know, just how harmful racism can be, and how essential it is to eradicate it. Because it\u2019s not just about what happens in the here and now, it\u2019s about all the layers of trauma during the past decades. \nNobody should have to go through this. No person who faces isms should have to be traumatised. A world where that no longer happens, where everyone belongs and is truly equal, will finally put that behind us. \nBy supporting me, friend, you gave me hope that we can get there. And you also provided the certainty that I would survive that experience no matter how unlikely it seemed in the moment. \nIf you never knew how much I appreciated that and, more importantly, you, I hope you know now.\nHugs,\nSharon\nAs I said, it took a while to be able to publish this. For a long time, the experience was too close and too raw (and that feeling can still sneak up on my sometimes), but that support was - and remains steadfast. \nAllies and advocates, sometimes this is what we need, so think about how you can support those around you who might be having a similar experience. \nLeave a comment\nThanks for reading,\nSharon\nEnjoyed this article?

Being online today also revolves around checking a growing list of social media feeds. Excess time on these platforms has been shown to exacerbate mental health issues and is associated with low self-esteem.\nAnd adults may struggle with low productivity or weakened social ties due to screen time, says Dr. Carl Marci, a psychiatrist at Massachusetts General Hospital and author of \nRewired: Protecting Your Brain in the Digital Age. \nIt\u2019s not too late to reassess your screen time and create \u201ctech-life balance,\u201d Marci says.

Prioritize your connections \n\u201cWe\u2019ve lost the art of interpersonal communication,\u201d Jennifer Kelman, a licensed social worker and mental health expert with JustAnswer, tells Fortune. We can get it back by making plans with friends and family who energize us. Make eye contact. Keep your phone in your pocket. Listen. Even small activities that can \ninstill joy\n can help replace the satisfaction of the screen.\u00a0 \n2. Take stock of your social media use\u00a0 \nAssess how you feel when scrolling through other people\u2019s lives on \nsocial media\n. Are there platforms that give you energy and leave you feeling downright bad after you engage? The latter may signal that certain content does not serve you. \nTo combat this, consider limiting time spent on social apps to a particular time of day. For example, avoid looking at a certain platform after 7 p.m. Make flexible rules. Don\u2019t berate yourself if you break them. Remind yourself that \nhabits are hard to break\n, but you would rather be uplifted than depleted. \n3. Don\u2019t respond right away\nWhen seeing a text pop up during work, it can be tempting to reply right away. Yes, there are times when matters are urgent, but often, waiting until we have a moment to breathe and be more attentive to these messages can help improve our relationship with our phones. Besides, \nmultitasking\n hampers productivity, and screen time is often the culprit.\u00a0\n \nRead Alexa Mikhail\u2019s full article \nhere\n.\n\u200a\n\u200a\n \n \n \n \n\u200a\n\u00a0CONTENT FROM CVS HEALTH\u00a0\n\u00a0\nSuicide Prevention and Awareness\n\u00a0\n90 percent of people who die by suicide have a potentially treatable mental health condition.

I\u00b4ll try to resume:\nAs I had told you before, Dropbox doesn\u00b4t allow me to download to work at my computer to reload later. \nI have to work there with very limited resources. I can\u00b4t insert pictures or slides. \nWhen you send a file for edition, the person can\u00b4t download the file, just edit. You probably haven\u00b4t seen the version it shows for people with whom you share your file for edition.\nIt only allows me to RENAME, not to save to my computer. I renamed to version 5 and saved there (the only possible option).\nSo, I don\u00b4t have the version5 at my computer. \nPlease send me this version 5 to save to my computer, like you did with the first file. \nI cleared out the text from the slides the most I could.\nI\u00b4m sending you some pictures in a different email.\n\u00a0\nEvery time the material comes and goes, the colors change. Some slides are in dark blue, other in a horrible turquoise color. I had changed it in my previous editions, but it came back.\n\u00a0\nAt what time you would like to talk tomorrow? If possible, I would prefer at any time in the afternoon.

How can organizations do more than just \u201ckeep up\u201d? What strategies, structures, and talent management approaches will business leaders need to adopt to prepare their organizations for a gen-AI-driven future? In this month\u2019s first featured story, McKinsey\u2019s Sandra Durth, \nBryan Hancock\n, \nDana Maor\n, and \nAlex Sukharevsky\n explain that gen AI can be a powerful tool for employee empowerment if business leaders think broadly about how gen AI could affect their organizations\u2014and people\u2014day to day.

In fact, the expectation is to produce a little bit more each and every single day. Forever. Until the day we die. When it\u2019s laid out like that, it\u2019s so much easier to see the ridiculousness of that sentiment. Instead of being a machine that always feels the same and continues to produce more each day, we are human\u2019s being. \nWe are of nature\n, which means we live cyclically, just like Mother Nature does. Here\u2019s how you can tune into cyclical living:\nTurn to nature:\n When we forget we\u2019re nature and not a machine, there\u2019s a simple solution. And it\u2019s right outside your window. Tune into nature. My favorite ritual is to regularly visit my favorite tree. I watch how the tree changes and grows over the seasons. In winter, it\u2019s bare, but during the early summer it flourishes.\nAccept that we are cyclical:\n During the winter, the soil rests and replenishes. If it didn\u2019t, it wouldn\u2019t be able to grow a crop the next spring. Just as the earth rests, so must we. Our rest is equally important as our production.\nDo something kind, gentle, and cozy for yourself:\n One of my favorite ways to support myself is to ask this question: how can I make this 10% easier? When we need rest, but can\u2019t necessarily take the day off, we can support ourselves by finding ways to make the task easier, gentler, or more cozy.\nIs it a microwave or stovetop kind of day:\n My favorite snack is popcorn. The best popcorn is made on the stovetop. But sometimes, you need a snack and don\u2019t have the time to pop it on the stove, melt the butter, and do the dishes. Those days are microwave popcorn days. Both end in popcorn. How we get there isn\u2019t always as important as the end result.\nTalk to yourself like you would your pet:\n We celebrate our pets for everything. Being cute, rolling over, sleeping in the middle of the day, finishing their food, having a round, adorable belly. Why can\u2019t we also talk to ourselves that way? We can.\nTOGETHER WITH MIRO\nHow well do you know your team?\n\u00a0 \n\u00a0\n1 truth 2 lies\n is a simple icebreaker to do and creates healthy banter.\nHere's how to play: \nTeam members populate a total of three sticky notes with 2 lies and 1 truth.\nOnce completed, everyone uses dots to vote for the one they think is the truth.\nDo a round-robin where each person gets to share verbally what the correct \"truth\" sticky was.\nThis icebreaker\n is really easy, quick and fun, and is a great way to energize your team before starting a meeting.\n\u00a0 \nSwipe the template and play with your team\nA QUOTE\u00a0TO LIVE BY\nFrom Ralph Waldo Emerson\n\"Do not go where the path may lead, go instead where there is no path and leave a trail.\"\nJUST FOR FUN\nJoanna's Recs\nShow to binge \ud83d\udcfa :\u00a0\nBob's Burgers (S14 just started!)\nSong to bump \ud83c\udfb5:\nBody by Loud Luxury feat.

Could you find the text with the spelling errors and make the connections on your end? \n\u00a0\nAlso, given that my client is in the tech space they mainly have people in younger generations there is WAY too much text on the slides. Please move any text that is not necessary for the reader to see into the speaker notes so it will be sure to be covered there. I began to try and shorten and simplify the text on the slides but without fully understanding the major talking points you want to bring up I didn\u2019t want to remove text that was essential for the slide. \n\u00a0\nI will be working on Monday so we will have one final day to wrap up edits and speaking assignments before we chat. I assume any slides you create you will deliver, and the LCW slides that remain in the presentation I will deliver those. Feel free to send me a voice note on WhatsApp tomorrow if further clarification is needed. \n\u00a0\nEssentially:\nPlease make the information on slides shorter bullet points\nAlso are there any relevant images of Brazil that we can include in the presentation?\nIf you send me images I can put them in the presentation\nWe can connect again on Monday to wrap up final notes before we deliver the training\n\u00a0\nThank you for your expertise on this content, I\u2019m excited to see the final product. \n\u00a0\nEmani Richmond\n(she/her/hers)\nConsultant\nLCW\nWebsite\n\u00a0\n|\n\u00a0\nTwitter\n \n|\n\u00a0\nFacebook\n\u00a0\n|\n\u00a0\nLinkedIn\nView our upcoming events\n | \nSign-up for our newsletter\n\u00a0\nFrom:\n \nica@infolink.com.br\n <\nica@infolink.com.br\n> \nSent:\n Wednesday, October 4, 2023 2:54 PM\nTo:\n Emani Richmond <\ne.richmond@lcwmail.com\n>\nSubject:\n RE: Lucy sent you Carta_Understanding_Brazilian_Work_Culture-2023 (3).pptx via WeTransfer\n\u00a0\nHi Emani\n\u00a0\nI\u00b4ve sent you a final file, where I corrected small mistakes and formatted the slide about Reasoning to the same patterns used at the others.\n\u00a0\nI hope this doesn\u00b4t cause any troubles for you.\n\u00a0\nHugs& kisses\nLucy\n\u00a0\nFrom:\n Emani Richmond <\ne.richmond@lcwmail.com\n> \nSent:\n Tuesday, October 3, 2023 5:03 PM\nTo:\n \nica@infolink.com.br\nSubject:\n Re: Lucy sent you Carta_Understanding_Brazilian_Work_Culture-2023 (3).pptx via WeTransfer\n\u00a0\nThank you Lucy, I have been able to recieve and access this presentation.

Please move any text that is not necessary for the reader to see into the speaker notes so it will be sure to be covered there. I began to try and shorten and simplify the text on the slides but without fully understanding the major talking points you want to bring up I didn\u2019t want to remove text that was essential for the slide. \n\u00a0\nI will be working on Monday so we will have one final day to wrap up edits and speaking assignments before we chat. I assume any slides you create you will deliver, and the LCW slides that remain in the presentation I will deliver those. Feel free to send me a voice note on WhatsApp tomorrow if further clarification is needed. \n\u00a0\nEssentially:\nPlease make the information on slides shorter bullet points\nAlso are there any relevant images of Brazil that we can include in the presentation?\nIf you send me images I can put them in the presentation\nWe can connect again on Monday to wrap up final notes before we deliver the training\n\u00a0\nThank you for your expertise on this content, I\u2019m excited to see the final product. \n\u00a0\nEmani Richmond\n(she/her/hers)\nConsultant\nLCW\nWebsite\n\u00a0\n|\n\u00a0\nTwitter\n \n|\n\u00a0\nFacebook\n\u00a0\n|\n\u00a0\nLinkedIn\nView our upcoming events\n | \nSign-up for our newsletter\n\u00a0\nFrom:\n \nica@infolink.com.br\n <\nica@infolink.com.br\n> \nSent:\n Wednesday, October 4, 2023 2:54 PM\nTo:\n Emani Richmond <\ne.richmond@lcwmail.com\n>\nSubject:\n RE: Lucy sent you Carta_Understanding_Brazilian_Work_Culture-2023 (3).pptx via WeTransfer\n\u00a0\nHi Emani\n\u00a0\nI\u00b4ve sent you a final file, where I corrected small mistakes and formatted the slide about Reasoning to the same patterns used at the others.\n\u00a0\nI hope this doesn\u00b4t cause any troubles for you.\n\u00a0\nHugs& kisses\nLucy\n\u00a0\nFrom:\n Emani Richmond <\ne.richmond@lcwmail.com\n> \nSent:\n Tuesday, October 3, 2023 5:03 PM\nTo:\n \nica@infolink.com.br\nSubject:\n Re: Lucy sent you Carta_Understanding_Brazilian_Work_Culture-2023 (3).pptx via WeTransfer\n\u00a0\nThank you Lucy, I have been able to recieve and access this presentation.

As the Chief of Staff for the \nGeorgia Youth Justice Coalition\n, a HEAL Together partner, she\u2019s helped implement significant initiatives to give students access to everything from mental health resources to recreational partnerships.\u00a0\nUsing HEAL Together tools and support, Myla and her peers are fighting for public schools that will provide all young people with the resources they need to thrive. And \nthey\u2019re winning\n - restoring millions of dollars in public education funding, securing representative maps, protecting LGBTQ+ youth, and so much more.\nYour support is needed and important to help Myla and so many other HEAL Together partners like her.\n It is going to take all of us, together, to protect the most vulnerable among us and build a future where young people can access the promise of an equitable, quality public education for all.\nJoin us\n in making this vision a reality. \nEn solidaridad,\nMarina Mu\u00f1oz de Mart\u00ednez\nDirector of Development & Partnerships\nP.S.

Help ensure your Latinx colleagues aren\u2019t asked to do all the stretching. \n\u00a0Continue to educate yourself actively on the experiences of the Latinx community.\n\u00a0\nWe will need to work in slide 12 (of the images of the famous leaders from the community) into the post session handout and will need 1-2 business days to make that addition. \n\u00a0\nWe have released the November dates for the BCI, and will await final word from you folks about dates to hold for December.\n\u00a0\nBest,\n\u00a0\nEmani Richmond\n(she/her/hers)\nConsultant\nLCW\nWebsite\n\u00a0\n|\n\u00a0\nTwitter\n \n|\n\u00a0\nFacebook\n\u00a0\n|\n\u00a0\nLinkedIn\nView our upcoming events\n | \nSign-up for our newsletter\n\u00a0\nCAUTION:\n This email originated from outside of our organization.

I assume any slides you create you will deliver, and the LCW slides that remain in the presentation I will deliver those. Feel free to send me a voice note on WhatsApp tomorrow if further clarification is needed. \n\u00a0\nEssentially:\nPlease make the information on slides shorter bullet points\nAlso are there any relevant images of Brazil that we can include in the presentation?\nIf you send me images I can put them in the presentation\nWe can connect again on Monday to wrap up final notes before we deliver the training\n\u00a0\nThank you for your expertise on this content, I\u2019m excited to see the final product. \n\u00a0\nEmani Richmond\n(she/her/hers)\nConsultant\nLCW\nWebsite\n\u00a0\n|\n\u00a0\nTwitter\n \n|\n\u00a0\nFacebook\n\u00a0\n|\n\u00a0\nLinkedIn\nView our upcoming events\n | \nSign-up for our newsletter\n\u00a0\nFrom:\n ica@infolink.com.br <ica@infolink.com.br> \nSent:\n Wednesday, October 4, 2023 2:54 PM\nTo:\n Emani Richmond <e.richmond@lcwmail.com>\nSubject:\n RE: Lucy sent you Carta_Understanding_Brazilian_Work_Culture-2023 (3).pptx via WeTransfer\n\u00a0\nHi Emani\n\u00a0\nI\u00b4ve sent you a final file, where I corrected small mistakes and formatted the slide about Reasoning to the same patterns used at the others.\n\u00a0\nI hope this doesn\u00b4t cause any troubles for you.\n\u00a0\nHugs& kisses\nLucy\n\u00a0\nFrom:\n Emani Richmond <\ne.richmond@lcwmail.com\n> \nSent:\n Tuesday, October 3, 2023 5:03 PM\nTo:\n \nica@infolink.com.br\nSubject:\n Re: Lucy sent you Carta_Understanding_Brazilian_Work_Culture-2023 (3).pptx via WeTransfer\n\u00a0\nThank you Lucy, I have been able to recieve and access this presentation.

The \u201csober October\u201d movement has joined \u201cdry January\u201d as a time to be mindful about alcohol consumption and focus on better health.\nStudies show that people who participate in these month-long sobriety challenges frequently experience lasting benefits. Often, they drink less in the long run and make other sustained changes to their drinking habits that lead to striking improvements in their health and well-being.\nWhy does it work?\nA month of sobriety, while it can sound daunting, is not so long that it seems impossible.\nA month is long enough that it provides opportunities to form new habits \u2014 such as turning down alcohol in social settings, which in the long term can be empowering.\nTaking a break from alcohol can trigger immediate health benefits such as weight loss, better sleep and a boost to your mood and energy levels, which can reinforce the new habit.\nIf you\u2019re embarking on a sober October, we\u2019ve got tips for living alcohol-free.

    "body": "Five workday snacks to try.\nView this email in your browser.\n\u00a0\nPresented by CVS Health\n5 snacks that boost energy and focus during your workday\nOctober 5, 2023\n\u200a\nAmericans are snacking more than ever: On average U.S. adults eat between one and three snacks a day, and they account for nearly a quarter of their daily calories.\u00a0\n\u00a0\nNutritionists say you should snack wisely, as certain choices may either boost energy and productivity or bring on the \nmidday slump\n.\u00a0\n\u00a0\nCarbohydrates alone, for example, are digested quickly and may provide short-lived bursts of energy, says Angela Blackstone, a registered dietitian at the Ohio State University Wexner Medical Center. For more sustained energy, she recommends pairing carbohydrates with foods rich in fiber and protein and avoiding \nultra-processed\n, sugary, pro-\ninflammatory foods that contribute to sugar crashes, and raise your risk for chronic diseases.\u00a0\n \n\u00a0\nHere are five workday snacks to try:\n\u00a0\n1. Plain Greek yogurt\u00a0\n\u00a0\nA cup of greek yogurt is high in protein and low in sugar, packed with calcium, probiotics, and stress-fighting B12. It may also help improve bone health.\u00a0\n\u00a0\n2. Mixed nuts\u00a0\n\u00a0\nNuts are an easy-to-pack snack that are rich in protein and \u201cheart-healthy fats,\u201d according to Dr. Linda Anegawa, an internal and obesity medicine physician and medical director at PlushCare, which offers primary care and mental health services.\n\u00a0\n3. Hard-boiled eggs\n\u00a0\nHard-boiled eggs are packed with protein and antioxidants. \u201cAdd a cheese stick in for extra satisfaction,\u201d Anegawa says. \u201cIf saturated fat is something you are aiming to reduce, go for a part-skim version.\u201d\u00a0\n\u00a0\n4. Raw vegetables and hummus\u00a0\n\u00a0\nRaw vegetables have fiber and antioxidants like vitamins A, K, and folate, which can help you feel full and maintain energy. Consider a serving of hummus with one cup of carrots, cucumbers, and bell peppers, Blackstone says.\n\u00a0\n5. Chickpeas\u00a0\n\u00a0\nChickpeas are another easy-access snack that contain high levels of fiber and protein. Consider roasting them with spices to add flavor. \nRead Alexa Mikhail\u2019s full article \nhere\n.\n\u200a\n5 things you can do to reduce the risk of dementia\nDementia impacts 55 million people globally.

The concept of Hispanic Heritage Month was originally a weeklong celebration that was expanded to a month-long recognition in 1988. The month-long celebration coincides with the Independence Day celebrations of Costa Rica, Guatemala, Honduras, El Salvador, and Nicaragu\na.\n \nHere's What's New!\nHispanic Heritage Month x International Podcast Day\nPodcasters of Color are set to be the global majority in the future. \nIn our latest episode of Momentum: A Race Forward Podcast, \nHendel Leiva, Manager of Podcasts and Audio Initiatives interviews the co-founders of BIPOC Podcast Creators Tangia Al-awaji Estrada and Maribel Quezada-Smith. Tangia and Maribel share their stories of how they became podcasters, the challenges they experienced as women of color in podcasting, and how a Facebook group was the catalyst for founding and launching the BIPOC Podcast Creators in 2021. They also talk about the exponential growth of the BIPOC Podcast Creators community, and the wins in representation, access, and partnerships generated across the industry for its members.\nListen on Apple\nListen on Spotify\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n \n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\nWatch it Here\nIn the new video from Colorlines, \u201cCourage Is Contagious\u201d \nAlejandra Gomez, Executive Director of Living United for Change in Arizona (LUCHA), speaks about how the courage to exercise one\u2019s voice against injustice can encourage others to enact theirs around a shared purpose, which over time can catalyze movement-building momentum that sustains for the long run. Reflecting on the ten years of organizing against deportations and laws such as the infamous SB1070 law in Arizona, she talks about the resilience to continue fighting for human dignity and \u201cvoicing our vote at the ballot box.\"\nRevisiting Reflections\nThe \ncurrent iteration of the immigration crisis\n has renewed calls for comprehensive reform.

(choose one answer per question) \n(multi-question poll, single answer)\n\u00a0\nPeople whose cultural background or heritage is Latin American prefer to identify as: Latino/a\u00a0 / (b) Hispanic / (c) Latinx / (d) Chicano / (e ) Their country of origin (e.g., Dominican-American or Guatemalan) / \n(f) Any of the above\n\u00a0\nHispanics are projected to account for x% of net new workers between 2020 and 2030. \n10%\n55%\n78%\n100%\n\u00a0\nTrue\n/False 80% of new U.S. businesses over the last decade were created by Hispanics.\n\u00a0\nWhat percent of the U.S. population identifies as Latino/Hispanic?\n1.1% \n6.0% \n10.2% \n12.4% \n18.7% \n\u00a0\nTrue/\nFalse\n: In the past ten years, the state with the fastest growth rate of Latino residents was California.\n\u00a0\nPoll 2: \nPrioritizing Latinx Challenges (single answer)\nWhat do you see or experience most frequently within your team or organization? (choose one)\nPerceived as underperforming.\nJudged more rigorously than their white peers.\nPerceived as lacking confidence, competence, or presence due to lack of \u201cassertiveness.\u201d\nPerceived as lacking initiative or ambition.\nPerceived as having lower communication skills.\nSee few Latinx represented in leadership.\nPoll 3\n: Call to Action (multiple answer)\nIn this poll, choose ALL the actions you can take to be an even more inclusive leader or colleague in teams that include Hispanic/Latin colleagues:\nAppreciate the diversity within the community. Remember that Latinx colleagues have different national, linguistic, and cultural backgrounds. \nResist immediately under-evaluating your Latinx team members when they exhibit a work or communication approach that you're not used to.\nExplicitly and regularly discuss the \u201cunwritten rules\u201d of success at your organization with everyone. Don't assume people know or \"should know.\" \n\u00a0Advocate for cultural diversity with regard to voices, skills, and approaches.

    "body": "Inside the business world's diversity dissonance and the potential consequence.\nView this email in your browser.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\nInside corporate America\u2019s diversity dissonance\u2014and the resulting consequence\nOctober 4, 2023\n\u200a\nGood afternoon.\nCorporate America\u2019s 2020 rallying cries for racial equity and social justice have since turned into a bleating whimper. Netflix, Disney, and Warner Bros. Discovery are among the spate of companies that \nhave parted ways with\n high-level diversity, equity, and inclusion executives. And as \nBloomberg \nnoted\n last month, talk of DEI has fallen precipitously in the wake of the Supreme Court\u2019s reversal of affirmative action, in what some fear might be the coup de grace to what was once a zealous championing of corporate diversity efforts.\nAlas, it begs the question: Did corporate America have courage in its socially conscious convictions in the first place?\nIt\u2019s a perceptive query my colleague Maria Aspan poses in an enthralling and \nthought-provoking piece\n published this week, exploring the business world\u2019s volant retreat from ESG-related matters.\n\u201cCompanies find themselves stumbling down a rapidly narrowing path between the razor-wire fences of heightened consumer expectations and well-organized political trolling,\u201d she writes, pointing to recent implosions of socially conscious branding, corporate skirmishes with lawmakers over \u201cwoke\u201d ideology, and an ever-expanding wave of \nlegal challenges\n to companies and investors over their diversity, equity, and inclusion policies.\nBut wait. There\u2019s more. The 2024 election cycle is fast approaching, and if it\u2019s anything like its predecessor, it will be a grueling fight that turns seemingly innocuous efforts to ameliorate historical wrongs into a hyper-partisan ploy for votes. Corporations will almost certainly be caught in the crosshairs.\nAdmittedly\u2014cue the world\u2019s tiniest violin\u2014this isn\u2019t easy terrain for leaders, whether CEOs or chief diversity heads, to traverse. But companies that offer shallow, disingenuous commitments to societal betterment can expect to be pilloried by both the right and the left\u2014along with their consumers, employees, and the public at large.\nActing with conviction will become all the more crucial, requiring that leaders prepare for how to respond to pushback, lest they be lambasted as weak-spined and underhanded. That has already come to fruition, Aspan notes, and it\u2019s no surprise that terms like \u201c\u2018pinkwashing,\u2019 \u2018rainbow washing,\u2019 and \u2018performative allyship\u2019 have entered the corporate lexicon.\nSo where does that leave companies? Well, they must first reckon upfront with the financial costs of executing their big stakeholder capitalist ideas, Paul Washington, head of the ESG Center for the Conference Board, tells Aspan. \nWhile few for-profit firms will follow the lead of a Patagonia or a Ben & Jerry\u2019s\u2014or on the other side of the bipartisan coin, an X, formerly known as Twitter\u2014they can create stronger, more coherent guidelines on when and how to engage in vocal corporate activism. Or, as Aspan writes, \u201cshut up about their so-called values.\u201d\nCheck out her compulsory reading on the \ntrolling of corporate America here\n.\nRuth Umoh\n@ruthumohnews\nruth.umoh@fortune.com\nWhat\u2019s Trending\n\u200a\nSee something, say something. \nCEOs don\u2019t want to enter the political fray, ex-Merck CEO Ken Frazier, one of the few Black Fortune 500 chief executives, told attendees at \nFortune\n\u2019s CEO Initiative on Tuesday. But they have a responsibility as the \u201cmost influential citizens\u201d to speak up when elected politicians aren\u2019t upholding the country\u2019s democratic ideals and principles. \nFortune\nMixed bag. \nGood news: Boards are turning less to CEOs for director seats, a practice that has excluded women and those from underrepresented groups. The bad: They\u2019ve withdrawn from a previous increase in appointing women and racial minorities to openings. \nWSJ\nUnauthorized immigration\n. U.S. employers benefit from a broken migration system. Migrants today are employed in nearly every blue-collar industry, performing jobs like packing Cheerios, washing hotel sheets, and sanitizing chicken-processing plants. \nNYT\n\u00a0\nThe Emerging CFO: Future Finance Leaders\n\u200a\nFinance and IT as co-innovation partners\nJoin Fortune and Workday on Wednesday, Oct. 25, at 11 a.m. ET.

It\u2019s both a challenging and awkward question to answer, says \nFortune\n senior writer Lila MacLellan. There\u2019s the famed activist investor Carl Icahn, who, at age 87, still runs his Icahn Enterprises. Michael Bloomberg, the 81-year-old founder of his namesake financial information and media giant. And Blackstone CEO and cofounder Stephen Schwarzman, 76. While some aging leaders have named successors, many have been accused of \u201cbeing unable or unwilling to make space for a new, more diverse generation of leaders.\u201d \n \n\u200a\nThanks for reading.\n\u00a0\nIf you liked \nthis email\n, pay it forward.

(choose one answer per question) \n(multi-question poll, single answer)\n\u00a0\nPeople whose cultural background or heritage is Latin American prefer to identify as: Latino/a\u00a0 / (b) Hispanic / (c) Latinx / (d) Chicano / (e ) Their country of origin (e.g., Dominican-American or Guatemalan) / \n(f) Any of the above\n\u00a0\nHispanics are projected to account for x% of net new workers between 2020 and 2030. \n10%\n55%\n78%\n100%\n\u00a0\nTrue\n/False 80% of new U.S. businesses over the last decade were created by Hispanics.\n\u00a0\nWhat percent of the U.S. population identifies as Latino/Hispanic?\n1.1% \n6.0% \n10.2% \n12.4% \n18.7% \n\u00a0\nTrue/\nFalse\n: In the past ten years, the state with the fastest growth rate of Latino residents was California.\n\u00a0\nPoll 2: \nPrioritizing Latinx Challenges (single answer)\nWhat do you see or experience most frequently within your team or organization? (choose one)\nPerceived as underperforming.\nJudged more rigorously than their white peers.\nPerceived as lacking confidence, competence, or presence due to lack of \u201cassertiveness.\u201d\nPerceived as lacking initiative or ambition.\nPerceived as having lower communication skills.\nSee few Latinx represented in leadership.\nPoll 3\n: Call to Action (multiple answer)\nIn this poll, choose ALL the actions you can take to be an even more inclusive leader or colleague in teams that include Hispanic/Latin colleagues:\nAppreciate the diversity within the community. Remember that Latinx colleagues have different national, linguistic, and cultural backgrounds. \nResist immediately under-evaluating your Latinx team members when they exhibit a work or communication approach that you're not used to.\nExplicitly and regularly discuss the \u201cunwritten rules\u201d of success at your organization with everyone. Don't assume people know or \"should know.\" \n\u00a0Advocate for cultural diversity with regard to voices, skills, and approaches. Help ensure your Latinx colleagues aren\u2019t asked to do all the stretching. \n\u00a0Continue to educate yourself actively on the experiences of the Latinx community.\n\u00a0\nWe will need to work in slide 12 (of the images of the famous leaders from the community) into the post session handout and will need 1-2 business days to make that addition. \n\u00a0\nWe have released the November dates for the BCI, and will await final word from you folks about dates to hold for December.\n\u00a0\nBest,\n\u00a0\nEmani Richmond\n(she/her/hers)\nConsultant\nLCW\nWebsite\n\u00a0\n|\n\u00a0\nTwitter\n \n|\n\u00a0\nFacebook\n\u00a0\n|\n\u00a0\nLinkedIn\nView our upcoming events\n | \nSign-up for our newsletter\n\u00a0\nCAUTION:\n This email originated from outside of our organization.

Bigotry is not ok. \nAs I posted on LinkedIn some time back:\nI am for equality and against bigotry. That means I am against: \nracism \nanti-Blackness \nanti-LGBTQIA2S+ sentiments \nantisemitism \nableism \nxenophobia \nand other types of bigotry \nSo, why am I bringing this up now? Because I recently came across a Black man (who had been introduced to me as a key supporter of an important anti-racism mission) implying that there was something wrong with being gay. That\u2019s homophobia, and I know it caused harm to some people in the room, even if they had not revealed they were gay. That was not ok.\nI raised it with the person who made the introduction, and I plan to have a more detailed conversation with them soon. It is not ok to let it slide.\nShare\nThat leads me to another point. As my grandparents used to say, two wrongs don\u2019t make a right. \nJust because we have been discriminated against, it doesn\u2019t mean we should discriminate against others in turn. \nI decided a long time ago that I did not want to make anyone feel the way the racists made me feel when I lived in France. For me that means, being against all those types of bigotry I listed at the start. \nAnd it means that even if there is anti-Blackness in other communities - and we know there is - that doesn\u2019t make it right for me, as a Black woman, to be bigoted against those communities.\nI\u2019m not saying I always get it right. I mess up. In fact, that LinkedIn post was made after I inadvertently liked a post with sentiments that didn\u2019t match my values and was called in for it. \nWhen I mess up\n, I follow the advice I give you: I accept responsibility, apologise, do what I can to repair any harm, and avoid making the same mistake again. I don\u2019t look for cookies either. \nThat\u2019s what I did then, and that\u2019s what I\u2019ll continue to do. \nBut the important thing here is that I actively set out to avoid discriminating against others - as an anti-racist, how can I do any less?\nWhat do you think?\nLeave a comment\nThanks for reading,\nSharon\nEnjoyed this article?

As a child, your needs were consistently met with love.\nAvoidant:\n You avoid intimacy and are very independent. You distrust others and don\u2019t like feeling close. Your childhood caregivers may have been distant or punishing when you expressed needs.\nAnxious:\n You desperately seek intimacy but constantly fear rejection. You need a lot of reassurance from your partner because your childhood bond was inconsistent.\nDisorganized:\n You have extreme difficulty trusting others and behave unpredictably in relationships.

    "subject": "Are you getting enough protein?",
    "body": "Protein is the only way to get the nine essential amino acids your body needs.\nView this email in your browser.\n\u00a0\nPresented by CVS Health\nAre you getting enough protein? How to figure out the right amount for you\nOctober 3, 2023\n\u200a\nProtein, one of three types of macronutrients, helps our bodies repair the muscles, bones, and cells vital to keeping our bodies structurally intact. Protein is made up of chains of amino acids, and because the nine essential amino acids are not made by the body, we must get protein from food.\u00a0\n\u00a0\nBut how much protein do you \nactually\n need every day?\u00a0\n\u00a0\nThe general recommendation is that most healthy adults need about 0.8 grams of protein per kilogram of body weight. You can also multiply your weight in pounds by 0.36 to calculate the rounded ideal number of grams. For example, a person who weighs 170 pounds would need around 62 grams of protein per day.\n\u00a0\nRather than getting caught up in complicated calculations, some experts say to just focus on eating protein-rich foods throughout the day, along with a balance of fruits, vegetables, grains, and dairy.\u00a0\n\u00a0\nDo you need more protein as you age?\n\u00a0\nStudies have shown a correlation between increased protein intake for older adults and improved cognitive function and physical health. Since muscle mass begins to shrink starting in your thirties, some experts recommend increasing protein intake to 1\u20131.2 grams of protein per kilogram of body weight beginning at age 40.\u00a0\n\u00a0\nHow much protein do you need if you exercise regularly?\u00a0\n\u00a0\nFor those regularly active, consider upping protein intake to 1.2 to 2 grams per kilogram of body weight. This protein should be spaced out during the day.\u00a0\n\u00a0\nWhat\u2019s the best type of protein?\u00a0\n\u00a0\nDon\u2019t just think about eating more meat. Consider proteins that are not high in saturated fats and not highly processed.\n\u00a0\nProtein-rich foods:\nSalmon: 27 grams of protein for a 5-oz. salmon\nLean chicken breast: 54 grams of protein for a 6-oz. lean chicken breast\u00a0\nWhitefish: 38 grams of protein for one filet of whitefish\nTurkey breast: 29 grams of protein for 3\u00bd oz. of turkey breast\u00a0\n\u00a0\nVegetarian protein-rich foods:\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\nLentils: 12 grams of protein for \u00bd cup of lentils\u00a0\nGreek yogurt: 15\u201320 grams of protein for a 6-oz. cup of yogurt\nEggs: 6\u20138 grams of protein in one egg\u00a0\nChickpeas (garbanzo beans): 14.5 grams of protein for one cup of chickpeas\u00a0\n\u00a0\nRead Alexa Mikhail\u2019s full article \nhere\n.\n\u200a\n\u200a\n \n \n \n \n\u200a\n\u00a0CONTENT FROM CVS HEALTH\u00a0\n\u00a0\nA Reboot for Preventive Care\n\u00a0\nLearn more about the historical context and current shortfalls in preventive care and take a deep dive into two promising solutions: Retail health care as an enabler of primary care services and a widening scope for pharmacists as access points for testing, vaccines and even treatment.\n\u00a0\nRead the report\n\u200a\n\u200a\nMore from Fortune Well:\nA nutrient found in energy drinks can slow aging in animals\nWhat it means for people.\nWomen drop $15 billion more annually on medical expenses than men\nHow employers can fix the covert health insurance \u201cpink tax.\u201d\n\u200a\nRead more at Fortune Well\n \n \n \n \n \n\u00a0\nThe next wave of care\n\u200a\nCheck out Fortune's Innovators Shaping the Future of Health\n\u00a0\nThis year's winners offer creative solutions to systemic health care problems.\n\u00a0\nExplore the list\n\u200a\n \n\u200a\nThis email was sent to e.richmond@lcwmail.com\u00a0\n\u00a0\nManage subscriptions or \nunsubscribe here\n\u00a0\nFortune Media (USA) Corporation\n40 Fulton Street\u00a0New York, NY. 10038",

We try to have images on screen be easier for participants to read and digest, so I would encourage you to limit the text on screen only to what is most helpful for people to read during the session, and then have the rest of the text go into the speaker notes that you will read\u00a0during the session.\n\u00a0\nHere is a link to the version of the Cultural program we put together for the client last year. Within these slides you will find the LCW definition of Culture, also key slides we share for steps people can take to become an ally to our focus group which are Brazilian colleagues at this time.\n\u00a0\nhttps://www.dropbox.com/scl/fi/flelphitqougu4vthnfw3/Carta_Understanding_Brazilian_Work_Culture-2023.pptx?rlkey=03fioaykxsp8h0verq2lxsiyn&dl=0\nCarta_Understanding_Brazilian_Work_Culture-2023.pptx\nShared with Dropbox\nwww.dropbox.com\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\nPlease let\u00a0me\u00a0know if you have any trouble accessing the link above.

I appreciate the opportunities I have been presented due to the consistent light and excellence I have brought into the organization. I deeply value the professional relationships I've been able to develop here and the ability to present my skills on multiple platforms. However, due to the severe emotional distress I have undergone through uncertainty with the 20% pay reduction, unclear guidance from leadership about the specifics around how the company will rebound from the economic uncertainty, and growing job dissatisfaction I needed to make the best choice for my health and well-being. I remain committed to the health and wellness of my past, and current LCW colleagues and if the opportunity arises for me to partner with LCW in the future I hope you all would not hesitate to reach out. \n\u00a0\nPlease let me know if there is any way I can assist with the transition as I have ongoing client work that is in various stages of delivery.

But sometimes, the relationship between you and your plan can become a little warped.\u00a0\nLet\u2019s say your plan is perfect, but too complex. You don\u2019t actually have time to do everything you planned to do. Or maybe your plan is too perfect. You start on the deliverables only to realize the reality will never live up to your perfect plan. Or maybe just making the plan is enough to kick off your procrastination reflex. You know exactly what you planned to do but you really don\u2019t want to do it.\u00a0\nA \npossible solution\n: Spend only 10% of your time planning and 90% of your time doing the work.\u00a0\nWhy?\n\u00a0\nTo avoid the productive procrastination trap known as overplanning. The rule also ensures you start executing a plan before you\u2019ve spent too long on it. You\u2019ll know sooner rather than later if your perfect plan is unrealistic, you know, before you get too attached to it.\nTOGETHER WITH BONUSLY\nSwipe This Stay Interview Template\n\u00a0 \n\u00a0\nIt\u2019s rare that you can change someone\u2019s mind in an exit interview. \nA stay interview gives your employees a safe space to share how you can better support and develop them for the long haul\n.\nWhen you proactively identify strengths and weaknesses in your retention efforts and company culture, you can make improvements \nbefore\n employees leave.\nThe free\u00a0\nStay Interview Template\n includes:\n \n\ud83d\udc49 Directions for how to use the template.\n\u2705 Guided questions around manager feedback, company feedback, and building connections.\n\ud83d\udca1 Tips on how to make the most of your stay interviews.\n\u2699\ufe0f Additional tools and resources to build resilient teams.\n\ud83d\udc49\u00a0\nGet your free stay interview template\nLEVEL UP\nThe memory game: dance edition\nAgain and again, \nresearch suggests\n the best way to exercise your memory is through general physical exercise.

I appreciate the opportunities I have been presented due to the consistent light and excellence I have brought into the organization. I deeply value the professional relationships I've been able to develop here and the ability to present my skills on multiple platforms. However, due to the severe emotional distress I have undergone through uncertainty with the 20% pay reduction, unclear guidance from leadership about the specifics around how the company will rebound from the economic uncertainty, and growing job dissatisfaction I needed to make the best choice for my health and well-being. I remain committed to the health and wellness of my past, and current LCW colleagues and if the opportunity arises for me to partner with LCW in the future I hope you all would not hesitate to reach out. \n\u00a0\nPlease let me know if there is any way I can assist with the transition as I have ongoing client work that is in various stages of delivery.

    "body": "Hello Lucy,\nThank you for sending these slides over. We try to have images on screen be easier for participants to read and digest, so I would encourage you to limit the text on screen only to what is most helpful for people to read during the session, and then have the rest of the text go into the speaker notes that you will read\u00a0during the session.\nHere is a link to the version of the Cultural program we put together for the client last year. Within these slides you will find the LCW definition of Culture, also key slides we share for steps people can take to become an ally to our focus group which are Brazilian colleagues at this time.\nhttps://www.dropbox.com/scl/fi/flelphitqougu4vthnfw3/Carta_Understanding_Brazilian_Work_Culture-2023.pptx?rlkey=03fioaykxsp8h0verq2lxsiyn&dl=0\nCarta_Understanding_Brazilian_Work_Culture-2023.pptx\nShared with Dropbox\nwww.dropbox.com\nPlease let\u00a0me\u00a0know if you have any trouble accessing the link above.

I appreciate the opportunities I have been presented due to the consistent light and excellence I have brought into the organization. I deeply value the professional relationships I've been able to develop here and the ability to present my skills on multiple platforms. However, due to the severe emotional distress I have undergone through uncertainty with the 20% pay reduction, unclear guidance from leadership about the specifics around how the company will rebound from the economic uncertainty, and growing job dissatisfaction I needed to make the best choice for my health and well-being. I remain committed to the health and wellness of my past, and current LCW colleagues and if the opportunity arises for me to partner with LCW in the future I hope you all would not hesitate to reach out. \n\u00a0\nPlease let me know if there is any way I can assist with the transition as I have ongoing client work that is in various stages of delivery. I hope to keep in touch.\n\u00a0\nWith compassion and gratitude,\n\u00a0\nEmani Richmond\n(she/her/hers)\nConsultant\nLCW\nWebsite\n\u00a0\n|\n\u00a0\nTwitter\n \n|\n\u00a0\nFacebook\n\u00a0\n|\n\u00a0\nLinkedIn\nView our upcoming events\n | \nSign-up for our newsletter",

Here\u2019s an update on all the current projects. Be warned: it\u2019s a long read!\nThe Audiobook\nI started the month by recording the audio for the audiobook of \nI\u2019m Tired of Racism\n. At the time of writing, I\u2019d just received the files from the sound engineer, so I\u2019ll be checking those so all edits can be finalised. \nI\u2019ve also been in touch with the person I hope will do the audiobook cover, and I\u2019ve started setting up my ACX account. That means everything\u2019s on track for a release sometime in November. \nThat will officially end the production phase for this book, which will be quite something after working on it in various guises for a solid three years.\nBarbados Book Launch\nKathie Daniel of \nSouthpaw Grafix \nin Barbados is helping me plan the local launch of my book on October 28th. As always, I\u2019m doing it on a shoestring, which probably means an intimate audience of no more than 70 people - good numbers for a local launch, I\u2019m told. \nWith just under a month to go at the time of writing, it\u2019s all systems go, and making hard decisions about what\u2019s essential and what\u2019s simply nice to have. By the time I write the next letter, it will be over, and I\u2019ll be able to update you on how it went. \nThe Milwaukee Trip\nLea and I went to Milwaukee to attend YWCA SEW\u2019s Circle of Women event. It was an interesting experience, with much to think about regarding what putting equality into practice really looks like. ...\nSubscribe to Sharon's Anti-Racism Newsletter to read the rest.\nBecome a paying subscriber of Sharon's Anti-Racism Newsletter to get access to this post and other subscriber-only content.\nUpgrade to paid\nA subscription gets you:\nThe SARN podcast, with Sharon's short takes on anti-racism issues\nA monthly behind-the-scenes update from Sharon, plus early access to some content\nAccess to the FULL archive of 300+ posts - no more paywall!\n\u00a0\nLike\nComment\nRestack\n\u00a0\n\u00a9 2023 \nSharon Hurley Hall\n60 Sunrise Drive, Southern Heights, Christ Church, Barbados BB17096 \nUnsubscribe",

I usually don\u00b4t have slides uncovered at my presentations, as my experience showed me that it leaves a feeling that the presentation was unprepared and finished missing subjects. Nevertheless, it should be your call, if you want me to have a longer material, it\u00b4s OK for me.\n\u00a0\nOne of the subjects they pointed is the difference between the work laws in Brazil and the US. This isn\u00b4t material for a Diversity training (maybe HR?) and I have no familiarity with the subject, as I don\u00b4t know the laws in the US. I\u00b4ll mention some things like the \u201cworker\u00b4s rights\u201d in Brazil, but won\u00b4t write about it, OK? \n\u00a0\nI\u00b4m eager for your feedback on the \u201ctone\u201d I\u00b4m using, so I\u00b4m sending you the first five slides, OK?\n\u00a0\nThank you for your help!\n\u00a0\nHugs and kisses\nLucy\nPS.

    "body": "Four tips to beat it and get back to feeling like you.\nView this email in your browser.\n\u00a0\nPresented by CVS Health\nSigns you\u2019re suffering from social exhaustion\u2014and 4 tips to beat it\nOctober 1, 2023\n\u200a\nAfter more than two years of soft pants, Zoom meetings, and virtual one-on-ones, returning to the office half- or full-time may be somewhat of a shock to the system. If you\u2019re feeling cranky, exhausted, and in need of some alone time, you may be experiencing social exhaustion, according to psychologists. \nWhat is social exhaustion?\nIt generally refers to feeling run-down and overstimulated after spending time with others. There are a few signs that may indicate you\u2019re falling prey to social burnout: You may feel irritable, impatient, or notice that you no longer find joy in social outings like you used to, says Camille Tenerife, a Los Angeles\u2013based therapist. \nWhile social exhaustion may be the product of work\u2014navigating coffee-pot conversations, a calendar stacked with meetings, and office happy hours\u2014it can create ripples in all areas of your life. So as you\u2019re getting back into the swing of your morning commute, cubicle chats, and IRL meetings, make sure you have a few therapist-approved tips to prevent those in-office days from draining your social battery.\n1. Set realistic social expectations for yourself \n\u00a0\nGive yourself permission to let one or more things go. Maybe you hire a babysitter to pick up your child from school, skip happy hour with your friends, or put those French lessons on hold for now.\n2. Carve out time on your calendar to unwind\n\u00a0\n\u201cJust as much as you block out the meetings and the one-on-ones, also block out time to decompress in your calendar if work allows you to,\u201d says Tenerife . Use that time to take a walk, meditate, or drink a coffee. \n3. Recognize social exhaustion at work\u2014and do one small self-care ritual\n\u00a0\nLet\u2019s set the scene: It\u2019s the middle of the workday, and you just wrapped up your fifth meeting.

I marveled at the collective knowledge in the room and basked in the encouragement and idea sharing that comes when we get out of our silos long enough to engage with other assistants who \u201cget it\u201d.\nThis got me thinking about how many times I\u2019ve relied on (and helped) those in my network.

Think about the doorman or security personnel you encounter regularly, the cleaning crew you greet in your office building, and the vendors you interact with.

I appreciate the opportunities I have been presented due to the consistent light and excellence I have brought into the organization. I deeply value the professional relationships I've been able to develop here and the ability to present my skills on multiple platforms. However, due to the severe emotional distress I have undergone through uncertainty with the 20% pay reduction, unclear guidance from leadership about the specifics around how the company will rebound from the economic uncertainty, and growing job dissatisfaction I needed to make the best choice for my health and well-being. I remain committed to the health and wellness of my past, and current LCW colleagues and if the opportunity arises for me to partner with LCW in the future I hope you all would not hesitate to reach out. \n\u00a0\nPlease let me know if there is any way I can assist with the transition as I have ongoing client work that is in various stages of delivery. I hope to keep in touch.\n\u00a0\nWith compassion and gratitude,\n\u00a0\nEmani Richmond\n(she/her/hers)\nConsultant\nLCW\nWebsite\n\u00a0\n|\n\u00a0\nTwitter\n \n|\n\u00a0\nFacebook\n\u00a0\n|\n\u00a0\nLinkedIn\nView our upcoming events\n | \nSign-up for our newsletter",

I appreciate the opportunities I have been presented due to the consistent light and excellence I have brought into the organization. I deeply value the professional relationships I've been able to develop here and the ability to present my skills on multiple platforms. However, due to the severe emotional distress I have undergone through uncertainty with the 20% pay reduction, unclear guidance from leadership about the specifics around how the company will rebound from the economic uncertainty, and growing job dissatisfaction I needed to make the best choice for my health and well-being. I remain committed to the health and wellness of my past, and current LCW colleagues and if the opportunity arises for me to partner with LCW in the future I hope you all would not hesitate to reach out. \n\u00a0\nPlease let me know if there is any way I can assist with the transition as I have ongoing client work that is in various stages of delivery. I hope to keep in touch.\n\u00a0\nWith compassion and gratitude,\n\u00a0\nEmani Richmond\n(she/her/hers)\nConsultant\nLCW\nWebsite\n\u00a0\n|\n\u00a0\nTwitter\n \n|\n\u00a0\nFacebook\n\u00a0\n|\n\u00a0\nLinkedIn\nView our upcoming events\n | \nSign-up for our newsletter",

If this is too soon, we have another monthly all-staff informal virtual gathering we call \u201ccoffee & connect\u201d on Tuesday, 10/17, 9:00-9:30am. This pattern continues all year, 60 minute all-staff first Tuesday/month and 30 minute coffee & connect on the third Tuesday/month. The coffee & connects usually don\u2019t have an agenda/topic, but occasionally there is a topic and I let staff know in this case so they are sure to hop on Teams.\nI\u2019m open to pushing back roll-out to late October or late November with content starting at the following all-staff if that works better to have plans in place rather than rush.\nI added a few thoughts and questions in red below on planned toolkit structure. Let me know what you think is best on timing and happy to meet anytime to continue planning.\nThank you!\nAnn\n\u00a0\nFrom:\n Emani Richmond <\ne.richmond@lcwmail.com\n> \nSent:\n Thursday, September 21, 2023 5:50 PM\nTo:\n Ann Odens <\nann@childrensheartlink.org\n>\nSubject:\n RE: Discounted Talent Review Bundles\n\u00a0\nHey Ann,\nI\u2019m really excited for the program we are bringing together for CHL. The opportunities I presented would be in addition to the scope of work we have already began for the fall on through next year. What is the date of the October All-Staff?\nDuring the course roll out in October would be an opportunity to remind staff of the cultural/ DEI program you folks completed last year. Also this can get them thinking about what they hope to receive from this year\u2019s engagement in preparation for the toolkit introduction session. \nHere are the 6 topic areas that the Intercultural Toolkit will address:\nIntroduction and how to use the toolkit\nIntercultural Goal setting: What do you hope to gain and leverage during this journey?\nLooking Back: Reflecting on cultural experiences to increase self-awareness\nValues & Behaviors: How do they show up in my cultures and how might they show up in other cultures?\nLeveraging Diversity: Pick 1-2 people on your team that you don\u2019t know well and commit to understanding how they want to be treated. \nCultural Literacy: Using Dimensions of Difference select 1-3 cultures to research and identify the behaviors you may see based on their designation. \nLet me think about how we will roll this out to the team specifically when they will get access to which course elements. \n\u00a0\nAlso, just so we are aligned on the contents of the current statement of work, CHL has currently purchased 20 seats for one of our eLearning courses titled: Managing with Intercultural Competence. My goal was to make this course available to CHL at the beginning of the engagement so staff could receive a refresher of key DEI, culture terminology, also to practice the DIN Model using the case study featured. Luckily LCW has recently went through a rebrand so you folks will be receiving a newly updated course. \nLet me think about how we will roll this out to the team and I can get back to you on specifics regarding when staff will complete each component, similar to a roadmap. \n\u00a0\nCurrently, the toolkit is outlined and includes the following structure:\nTopic area with a supporting reading-\nStep 1\nPre-work for the meeting: \n1 week prior to all-staff meeting (?), email to staff with topic, supporting reading and pre-work.\n\u00a0\nTeam questions-\nStep 2\nFor discussion during the monthly meeting: \nAt all-staff meeting at start of month have small group discussions with guided questions, 15 minutes (?). Do we include debrief at this time or tell staff that more discussion will take place at each of their department meetings? Departments meet throughout that month can continue discussions, will you provide guided questions for department discussions during the month?\nSpace for reflection-\nStep 3\nTo collect data throughout the process: \nWhat does data collection look like? How do we \u201cclose-out\u201d topic for the month? Is there a way to collect individual feedback without meeting again and then provide topic wrap up? Would we do a monthly email 1 week prior to all-staff with current topic closing thoughts and return to step 1 of sharing next month topic/reading material/pre-work? Of course, no topic is ever done or closed, but to continue through monthly topics and steps, wondering how to somewhat end topic and move to next.\nI will schedule some time for us to connect next week so you can receive a visual to communicate the timeline to staff, also to chart out our next steps with the roll out. \nI hope you are well, and we look forward to continuing our partnership with CHL.\n\u00a0\nThank you,\nEmani Richmond\n(she/her/hers)\nConsultant\nLCW\nWebsite\n\u00a0\n|\n\u00a0\nTwitter\n \n|\n\u00a0\nFacebook\n\u00a0\n|\n\u00a0\nLinkedIn\nView our upcoming events\n | \nSign-up for our newsletter\n\u00a0\nFrom:\n Ann Odens <\nann@childrensheartlink.org\n> \nSent:\n Wednesday, September 20, 2023 2:54 PM\nTo:\n Emani Richmond <\ne.richmond@lcwmail.com\n>\nSubject:\n RE: Discounted Talent Review Bundles\n\u00a0\nHi Emani,\nThank you for sharing these opportunities. Are these part of the contract for Children\u2019s HeartLink or would one of these options be added to our plan?\nI know it\u2019s been a while since we connected on next steps for our team and wondering if we could meet to touch base. I think we talked about kicking off trainings for the year at our October all-staff meeting, which is creeping right up!\nMy understanding of plans:\nKick-off at October staff meeting explaining goals, plans, timeline. Is there information and an image or video I can share with staff when sharing plans for the next 6 months?\nImplement Leadership Toolkit with new topic monthly:\nPart 1: LCW facilitated walk-through (How long? When? Beginning of November?) \nPart 2: Monthly CHL guided discussions at monthly team meetings. Topics and discussion questions provided by LCW. Should we introduce new topic at monthly staff meetings and have initial discussions at that time?\nIntercultural Competence Toolkit:\nPart 1: Monthly eLearning done individually by CHL staff. How long is each eLearning? Will we pre-select eLearning sessions for staff do each month to tie-in to monthly discussion topic? How do staff access the learning platform?\nLCW consulting hours that allow CHL team to check-in with LCW quarterly to see what cultural competence questions surface. Is this check-in structured time with me and Jackie or more of open session for all staff to ask questions of an LCW consultant?\nWhere do we tie-in a review of their own IDI results and inform staff that this next set of training aligns with IDI work done last year?\nClearly I have many questions and not sure if my understanding of the overall process is correct. Happy to talk with you any time to keep the training moving forward.\nThank you,\nAnn\nAnn Odens\nDirector of Operations and HR\nChildren\u2019s HeartLink\n952.237.5510\nwww.childrensheartlink.org\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\nFrom:\n Emani Richmond <\ne.richmond@lcwmail.com\n> \nSent:\n Thursday, September 7, 2023 9:10 AM\nTo:\n Ann Odens <\nann@childrensheartlink.org\n>\nSubject:\n Discounted Talent Review Bundles\n\u00a0\nHi Ann,\n\u00a0\nI hope you\u2019re feeling alive and well.

This week we\u2019re celebrating vegetables, moving more to help brain health and thinking about dating in our golden years. Plus we\u2019ve got our weekly \u201cjoy\u201d snacks. But before that \u2026\nThis week\u2019s must-reads:\nEven exercisers need to track their \u201csitting\u201d time. \nHere\u2019s why.\nA family secret fueled his OCD.

Eleven Madison Park in New York was once named the best in the world and was famous for its mouthwatering duck and lobster dishes.\n \nChef Daniel Humm prepares plant-based dishes at Eleven Madison Park in New York. (Ye Fan)\nWhile some restaurant reviewers mocked the choice, others celebrated the chef\u2019s creative shift. I recently spoke to Humm about what he\u2019s learned from the experience, how he\u2019s changed his personal eating habits, why he doesn\u2019t like the word \u201cvegan\u201d and his advice for those of us who want to focus on plant-based eating but are having trouble making the full commitment. Here\u2019s our conversation, which has been edited for brevity and clarity.\nADVERTISEMENT\n \n \n \n\u00a0\nQ. \nWhat\u2019s wrong with the word \u2018vegan\u2019?\nA:\n \nWe want to stay away from the word vegan because I think it just comes with so many rules. I think it\u2019s more beautiful to say plant-based. Creatively, we love to work with vegetables. They are full of opportunities and excitement. That\u2019s what this has been for us. Cooking with vegetables has been really eye-opening.\nQ: \nWas it hard to make the shift?\nA:\n In the beginning, it was scary to leave so many things behind that we perfected and we were known for. I felt like it could be limiting to a certain degree. But today, I feel like we were limited before. For the main course, everyone expected lobster or another protein. With vegetables, there are thousands of opportunities, and before there were only about five.\n \nDaniel Humm, chef and owner of Eleven Madison Park in New York, prepares carrot. (Fecks Wagtouicz)\nQ: \nWhat\u2019s your advice for home cooks who want to make more plant-based meals?\nA:\n When choosing your ingredients, really be thoughtful about seasonality. That\u2019s a privilege if you get access to seasonal ingredients.\nHave a few go-to dishes you like to make. At home, I cook plant-based, and it really does take a little bit of rethinking. I have a beautiful clay donabe (a Japanese cooking pot) that I use to cook rice. I add steamed eggplant, beautiful herbs and onions. When you\u2019ve done it once or twice, it becomes second nature and the easiest thing.\nAs a home cook, I think it\u2019s important to take inspiration from other cuisines \u2014 Lebanese, Israeli, Moroccan, Japanese. Get a few of those cookbooks. As soon as you get into it, you won\u2019t be able to stop because you realize how delicious it is and how good you feel on top of it.\nQ:\n I think people worry that adding dips or sauces to vegetables makes them less healthful. What do you think?\nA:\n \nNot only do kids need dips, adults also need the dips. There is this preconceived notion that vegetables are boring. That\u2019s why I thought it was important for a restaurant like ours to do this. I believe things can change when one of the great restaurants is saying that eating eggplant or zucchini is the highest form of dining. We do need to make vegetables exciting and magical because they are.\n \n(Photo by Scott Suchman for The Washington Post; food styling by Lisa Cherkasky for The Washington Post)\nThe best foods to feed your gut microbiome\nYour gut microbiome influences your mental health, heart risk, weight gain and sleep.

People often think that older adults fall in love less intensely, without the giddiness and sheen of youthful infatuation. But falling in love as an older person involves the same group of neurons in our brain as it does in younger adults, researchers say.\nThat, however, may be where the similarity between young and older dating ends.\nDating over 50 certainly has its challenges \u2014 the pool of potential dates is smaller than in our younger years, and many older adults struggle to find connection. But relationship experts and over-50 daters say there are surprising benefits.\nThere\u2019s no pressure to procreate or find the perfect future parent. Many people in the pool are divorced or widowed, bringing with them hard-won lessons about how not to behave in a relationship. And older daters tend to know what they want \u2014 and understand the dealbreakers \u2014 allowing them to be more selective.\n\u201cPeople at 50 know there\u2019s a good chance that they will live another 30 years,\u201d said Francine Russo, author of \u201cLove After 50: How to Find It, Enjoy It, and Keep It.\u201d \u201cAnd if they\u2019re in a relationship which is not satisfying, they think, \u2018I don\u2019t want this, I want something better for myself.\u2019\u201d\nTo learn more about dating in your golden years, read the full story:\n \n(Chelsea Conrad/The Washington Post)\nThe new rules of dating after 50: Less pressure and more picky\nThe \u201cGolden Bachelor\u201d may learn that the brain reacts to love the same way at any age, but older adults can be more selective when choosing a partner\nBy Rebecca Fishbein\nRead more\n \n\u00a0\nABC\u2019s \u2018Golden Bachelor\u2019 gives senior dating a rare moment in the spotlight\nABC's new 'Golden Bachelor,' Gerry Turner, is 71 and a widower.

    "body": "And how to enjoy them in your diet.\nView this email in your browser.\n\u00a0\nPresented by CVS Health\n3 foods in this Costa Rican blue zone diet that help residents live to 100\nSeptember 28, 2023\n\u200a\nSix areas across the globe are known as \nthe blue zones\n, where a combination of culture, mindset, diet, and environment help their residents live longer and healthier lives than most.\u00a0\n\u00a0\nThe residents of Nicoya, Costa Rica\u2014known for its coastal views south of the Nicaraguan border\u2014have routinely enjoyed three foods together for at least 6,000 years old, Dan Buettner, the Blue Zones LLC founder shares in his recent docuseries \nLive to 100\n on Netflix.\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u201cWithout a doubt one of the reasons people in Nicoya are living a long time is because they are eating this diet of beans, squash, and corn,\u201d Buettner says in the film. \u201cThey call it the three sisters.\u201d\u00a0\n\u00a0\nHere are their health benefits and tips to add them to your diet:\n\u00a0\n1. Corn\n\u00a0\nIn Nicoya, families have traditionally made tortillas by soaking corn kernels in\u00a0 wood ash.\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u201cThe traditional processing of corn boosts the nutritional value,\u201d Buettner says in the film.\u00a0\n\u00a0\nThe tortillas are high in complex carbohydrates, integral for maintaining energy. Corn by itself is also rich in fiber, so it will digest slowly and keep you satiated.\u00a0\n\u00a0\nHow to eat it: \nAdd corn to salsas, salads, or vegetable chili.\u00a0\n\u00a0\n2. Beans\n\u00a0\nBlack beans contain antioxidants, which strengthen the immune system, Buettner says in the film. They are also a substantial source of fiber, which helps regulate blood sugar, and muscle-building protein.\u00a0\n\u00a0\nBuettner champions a daily dose of beans in his book, \nThe Blue Zones American Kitchen: 100 Recipes to Live to 100\n, and they\u2019re featured in many of its recipes.\u00a0\n\u00a0\nHow to eat it: \nIn soups, in tacos, or by themselves.\n\u00a0\n3. Squash\n\u00a0\nSquash is rich in vitamins A, B, and C, as well as magnesium and potassium, which are critical for bone, blood, and heart health, according to the \nCleveland Clinic\n. Their antioxidants also help \nreduce oxidative stress\n, which can cause cell damage and disease.\u00a0\n \n\u00a0\nAdding seasonal squash to your next dish can be a great way to start incorporating it into your diet. Fall varieties include butternut, acorn, and spaghetti squash.\u00a0\n\u00a0\nHow to eat it:\n Roast them for a side dish or fill them with other vegetables and grains, like quinoa and tomatoes.\u00a0\n\u00a0\nRead Alexa Mikhail\u2019s full article \nhere\n.\n\u200a\nWhat is Medicare?

If this is too soon, we have another monthly all-staff informal virtual gathering we call \u201ccoffee & connect\u201d on Tuesday, 10/17, 9:00-9:30am. This pattern continues all year, 60 minute all-staff first Tuesday/month and 30 minute coffee & connect on the third Tuesday/month. The coffee & connects usually don\u2019t have an agenda/topic, but occasionally there is a topic and I let staff know in this case so they are sure to hop on Teams.\nI\u2019m open to pushing back roll-out to late October or late November with content starting at the following all-staff if that works better to have plans in place rather than rush.\nI added a few thoughts and questions in red below on planned toolkit structure. Let me know what you think is best on timing and happy to meet anytime to continue planning.\nThank you!\nAnn\n\u00a0\nFrom:\n Emani Richmond <\ne.richmond@lcwmail.com\n> \nSent:\n Thursday, September 21, 2023 5:50 PM\nTo:\n Ann Odens <\nann@childrensheartlink.org\n>\nSubject:\n RE: Discounted Talent Review Bundles\n\u00a0\nHey Ann,\nI\u2019m really excited for the program we are bringing together for CHL. The opportunities I presented would be in addition to the scope of work we have already began for the fall on through next year. What is the date of the October All-Staff?\nDuring the course roll out in October would be an opportunity to remind staff of the cultural/ DEI program you folks completed last year. Also this can get them thinking about what they hope to receive from this year\u2019s engagement in preparation for the toolkit introduction session. \nHere are the 6 topic areas that the Intercultural Toolkit will address:\nIntroduction and how to use the toolkit\nIntercultural Goal setting: What do you hope to gain and leverage during this journey?\nLooking Back: Reflecting on cultural experiences to increase self-awareness\nValues & Behaviors: How do they show up in my cultures and how might they show up in other cultures?\nLeveraging Diversity: Pick 1-2 people on your team that you don\u2019t know well and commit to understanding how they want to be treated. \nCultural Literacy: Using Dimensions of Difference select 1-3 cultures to research and identify the behaviors you may see based on their designation. \nLet me think about how we will roll this out to the team specifically when they will get access to which course elements. \n\u00a0\nAlso, just so we are aligned on the contents of the current statement of work, CHL has currently purchased 20 seats for one of our eLearning courses titled: Managing with Intercultural Competence. My goal was to make this course available to CHL at the beginning of the engagement so staff could receive a refresher of key DEI, culture terminology, also to practice the DIN Model using the case study featured. Luckily LCW has recently went through a rebrand so you folks will be receiving a newly updated course. \nLet me think about how we will roll this out to the team and I can get back to you on specifics regarding when staff will complete each component, similar to a roadmap. \n\u00a0\nCurrently, the toolkit is outlined and includes the following structure:\nTopic area with a supporting reading-\nStep 1\nPre-work for the meeting: \n1 week prior to all-staff meeting (?), email to staff with topic, supporting reading and pre-work.\n\u00a0\nTeam questions-\nStep 2\nFor discussion during the monthly meeting: \nAt all-staff meeting at start of month have small group discussions with guided questions, 15 minutes (?). Do we include debrief at this time or tell staff that more discussion will take place at each of their department meetings? Departments meet throughout that month can continue discussions, will you provide guided questions for department discussions during the month?\nSpace for reflection-\nStep 3\nTo collect data throughout the process: \nWhat does data collection look like? How do we \u201cclose-out\u201d topic for the month? Is there a way to collect individual feedback without meeting again and then provide topic wrap up? Would we do a monthly email 1 week prior to all-staff with current topic closing thoughts and return to step 1 of sharing next month topic/reading material/pre-work? Of course, no topic is ever done or closed, but to continue through monthly topics and steps, wondering how to somewhat end topic and move to next.\nI will schedule some time for us to connect next week so you can receive a visual to communicate the timeline to staff, also to chart out our next steps with the roll out. \nI hope you are well, and we look forward to continuing our partnership with CHL.\n\u00a0\nThank you,\nEmani Richmond\n(she/her/hers)\nConsultant\nLCW\nWebsite\n\u00a0\n|\n\u00a0\nTwitter\n \n|\n\u00a0\nFacebook\n\u00a0\n|\n\u00a0\nLinkedIn\nView our upcoming events\n | \nSign-up for our newsletter\n\u00a0\nFrom:\n Ann Odens <\nann@childrensheartlink.org\n> \nSent:\n Wednesday, September 20, 2023 2:54 PM\nTo:\n Emani Richmond <\ne.richmond@lcwmail.com\n>\nSubject:\n RE: Discounted Talent Review Bundles\n\u00a0\nHi Emani,\nThank you for sharing these opportunities. Are these part of the contract for Children\u2019s HeartLink or would one of these options be added to our plan?\nI know it\u2019s been a while since we connected on next steps for our team and wondering if we could meet to touch base. I think we talked about kicking off trainings for the year at our October all-staff meeting, which is creeping right up!\nMy understanding of plans:\nKick-off at October staff meeting explaining goals, plans, timeline. Is there information and an image or video I can share with staff when sharing plans for the next 6 months?\nImplement Leadership Toolkit with new topic monthly:\nPart 1: LCW facilitated walk-through (How long? When? Beginning of November?) \nPart 2: Monthly CHL guided discussions at monthly team meetings. Topics and discussion questions provided by LCW. Should we introduce new topic at monthly staff meetings and have initial discussions at that time?\nIntercultural Competence Toolkit:\nPart 1: Monthly eLearning done individually by CHL staff. How long is each eLearning? Will we pre-select eLearning sessions for staff do each month to tie-in to monthly discussion topic? How do staff access the learning platform?\nLCW consulting hours that allow CHL team to check-in with LCW quarterly to see what cultural competence questions surface. Is this check-in structured time with me and Jackie or more of open session for all staff to ask questions of an LCW consultant?\nWhere do we tie-in a review of their own IDI results and inform staff that this next set of training aligns with IDI work done last year?\nClearly I have many questions and not sure if my understanding of the overall process is correct. Happy to talk with you any time to keep the training moving forward.\nThank you,\nAnn\nAnn Odens\nDirector of Operations and HR\nChildren\u2019s HeartLink\n952.237.5510\nwww.childrensheartlink.org\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\nFrom:\n Emani Richmond <\ne.richmond@lcwmail.com\n> \nSent:\n Thursday, September 7, 2023 9:10 AM\nTo:\n Ann Odens <\nann@childrensheartlink.org\n>\nSubject:\n Discounted Talent Review Bundles\n\u00a0\nHi Ann,\n\u00a0\nI hope you\u2019re feeling alive and well.
