Along with language, we learn how our bodies communicate, and - early in our lives, we begin to make sense of social relations through attire, we teach and learn what \u201cappropriate\" means: we dress for the weather and for socialization. Our expectations about someone's appearance may say more about ourselves than about that individual. The challenge lies in be(com)ing aware of our own values and assumptions. Our deeply ingrained value settings kick in every time we (un)consciously connect to others through dress codes. Failing to decode implicit values may be perceived as \u201ccultural illiteracy\u201d.

The expectations are high, and the questions\u2014from the board and the C-suite\u2014are more complex, and ever more frequent.\n\u00a0\nAt the center of it all is the chief information officer.

These are the leaders who are propelling transformative technologies that can generate significant value to shareholders.\n\u00a0\nBeginning Feb. 28, a new \nFortune\n newsletter, \nCIO Intelligence\n, will explore the key issues shaping the roles of CIOs and other technology leaders. The newsletter will explore topics ranging from generative AI projects to the cloud vs. on-premise debate; tech talent and technical debt; and the protection of sensitive data as fraudsters utilize AI at wider scale and with sharper precision.\u00a0\n \n\u00a0\nMy name is John Kell, and I\u2019m thrilled to begin writing this newsletter every Wednesday from New York, where I\u2019ve also frequently covered the generative AI boom that\u2019s got everyone talking.

I'm Sara and I work as a Platform Specialist at Promote. I'm reaching out to see if you or one of your colleagues would be interested in our learning platform.\u00a0\nTo make this message a bit more engaging I'm trying something new - so here comes a superhero saga about Promote and You...\nIn a world where training programs often fall short of their true potential, there emerges a champion from the shadows of conventional learning platforms, a guardian of knowledge transfer, and a beacon of innovation: The Promote Platform. This isn't just any hero; it's the superhero the training world desperately needs. Let's dive into the saga of Promote, the Superhero of Training Providers.\nOrigin Story\nIn the bustling metropolis of Learning and Development, where challenges loom large and the quest for impact and engagement never ceases, Promote was forged. Conceived by the minds at Promote International, this platform was imbued with extraordinary powers to combat the forces of ineffective training and disengagement. Its mission: is to revolutionize how knowledge is applied in the real world.\nPowers and Abilities\nPromote's strength lies in \n40+ years of research on effective learning methodologies.\nAn approach focusing on driving behavior change and creating learning journeys for maximum impact.\nNo superhero is complete without a sid\nekick, and Promote's AI features are the perfect companion.\n \nThis AI works tirelessly behind the scenes, optimizing the learning experience, saving precious time, and uncovering insights that lead to better strategies and outcomes.\nJoin the League of Extraordinary Training Programs\nPromote, with its unique blend of powers, invites training providers to become part of a new era. An era where training is not just a task but a transformative journey. Where every program launched has the potential to change the professional landscape, empower individuals, and shape the future of organizations.\nA Beacon of Hope and Excellence\nAs the saga of Promote continues, it stands as a beacon of hope in the Learning and Development universe. Its legacy is not just in the programs it has transformed but in the countless professionals it has empowered, the leaders it has created, and the communities it has built.\nIn a world craving impact, engagement, and real transformation, The Promote Platform emerges not just as a superhero but as a symbol of what's possible when innovation, commitment, and the right tools come together to redefine the future of training.\nSo, as the sun sets over the skyline of the training world, one thing is clear: \nwith Promote by your side, you are no longer just educators; you are heroes, equipped to lead learners into a future where knowledge is not just acquired but lived, breathed, and applied.\n The adventure has just begun.\nMaybe a little bit corny but I hope the message got through :)\nAre you interested in trying the platform? I'd be happy to schedule a short demo. Alternatively, you can\u00a0\n \ntake a look at it here\n \n:\u00a0\n \nhttps://promoteint.com/sv/en/training-provider-try-platform/\nI am looking forward to hearing from you!\nHave a great\u00a0day!\nKind regards from a snowy Sweden,\nSara Lundkvist\nPromote Platform Specialist\nPromote International\nSlussplan 9\n111 30 Stockholm, Sweden\nTry the platform\nwww.promoteint.com\n \nMessage sent by Promote International at Slussplan 9, 111 30 Stockholm, Stockholms l\u00e4n, Sweden. \n\u00a0 Don't want to receive emails from us?

That transition will bring new features and functionality, along with two changes that we wanted to give a heads up on:\nWe\u2019re updating our browser permissions request\n.\nIf you\u2019re using our extension on Chrome, Firefox, or Edge, you\u2019ll be asked to confirm an updated set of permissions. These permissions will make our extension even easier to access, no matter where you\u2019re working on the web. You deserve transparency around anything related to your privacy and security \u2014 that\u2019s why we\u2019ve outlined \nhow we will (and won\u2019t) use these new permissions\n and how admins can apply customizations or restrictions at an organization level.\nWe\u2019re updating the way starring (or favoriting) works\n.\nCurrently, you can favorite both main scheduling pages (including team pages) and event scheduling pages. \nView a quick visual comparison\n of the two. Soon, you\u2019ll no longer be able to favorite main scheduling pages, but you \nwill\n still be able to favorite event scheduling pages. We recommend you revisit any main scheduling pages you have starred, if any, and bookmark them in your browser or switch to favoriting event scheduling pages instead.\nQuestions, comments, or feedback? We\u2019re all ears \u2014 reply to let us know.\nHappy scheduling,\nThe Calendly Team \nThis is an essential product communication, which is why you're receiving this even if you've unsubscribed from Marketing emails.\nSent from Calendly\n115 E.

However, many of the people who reach out to you on LinkedIn do.\nThe \u201cside hustles\u201d to create another revenue stream in 2022 are now the necessary protection you need in an uncertain economy in 2024.\nJoin me and thousands of others, and \nconnect your Calendly to PayPal or Stripe and start charging for meetings\n (available on the \nStandard subscription plan\n and higher).\nYou don\u2019t need to request people pay for every meeting if you have \nmultiple event types\n that you offer, but reserve one event type with \nPayPal\n or \nStripe\n integrated \u2013 just in case. \nCharge for Meetings\nBack That Event Type Up\nAs you know, Calendly Event Types are how you offer your attendees blocks of time to meet with you (e.g., 30-minute video call, 15-minute in-person visit, 45-minute paid consultation).\nSometimes you need a little backup when coordinating meetings. That\u2019s why we recently expanded \nevent type permissions\n, allowing you to add editors and viewers to your own events \nand\n admin-managed events!\nCollaborators can make event updates that help you deliver the best customer and candidate experience, prepare event types for you to speed up scheduling, and share event links on your behalf for a seamless handoff.\nTry Permissions\nImproved Collective and Round Robin Event Types\nWhen I ask people in companies what their favorite Calendly feature is, they generally say our \ncollaborative scheduling features\n to schedule better together as a team.\nThese team-scheduling pros wanted more, though. Dozens of them emailed asking for the ability to share meetings among groups of coworkers, or what we call \nCollective \nplus\n Round Robin\n.\nAvailable on the \nTeams and Enterprise subscription plans\n, you can now mix and match Collective and Round Robin capabilities to easily get a combination of teammates scheduled. For example, you can improve: \nProduct demos to prospects:\n Set up an event type with an account executive plus one of five rotating sales engineers\nPanel interviews:\n Pair a hiring manager with one of three rotating team leaders plus one of four rotating peers interviewers\nNew customer onboarding calls:\n Include a sales manager who closed the deal plus their assigned customer success manager and one of four rotating technical implementation specialists\nTry Collective and Round Robin\nJoin Your Calendly Community\nHave you ever wanted to \nmeet other Calendly users\n? What about ask them questions? Or answer theirs?

I rarely check LCW\u2019s email. Briza and I talked about disconnecting it entirely, but it might impact access to HubSpot or DropBox, so it is open for now.\n\u00a0\nRegarding your questions, several of the lists you see in HubSpot are not related to sales but are instead related to marketing. These lists will be in the marketing drive, and Jake and I coordinated the imports to set up mailing lists, etc. Also, some Excel spreadsheets are exports from previous CRMs and might be source files that have since been cleaned to be uploaded to HubSpot. You may recall that when I started, we had Insightly CRM, then we stopped using it, then I built out Scoro and imported Insightly data to that system and then exported it, etc. If it doesn\u2019t have a name like FD1, you can assume the content was cleaned and merged into HubSpot, most likely pulled from an earlier system.\n\u00a0\nI didn\u2019t realize you don\u2019t have access to my Dropbox folder \u2013 I thought all those folders were public. Let me look at it and see if there is anything I can do to help. At one point, I did create a private folder, which you might be referring to. That folder contains confidential information (such as HR); any lists or projects would be considered draft versions. However, access might help you if you need HR-related information. I will try sharing that with you as well.\n\u00a0\nI owe both you and Pedro an apology. The end of last year was a bit overwhelming, and I had to take on extra work, which caused me to fall behind on several projects. I still owe you the updated playbook, and HubSpot changes you mentioned below. If it is not too late to support you, I can get those to you next week. Please let me know if you\u2019d like me to move forward or if there is anything else I can do to support you.\n\u00a0\nKind regards,\n\u00a0\nMelissa\u00a0 \n\u00a0\n\u00a0\nC.

I moved that to SALES/sales ops/hubspot, for posterity. \u00a0Re: the Scoro source files, I unfortunately do not have access to the \u201cMelissa Neu\u201d folder under LCW Dropbox. \n\u00a0\nThen, re: the filtering process you outlined below with the screenshots \u2013 these are contacts that were imported into HubSpot after various conferences or marketing events, right?\u00a0 These are different from the imports from your SIDE PROJECT folder? Some filenames in this dropdown are self explanatory (e.g., \u201cFDO-2022\u201d), but some, like \u2018people export\u2019 or \u2018mailchimp set up import\u2019 \u2013 I\u2019m not sure what those are. \n\u00a0\nFinally and separately, on Nov 15 you emailed that by Monday Nov 20 you were going to share with me \u201can updated playbook with the HubSpot Instructions that you requested, have sent you a follow-up email to our last meeting with a few sources and clarifications \n(RP: that\u2019s what this email was, I assume?)\n, have the finalized consulting report view to you, and completed the final changes to the quote and proposal templates.\u201d\u00a0 Did I miss that?

Parrilla\n(she/her)\nHead of Client Solutions\nLCW\n\u00a0\nFrom:\n Melissa Neu <\nm.neu@lcwmail.com\n> \nSent:\n Tuesday, November 28, 2023 2:57 PM\nTo:\n Rebecca Parrilla <\nr.parrilla@lcwmail.com\n>\nCc:\n Pedro Seminario <\nP.seminario@lcwmail.com\n>\nSubject:\n HubSpot List Import Follow-up\n\u00a0\nDear Rebecca,\n\u00a0\nThinking about our most recent conversation, I wanted to clarify a few things about HubSpot and the lists we uploaded into the system. One of HubSpot's great tools is the ability to assign leads, contacts, and companies to sales reps. For our purposes, the list that the contact came from was less important than knowing who it was assigned to and what the BD associate's expectations were when working with that lead. Often, Hannah and Pedro never saw the source file, but I would alert them when an upload was complete.\n\u00a0\nNow that your team has fewer and different people, it is hard to see that different contacts were assigned to different folks for different reasons. Our team would meet on average three times a week to coordinate. Unless it impacted messaging, it wasn't always necessary for us to know which of the lists the prospective client came from. Similarly, each member of our team had a different focus. In other words, Pedro would be focused on promoting translations and eLearning, Hannah would focus on facilitations, and I would concentrate on finding enterprise-wide clients (multi-modal learning opportunities) and consulting opportunities. The team was focused on this because we had varying subject matter knowledge and tenure at LCW. It also worked on the team's strengths \u2013 Pedro has extensive translation experience (for example) and eLearning. \n\u00a0\nAs I mentioned, the lists were only relevant as they pertained to specific messaging in emails or marketing. For example, the Forum attendees were on a list because we campaigned pre- and post-event. In contrast, we always invited folks from our assigned warm leads list to the events or promotions because folks on this list had submitted a website inquiry to LCW in the past three years. That doesn't mean that the Forum folks didn't get other communication, but in this example, we needed to differentiate that group based on messaging. \n\u00a0\nTo this end, while the three of us haven't talked much about the website integration or marketing side of HubSpot, one of the critical features we took advantage of was how leads were routed from the web. As outlined above, we would get leads assigned to us based on the client's indicated need or area of interest.\n\u00a0\nTaking advantage of HubSpot's capacity for sequencing, we didn't often need to refer to lists once the imports happened. Nevertheless, I completely understand your needs. Ultimately, this long-winded email is meant to share the following:\n\u00a0\nWhat you found in Teams was a snapshot of working documents pre-HubSpot implementation. However, I was diligent in keeping source files for all the uploads. The source files are kept here: LCW Dropbox\\SIDE PROJECTS\\MELISSA\\CRM\\HubSpot\nPlease note there are iterations here, and the documents are explicitly formatted for upload.\nSome lists were cleaned and uploaded into Scoro first (such as the warm leads list.) By cleaning, we worked with the associate consultants and the intern to update all contact details, remove contacts that don't work at their job any longer, and either identify that person's replacement or find contact details for them in their new role (or both). If you ever want to look at those source files, you can find the Scoro uploads here: LCW Dropbox\\Melissa Neu\\Melissa's DropBox\\ME\\CRM.\nBesides the lists we used in HubSpot for specific campaigns, you can always pull a list based on a previously uploaded file through filters. Here are the steps:\nFrom the Contacts view, go to advanced filters: \n\u00a0\nClick on advanced filters and then click on add filters:\n\u00a0\nAfter you click on add filters, you will be given a list of options to filter by. You will want to select \"Import.\"\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\nAfter selecting import, you will be given a list of options, and you can choose to select any list by name. You can also choose more than one list at a time. \nAs soon as you click your list, the filter starts. Once filtered, you can assign these to someone, put them in a campaign, share them in a view, and/or put them into a list.\n\u00a0\nYou will notice that some lists were marketing lists; those source files are kept here: \\LCW Dropbox\\MARKETING\\HubSpot\\Set-up. Please note that some of these contacts are captured in other lists. These uploads, at times, were only changing settings to ensure that folks subscribed to the mailing list were tagged in HubSpot.\n\u00a0\nI hope that this information provides more clarity as to where the source files are and how the system operates. Let me know if you have any questions or need me to walk you through this information.\n\u00a0\nKind regards,\n\u00a0\nMelissa\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\nC.

    "body": "Hi Rebecca,\n\u00a0\nI sincerely apologize for not getting back to you sooner. I rarely check LCW\u2019s email. Briza and I talked about disconnecting it entirely, but it might impact access to HubSpot or DropBox, so it is open for now.\n\u00a0\nRegarding your questions, several of the lists you see in HubSpot are not related to sales but are instead related to marketing. These lists will be in the marketing drive, and Jake and I coordinated the imports to set up mailing lists, etc. Also, some Excel spreadsheets are exports from previous CRMs and might be source files that have since been cleaned to be uploaded to HubSpot. You may recall that when I started, we had Insightly CRM, then we stopped using it, then I built out Scoro and imported Insightly data to that system and then exported it, etc. If it doesn\u2019t have a name like FD1, you can assume the content was cleaned and merged into HubSpot, most likely pulled from an earlier system.\n\u00a0\nI didn\u2019t realize you don\u2019t have access to my Dropbox folder \u2013 I thought all those folders were public. Let me look at it and see if there is anything I can do to help. At one point, I did create a private folder, which you might be referring to. That folder contains confidential information (such as HR); any lists or projects would be considered draft versions. However, access might help you if you need HR-related information. I will try sharing that with you as well.\n\u00a0\nI owe both you and Pedro an apology. The end of last year was a bit overwhelming, and I had to take on extra work, which caused me to fall behind on several projects. I still owe you the updated playbook, and HubSpot changes you mentioned below. If it is not too late to support you, I can get those to you next week. Please let me know if you\u2019d like me to move forward or if there is anything else I can do to support you.\n\u00a0\nKind regards,\n\u00a0\nMelissa\u00a0 \n\u00a0\n\u00a0\nC.

I hope you had a lovely Thanksgiving, that your teaching and other things on your plate are going well, and that you\u2019re having a good holiday season so far!\n\u00a0\nRe your email below\u2026.\n\u00a0\nUnderstood re: prospect contacts and the lists they came from. \u00a0I still don\u2019t have a firm understanding on what each list represents but your categorization of what kinds of leads/prospects you pursued based on subject matter expertise, as well as based on specific messaging in emails or marketing, is helpful. \u00a0Plus you\u2019ve mentioned to me in the past that anything labeled \u2018warm leads\u2019 were leads that came in through the LCW website. \n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\nThanks for the directions re: the Teams lists and the location of the source files in your SIDE PROJECTS folder. I moved that to SALES/sales ops/hubspot, for posterity. \u00a0Re: the Scoro source files, I unfortunately do not have access to the \u201cMelissa Neu\u201d folder under LCW Dropbox. \n\u00a0\nThen, re: the filtering process you outlined below with the screenshots \u2013 these are contacts that were imported into HubSpot after various conferences or marketing events, right?\u00a0 These are different from the imports from your SIDE PROJECT folder? Some filenames in this dropdown are self explanatory (e.g., \u201cFDO-2022\u201d), but some, like \u2018people export\u2019 or \u2018mailchimp set up import\u2019 \u2013 I\u2019m not sure what those are. \n\u00a0\nFinally and separately, on Nov 15 you emailed that by Monday Nov 20 you were going to share with me \u201can updated playbook with the HubSpot Instructions that you requested, have sent you a follow-up email to our last meeting with a few sources and clarifications \n(RP: that\u2019s what this email was, I assume?)\n, have the finalized consulting report view to you, and completed the final changes to the quote and proposal templates.\u201d\u00a0 Did I miss that? I haven\u2019t seen it and I wanted to check. \u00a0\n\u00a0\nThank you!!\nRP\n\u00a0\nRebecca M. Parrilla\n(she/her)\nHead of Client Solutions\nLCW\n\u00a0\nFrom:\n Melissa Neu <\nm.neu@lcwmail.com\n> \nSent:\n Tuesday, November 28, 2023 2:57 PM\nTo:\n Rebecca Parrilla <\nr.parrilla@lcwmail.com\n>\nCc:\n Pedro Seminario <\nP.seminario@lcwmail.com\n>\nSubject:\n HubSpot List Import Follow-up\n\u00a0\nDear Rebecca,\n\u00a0\nThinking about our most recent conversation, I wanted to clarify a few things about HubSpot and the lists we uploaded into the system. One of HubSpot's great tools is the ability to assign leads, contacts, and companies to sales reps. For our purposes, the list that the contact came from was less important than knowing who it was assigned to and what the BD associate's expectations were when working with that lead. Often, Hannah and Pedro never saw the source file, but I would alert them when an upload was complete.\n\u00a0\nNow that your team has fewer and different people, it is hard to see that different contacts were assigned to different folks for different reasons. Our team would meet on average three times a week to coordinate. Unless it impacted messaging, it wasn't always necessary for us to know which of the lists the prospective client came from. Similarly, each member of our team had a different focus. In other words, Pedro would be focused on promoting translations and eLearning, Hannah would focus on facilitations, and I would concentrate on finding enterprise-wide clients (multi-modal learning opportunities) and consulting opportunities. The team was focused on this because we had varying subject matter knowledge and tenure at LCW. It also worked on the team's strengths \u2013 Pedro has extensive translation experience (for example) and eLearning. \n\u00a0\nAs I mentioned, the lists were only relevant as they pertained to specific messaging in emails or marketing. For example, the Forum attendees were on a list because we campaigned pre- and post-event. In contrast, we always invited folks from our assigned warm leads list to the events or promotions because folks on this list had submitted a website inquiry to LCW in the past three years. That doesn't mean that the Forum folks didn't get other communication, but in this example, we needed to differentiate that group based on messaging. \n\u00a0\nTo this end, while the three of us haven't talked much about the website integration or marketing side of HubSpot, one of the critical features we took advantage of was how leads were routed from the web. As outlined above, we would get leads assigned to us based on the client's indicated need or area of interest.\n\u00a0\nTaking advantage of HubSpot's capacity for sequencing, we didn't often need to refer to lists once the imports happened. Nevertheless, I completely understand your needs. Ultimately, this long-winded email is meant to share the following:\n\u00a0\nWhat you found in Teams was a snapshot of working documents pre-HubSpot implementation. However, I was diligent in keeping source files for all the uploads. The source files are kept here: LCW Dropbox\\SIDE PROJECTS\\MELISSA\\CRM\\HubSpot\nPlease note there are iterations here, and the documents are explicitly formatted for upload.\nSome lists were cleaned and uploaded into Scoro first (such as the warm leads list.) By cleaning, we worked with the associate consultants and the intern to update all contact details, remove contacts that don't work at their job any longer, and either identify that person's replacement or find contact details for them in their new role (or both). If you ever want to look at those source files, you can find the Scoro uploads here: LCW Dropbox\\Melissa Neu\\Melissa's DropBox\\ME\\CRM.\nBesides the lists we used in HubSpot for specific campaigns, you can always pull a list based on a previously uploaded file through filters. Here are the steps:\nFrom the Contacts view, go to advanced filters: \n\u00a0\nClick on advanced filters and then click on add filters:\n\u00a0\nAfter you click on add filters, you will be given a list of options to filter by. You will want to select \"Import.\"\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\nAfter selecting import, you will be given a list of options, and you can choose to select any list by name. You can also choose more than one list at a time. \nAs soon as you click your list, the filter starts. Once filtered, you can assign these to someone, put them in a campaign, share them in a view, and/or put them into a list.\n\u00a0\nYou will notice that some lists were marketing lists; those source files are kept here: \\LCW Dropbox\\MARKETING\\HubSpot\\Set-up. Please note that some of these contacts are captured in other lists. These uploads, at times, were only changing settings to ensure that folks subscribed to the mailing list were tagged in HubSpot.\n\u00a0\nI hope that this information provides more clarity as to where the source files are and how the system operates. Let me know if you have any questions or need me to walk you through this information.\n\u00a0\nKind regards,\n\u00a0\nMelissa\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\nC.

They each qualify for 3 credits\u00a0from SHRM and HRCI. \nVIRTUAL CONFERENCE\n \nJanuary 10:\u00a0A Fresh Commitment to a Culture of Well-Being\nWhile many employers recognize the connection between well-being and productivity, creating a healthy balance in the real world of work can be challenging. What are the key choices and thoughtful compromises that must be made for workers to thrive as well as produce? How can managers be trained to make the well-being of their workers a top priority? How can companies get a better sense of which benefits and rewards are most effective\u2013and encourage workers to take advantage of them?\u00a0\nRegister now\n.\nLIVE EVENT\n \nJanuary 24: Atlanta, GA -\u00a0Building a Culture for Workers and Companies to Thrive in Times of Change\nIn an era of digital transformation and rising employee expectations, companies will need to become even more attuned to the needs and aspirations of workers to keep them engaged and satisfied on their career paths. And in an environment of hybrid work and strained profits, employers will have to focus on making work both efficient and sustainable. How can companies do more with less, while maintaining employee well-being? What are the next frontiers in talent acquisition, employee benefits, learning and development, and diversity, equity, inclusion and belonging?\u00a0\nRegister now\n.\nWEBINAR\n \nFebruary 1:\u00a0How Lifestyle Spending Accounts (LSAs) Revitalize Benefits for the Most Employee Flexibility and ROI\nDespite the proliferation of employee-centric benefits, a prevalent issue persists where benefits packages are filled with underutilized programs. For employers, this is an inefficient use of capital; for employees, it\u2019s a missed opportunity. In this webinar, Forma, a leader in the flexible benefit space and Lifestyle Spending Account (LSA) domain, will explore what an LSA is, how these customizable spending accounts support employees' individual needs, the state of the benefits market, and why the option has proven to be a solution that checks many essential boxes (i.e., cost efficiency, savings, personalization, productivity). You will leave with actionable insights from Forma\u2019s 2023 LSA benchmark report -- with data collected from more than 200 companies and 450,000 employees worldwide -- so you can design best-in-class LSAs that employees will love.\u00a0\nRegister now\n.\nLIVE EVENT\n \nFebruary 6: Houston, TX -\u00a0Building a Culture for Workers and Companies to Thrive in Times of Change\nIn an era of digital transformation and rising employee expectations, companies will need to become even more attuned to the needs and aspirations of workers to keep them engaged and satisfied on their career paths.

Among mental-health disorders, these illnesses have the second-highest mortality rate. Yet traditional care, including hospitalization and outpatient programs, can be difficult to access, distant, and costly. A better way has emerged. In this webinar, you'll hear how Accolade, a personalized healthcare platform, works with Equip, a 100% virtual, family-based treatment program that\u2019s built into daily schedules, so people can recover right at home. You'll learn from experts how this evidence-based treatment model can help people without uprooting their lives, while building support in the real world and working toward lasting recovery.\u00a0\nRegister now\n.\nWEBINAR\n \nFebruary 13:\u00a0Using Structured Hiring to Make the Process Smoother and Quicker at Every Stage\nFor both employers and candidates, the hiring process can break down and sow frustration. But there's a better way. With a thoughtful structure and sequencing, employers can find and bring talent onboard much more efficiently and with greater transparency. The improvements can be in planning (better communication between hiring managers and recruiters), sourcing (gathering the right talent to your pipeline), interviewing (shortening the lag time between stages), and onboarding (meeting the needs of new hires faster). AI and automation can reduce manual work for recruiters, as well as helping enterprise companies to hire at scale. Please join us for a fireside chat with Jon Stross, president of the hiring software platform Greenhouse, who will show how structured hiring can improve the process from beginning to end.\u00a0\nRegister now\n.\nVIRTUAL CONFERENCE\n \nFebruary 14:\u00a0Getting to the Next Stage of Diversity and Belonging\nAt a time of resistance and corporate austerity, DEI advocates will need to re-energize themselves and their organizations with new ideas, programs, and reasoning for the cause of diversity. What can DEI practitioners learn from companies with consistent success? How are companies changing their policies to respond to court rulings and lawsuits? What practices have brought the most progress in bringing diversity to leadership ranks?\u00a0\nRegister now\n.\nLIVE EVENT\n \nFebruary 20: Seattle, WA -\u00a0Building a Culture for Workers and Companies to Thrive in Times of Change\nIn an era of digital transformation and rising employee expectations, companies will need to become even more attuned to the needs and aspirations of workers to keep them engaged and satisfied on their career paths.

Before I start, I want to thank each of you for not only being amazing Calendly customers, but also the kind suggestions you\u2019ve shared over the past year. It\u2019s \nmessages like these\n that inspire us!\nUpdated Design\nWe\u2019ve always believed a \nclean, simple-to-use design\n sets many scheduling tools apart. However, we can always learn more about \u201cuser experience\u201d by listening to you all.\nAfter dozens of customer interviews, we launched a refreshed Calendly with a convenient sidebar for navigation, more intuitive Event Type editing, and better Availability settings \u2014 while still offering the powerful scheduling capabilities you depend on.\nSpeaking of \nEvent Types\n, long-time users know this is our system for allowing you to make available different blocks of times for your invitees: 30-minute Video Call, 15-Minute Quick Phone Call, 45-Minute In-Person Meeting. (Multiple event types require an \nupgrade to a paid subscription plan\n.) \nEvent Types got even better this year with some updates including the ability to \ncustomize your settings before you share your link\n. Now, there\u2019s less need to create a whole new event type to update settings (e.g., duration, location) for a quick, one-off change. \nTry Out the New UI\nNew Availability Setting: Global Holidays\n\u201cJust in time for the holi\u2026\u201d We have customers all over the world, so I try to be careful and not assume it\u2019s the holiday season for you! But, if you do observe holidays, you\u2019ll really love our \nnew holidays settings\n \u2014 all year long.\nOur default Holidays feature automatically blocks event types on country-specific holidays, providing an easy way to respect cultural and personal commitments. Go to your Availability settings (bottom left-hand section of the navigation), and you\u2019ll now find a new Holidays tab to get started.\nWhile you\u2019re in your \nAvailability settings\n, ensure you still like your \u201cdefault hours\u201d \u2014 or even think about adding another schedule. For example, my default hours for meetings are 9:00 to 5:00 Monday through Friday, but I have a special vacation schedule I can turn on to allow for a meeting on Thursdays. \nTry Holidays\nImproved Collective and Round Robin Event Types\nI love collaborative scheduling, so this is one of my favorite updates of the year!\nHundreds of teams use our \ncollaborative scheduling features\n to schedule better together as coworkers: \nDistribute meeting opportunities with available teammates such as sales or customer-success professionals (\nRound Robin\n feature)\nTeam up with a coworker (hiring manager plus recruiter) to encourage a job candidate to join your company (\nCollective\n feature)\nBut you all wanted more \u2014 and we\u2019re giving it to you: \nCollective \nplus\n Round Robin\n.\nAvailable on the \nTeams and Enterprise subscription plans\n, you can now mix and match Collective and Round Robin capabilities to easily get a combination of teammates scheduled. For example, you can improve: \nProduct demos to prospects\n: Set up an event type with an account executive plus one of five rotating sales engineers\nPanel interviews\n: Pair a hiring manager with one of three rotating team leaders plus one of four rotating peers interviewers\nNew-customer onboarding calls\n: Include a sales manager who closed the deal plus their assigned customer success manager and one of four rotating technical implementation specialists\nTry Collective and Round Robin\nRouting Improvements\nHave you always wanted to \nadd scheduling to your website\n like so many companies did in 2023, yet you\u2019ve yearned for more control over who could book a meeting? And once the customer or recruit booked a meeting, you wished it would route to the right teammate?\nThat\u2019s where \nRouting\n comes in: Now, you can qualify people by asking questions before they book a time, and then route them to the correct person on your team.\nOur marketing and sales customers inspired us to improve Routing by building integrations with their existing tools: \nIntegrate Calendly Routing with your \nHubSpot\n, \nMarketo\n, or \nPardot\n third-party forms (available on our \nTeams plan\n)\nUse our own \nRouting forms\n (\nTeams plan\n) \u2013 if you don\u2019t have a third-party form\nConduct Salesforce CRM lookup\n and account matching (\nEnterprise plan\n)\nExamine \nRouting Analytics\n to track meeting conversion rates and see how forms perform\nSync data back to your marketing-automation system such as Marketo\n to power retargeting campaigns (e.g., if someone fills out a form, but doesn\u2019t book a meeting, trigger an email) (\nTeams plan\n)\nGet Routing\nAnalytics Improvements\nWe aimed our first introduction of \nAnalytics\n at account administrators seeking to understand scheduling trends \u2014 across their team. Now, each person on your team can view their own meeting data in their \npersonal Analytics Dashboard\n. \nAvailable on the \nStandard subscription plan\n, your personal Analytics Dashboard allows you to fine-tune scheduling with \ninsights\n like popular meeting times, top event types, total completed events, and more. \nLearn More\nAccount-Admin Tool Updates\nHave you thanked your account administrator lately? As our thank-you, we\u2019ve recently released a bevy of updates to make their lives easier: \nAdmin Dashboard\n: See organization-wide activity \u2014 pending invites, missing calendar and video conferencing connections, and key event stats \u2014 in one central location. (Available on the \nStandard subscription plan\n)\nUser Profiles\n: Review teammate-specific details, such as their calendar and video integrations, availability, and quick links to their event types, by clicking on a user\u2019s avatar. (\nStandard plan\n)\nGroup Admin Improvements\n: Group Admins can now invite teammates, create Managed Events, and view meeting data in the Analytics Dashboard for their Calendly Groups. (\nTeams plan\n)\nTop Webinars From 2023\nThousands of you attended our webinars this year for \ngetting started\n, using \nCalendly as a team\n, and learning more about best practices in your role. These were our most popular webinars in 2023:\nSales & Marketing teams: \nHow to Fill Pipeline During Economic Uncertainty\n \nCustomer Success and Support teams: \nBuild a Better Journey for Retention: Pro Tips for CS Teams\nRecruiting teams: \nHire Faster with Calendly: Pro Tips for Recruiters\nEducation teams: \nHow Dartmouth Supports Student Wellbeing with Calendly\nFinancial Services teams: \nHow Financial Services Companies Drive Revenue with Calendly\n \nCRM Improvements\nSalesforce\n: One of our most popular integrations is with Salesforce, as it allows sales teams to sync meeting data into this popular CRM. We improved the integration this year by allowing admins to now \nsync data to Salesforce by groups\n (e.g., a Sales Group), sync profile links and Calendly Managed Event links to Salesforce, and sync no-show status to the CRM. (Available on our \nEnterprise plan\n)\nDynamics\n: Our Microsoft-loving customers spoke up and asked for an integration with Microsoft\u2019s CRM: Dynamics. And of course we had to deliver. With our Microsoft Dynamics 365 integration, when Calendly meetings are scheduled, your invitee information and scheduled meeting information is automatically added (or updated) in your records. (Available on our \nEnterprise plan\n) \nOther Popular Integrations\nLinktree\n: Easily add your Calendly to this service used by millions of social influencers and more.\nGong\n: Gong released its outbound-sales engagement platform this year, and chose Calendly as a scheduling integration.\nZapier\n: Don\u2019t see an integration you like? Zapier has probably made it possible for you. \nView Integrations\nDomain Control\nIn 2023, we launched \nDomain Control\n for account admins and IT departments looking to guide employees signing up for Calendly to join their primary accounts, where team scheduling features and account-wide integrations (e.g., Managed Events, Salesforce, etc.) are set up and ready to go. \nLearn More\nUpdated \nBrowser Extensions\n and \nMobile Apps\nJoin me and many others, and make it easier to use Calendly wherever you are with our \nmobile apps\n and \nbrowser extensions\n.\nOur tools are now better at group collaboration with shared event type avatars and meeting polls, faster at serving up exactly what you\u2019re looking for with event type search, more flexible with one-off meetings, and more embedded in your other tools from Google Calendar to Gong. \nCalendly Access Update\nDo you allowlist Calendly IPs? If so, you\u2019ll want to read more about an \nupcoming change.\n \nAdditional Popular Resources\nReport: \nTotal Economic Impact of Calendly by Forrester Research\n \nReport: \nState of Scheduling Report\n \nCustomer Stories\nOh my, there was so much to write about this year!

    "body": "Level-up your training in 2024!\nView this email in your browser\n.\n \nLEARN HOW TO\nHONE YOUR L&D\nCOMPETENCIES\nCOMPETENCY MODEL GUIDE\nTRAINING INDUSTRY COURSES\n \nWhat Is the Training Manager Competency Model?\nCompetency models represent the skills and abilities necessary to be successful in a given role. Based on the seven core training manager responsibilities identified by Training Industry research, the \nTraining Manager Competency Model\u2122\n includes all the competencies training professionals need to lead high-performing training functions. So, how can you use the model to level-up your training in 2024?\n1. Identify Your Competency Gaps\nWe've created the \nTraining Manager Competency Model Assessment Tool\n to help you measure your own competencies as a training professional. Once you've completed the assessment, you'll get access to a benchmarking report sharing the results from 1,000+ training professionals to see how you compare.\n2. Assess Your Training Team\nIf you're leading or contributing to a learning and development team, you can use the competency model to align your team. Through the assessment, you'll be able to identify your team's strengths and opportunities for improvement! After completing the\u00a0\ntraining team competency assessment\n, you'll\u00a0have the option to access a custom competency report detailing the results and discuss your competency gaps with one of our directors of professional development to help you create a custom team development plan based on your results.\n3. Make a 2024 Development Plan\nMake a plan that you can stick to, targeting your most critical competency gaps. You can use\n this template\n to create specific, measurable, achievable, relevant and time-bound (SMART) goals that align to the seven core training management responsibilities outlined in the \nTraining Manager Competency Model\u2122\n.\n4. Consider Training Industry Courses\nIf you're looking for ways to address your competency gaps, \nTraining Industry Courses\n are here to help.

    "body": "You don't often get email from fortune@msg.fortune.com. \nLearn why this is important\nDiscover the Fortune CEO Weekly Europe newsletter with this special preview.\n \nView this email in your browser.\n\u200a\nWelcome to a special preview edition of Fortune CEO Weekly Europe, a new newsletter about the executives, companies, and issues shaping every facet of business in Europe, written by executive editor Peter Vanham.\n\u00a0\nIf you would like to receive Fortune CEO Weekly Europe in your inbox, you can subscribe \nhere\n.\n\u200a\nEU's climate-minded proposals are clashing with energy giants' renewed love of fossil fuels\nI spent much of last week in the UAE, where the United Nations COP climate meeting is now in full swing. And one of the most striking observations I made while there was the diverging nature of Europe's two climate narratives.\n\u00a0\nOn the government side, the European Union was among those making the most climate-minded proposals. The EU\n \nspearheaded an effort\n\u00a0\nto set a global goal of tripling renewable energy by 2030. It also called for \u201cconcrete actions to\n\u00a0\nphase out fossil fuels\n\u00a0\nthroughout energy systems globally,\u201d and said it would be \u201cpushing for language that reflects this in the final COP decision.\u201d\n \n\u00a0\nBased on that strong advocacy, you would never guess that almost all of Europe\u2019s largest companies in the past year made U-turns in these exact areas.\n\u00a0\nRather than phasing out fossil fuels, Shell, for example, said that its production of oil and gas will remain stable until 2030, and that it will invest three to four times more in oil and gas until 2035 than in \u201clow-carbon products,\u201d\n\u00a0\nEuronews\n reported\n. \nSimilarly, TotalEnergies spent more than three times on oil and gas what it spent on renewables this past year, the\n\u00a0\nFinancial Times\n wrote\n\u00a0\nin May. BP, too, made a \u201cpivot back to oil,\u201d\n\u00a0\nReuters reported\n\u00a0\nin February.\u00a0\n \n\u00a0\nThese deviations from the EU's course of action matter because Shell, TotalEnergies, and BP are not just Europe\u2019s largest energy companies, but are among the continent\u2019s largest companies \ntout court\n. On \nFortune\n\u2019s\n\u00a0\ninaugural Fortune 500 Europe\n\u00a0\nlist of largest companies by revenue, they came in at Nos. 1, 4, and 6, respectively.\n \n\u00a0\nThis situation is problematic because the following two things cannot be true at the same time: that Europe pursues a policy of rapid decarbonization, betting that this creates prosperity for its people, \nand\n that its largest companies continue investing in fossil fuels for the sake of their stakeholders.\n \n\u00a0\nIf the former statement is correct, Shell, BP and Total will cease being Europe\u2019s largest firms sometime in the next decade because they lack renewable investments. If it is the latter, European policymakers will have wasted a lot of money on renewable technologies that won\u2019t drive its economy forward for at least another decade.\u00a0\n\u00a0\nSuch disjunction almost makes one wistful for the bygone era of state-owned energy companies. In Europe, not all state-owned energy companies are a thing of the past. Germany\u2019s Uniper (No. 3) and France\u2019s aptly named \u201cElectricite de France\u201d (No. 10) are state-owned (though Uniper only temporarily). They also stand out as having climate goals that reflect the EU's.\n\u00a0\nIs that the secret to energy alignment, then? Should Europe revert to exerting greater control over its energy companies to force through its energy agenda? Should its energy companies take more cues from policymakers, rather than their shareholders? Or should each just carry on doing what they think is right?\n\u00a0\nWherever you stand on this issue, it's clear everyone needs to be on the same page soon. Energy supply is Europe\u2019s No. 1 economic concern, and energy companies are more vital to its economy than those in the U.S. It\u2019s a catch-22 that doesn\u2019t bode well for Europe\u2019s future competitiveness.\u00a0\n\u00a0\nPeter Vanham\n\u200a\nWant to read more Fortune CEO Weekly Europe?\nSign up to receive the newsletter in your inbox every Wednesday.\nSubscribe to Fortune \nCEO Weekly Europe\n \n\u200a\nThis email was sent to m.neu@lcwmail.com\u00a0\nUnsubscribe\n | \nManage subscriptions\nFortune Media (USA) Corporation\n40 Fulton Street New York, NY 10038",

    "body": "Hi Melissa, \n\u00a0\nHow are you? I hope you had a lovely Thanksgiving, that your teaching and other things on your plate are going well, and that you\u2019re having a good holiday season so far!\n\u00a0\nRe your email below\u2026.\n\u00a0\nUnderstood re: prospect contacts and the lists they came from. \u00a0I still don\u2019t have a firm understanding on what each list represents but your categorization of what kinds of leads/prospects you pursued based on subject matter expertise, as well as based on specific messaging in emails or marketing, is helpful. \u00a0Plus you\u2019ve mentioned to me in the past that anything labeled \u2018warm leads\u2019 were leads that came in through the LCW website. \n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\nThanks for the directions re: the Teams lists and the location of the source files in your SIDE PROJECTS folder. I moved that to SALES/sales ops/hubspot, for posterity. \u00a0Re: the Scoro source files, I unfortunately do not have access to the \u201cMelissa Neu\u201d folder under LCW Dropbox. \n\u00a0\nThen, re: the filtering process you outlined below with the screenshots \u2013 these are contacts that were imported into HubSpot after various conferences or marketing events, right?\u00a0 These are different from the imports from your SIDE PROJECT folder? Some filenames in this dropdown are self explanatory (e.g., \u201cFDO-2022\u201d), but some, like \u2018people export\u2019 or \u2018mailchimp set up import\u2019 \u2013 I\u2019m not sure what those are. \n\u00a0\nFinally and separately, on Nov 15 you emailed that by Monday Nov 20 you were going to share with me \u201can updated playbook with the HubSpot Instructions that you requested, have sent you a follow-up email to our last meeting with a few sources and clarifications \n(RP: that\u2019s what this email was, I assume?)\n, have the finalized consulting report view to you, and completed the final changes to the quote and proposal templates.\u201d\u00a0 Did I miss that? I haven\u2019t seen it and I wanted to check. \u00a0\n\u00a0\nThank you!!\nRP\n\u00a0\nRebecca M. Parrilla\n(she/her)\nHead of Client Solutions\nLCW\n\u00a0\nFrom:\n Melissa Neu <m.neu@lcwmail.com> \nSent:\n Tuesday, November 28, 2023 2:57 PM\nTo:\n Rebecca Parrilla <r.parrilla@lcwmail.com>\nCc:\n Pedro Seminario <P.seminario@lcwmail.com>\nSubject:\n HubSpot List Import Follow-up\n\u00a0\nDear Rebecca,\n\u00a0\nThinking about our most recent conversation, I wanted to clarify a few things about HubSpot and the lists we uploaded into the system. One of HubSpot's great tools is the ability to assign leads, contacts, and companies to sales reps. For our purposes, the list that the contact came from was less important than knowing who it was assigned to and what the BD associate's expectations were when working with that lead. Often, Hannah and Pedro never saw the source file, but I would alert them when an upload was complete.\n\u00a0\nNow that your team has fewer and different people, it is hard to see that different contacts were assigned to different folks for different reasons. Our team would meet on average three times a week to coordinate. Unless it impacted messaging, it wasn't always necessary for us to know which of the lists the prospective client came from. Similarly, each member of our team had a different focus. In other words, Pedro would be focused on promoting translations and eLearning, Hannah would focus on facilitations, and I would concentrate on finding enterprise-wide clients (multi-modal learning opportunities) and consulting opportunities. The team was focused on this because we had varying subject matter knowledge and tenure at LCW. It also worked on the team's strengths \u2013 Pedro has extensive translation experience (for example) and eLearning. \n\u00a0\nAs I mentioned, the lists were only relevant as they pertained to specific messaging in emails or marketing. For example, the Forum attendees were on a list because we campaigned pre- and post-event. In contrast, we always invited folks from our assigned warm leads list to the events or promotions because folks on this list had submitted a website inquiry to LCW in the past three years. That doesn't mean that the Forum folks didn't get other communication, but in this example, we needed to differentiate that group based on messaging. \n\u00a0\nTo this end, while the three of us haven't talked much about the website integration or marketing side of HubSpot, one of the critical features we took advantage of was how leads were routed from the web. As outlined above, we would get leads assigned to us based on the client's indicated need or area of interest.\n\u00a0\nTaking advantage of HubSpot's capacity for sequencing, we didn't often need to refer to lists once the imports happened. Nevertheless, I completely understand your needs. Ultimately, this long-winded email is meant to share the following:\n\u00a0\nWhat you found in Teams was a snapshot of working documents pre-HubSpot implementation. However, I was diligent in keeping source files for all the uploads. The source files are kept here: LCW Dropbox\\SIDE PROJECTS\\MELISSA\\CRM\\HubSpot\nPlease note there are iterations here, and the documents are explicitly formatted for upload.\nSome lists were cleaned and uploaded into Scoro first (such as the warm leads list.) By cleaning, we worked with the associate consultants and the intern to update all contact details, remove contacts that don't work at their job any longer, and either identify that person's replacement or find contact details for them in their new role (or both). If you ever want to look at those source files, you can find the Scoro uploads here: LCW Dropbox\\Melissa Neu\\Melissa's DropBox\\ME\\CRM.\nBesides the lists we used in HubSpot for specific campaigns, you can always pull a list based on a previously uploaded file through filters. Here are the steps:\nFrom the Contacts view, go to advanced filters: \n\u00a0\nClick on advanced filters and then click on add filters:\n\u00a0\nAfter you click on add filters, you will be given a list of options to filter by. You will want to select \"Import.\"\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\nAfter selecting import, you will be given a list of options, and you can choose to select any list by name. You can also choose more than one list at a time. \nAs soon as you click your list, the filter starts. Once filtered, you can assign these to someone, put them in a campaign, share them in a view, and/or put them into a list.\n\u00a0\nYou will notice that some lists were marketing lists; those source files are kept here: \\LCW Dropbox\\MARKETING\\HubSpot\\Set-up. Please note that some of these contacts are captured in other lists.

We have gone through the Discovery Phase and now would like to establish shared vocabulary, frameworks, and skills of DEIB concepts to create consistent and broad DEIB fluency.\n\u00a0\nWe are currently seeking a partner to deliver unconscious bias training. As a global organization with 3,000 employees, we are looking for a scalable training solution that will cater to Individual Contributors, People Managers, and Senior Leaders. The training should be available in English, French, Chinese, Japanese, Malay, and Spanish, and should be compatible with our LMS, Cornerstone.\n\u00a0\nOur hourly workforce is 1\u2019500 employees, salary workforce consists of about 1,600 employees, including 420 people managers globally. Our senior leadership team is composed of 12 Executive Leaders and 80 Senior Global Leaders.\n\u00a0\nWe aim to select a partner ideally by the end of this year and implement the training starting March/April 2024.\n\u00a0\nIs this something LCW can assist us with?\n\u00a0\nI am looking forward to hearing from you\n\u00a0\nBest regards,\nAnna\n\u00a0\nAnna Drozdz\nTel: 00.41.79.579.66.13\nDirector, Global Talent Management\nwww.haemonetics.com\nFrom:\n Sarah Nodarse <s.nodarse@lcwmail.com> \nSent:\n 27 April 2023 21:22\nTo:\n Helen Fatseas <hfatseas@haemonetics.com>; Melissa Neu <m.neu@lcwmail.com>\nCc:\n Anna Drozdz <anna.drozdz@haemonetics.com>\nSubject:\n RE: Following Up Re: DEIB Engagement\n\u00a0\nEXTERNAL:\n \nThis email originated from outside of Haemonetics.

Yet, you know what holds some others back? They worry just anyone will find their Calendly, and book a time without qualifying them! That\u2019s what I love about our \nRouting features\n, as they allow you to ask invitees questions before they can book time with you and your team. \nAvailable on the Teams subscription plan and above, \nRouting\n is now improved with Routing Analytics that reveal how your routing forms perform with candidates, clients, and potential customers. Within your \nCalendly Analytics\n, you can now see reports on conversion rates and track scheduling trends coming from your Calendly, HubSpot, Marketo, or Pardot forms. Note: Only account admins and owners can \ncheck out routing analytics\n. \nGet Routing Analytics\nSurvey: How Do You Organize \nYour Professional Contacts?\nGetting more organized is often a priority as we start a new year. When it comes to managing your professional contacts (candidates, clients, and customer leads), we\u2019d love to learn more about how you currently keep track of these relationships. Let us know by taking this \n3-minute survey\n! \nTake the Survey\nWhat Forrester Research Found \nWhen They Studied Calendly\nIf you haven\u2019t checked out \nForrester Research\u2019s study on Calendly\n \u2014 which includes interviews with customers DocuSign, Atlassian, GardaWorld, and Semrush \u2014 you can grab it \nhere\n.\nPersonally, I\u2019ve always enjoyed talking to research analyst firms like Forrester, because they work with thousands of customers who want advice on which tech products to buy. And, as a Calendly employee, they can give me a \u201cvoice of the customer\u201d reality check when I need one! Here are a few things Forrester heard from Calendly\u2019s customers:\n\u201cOne of the pain points was trying to schedule with external clients while keeping their data safely secured. Calendly really supports their existing workflows. I don\u2019t think we have any other tools that do that level of advanced extra routing for a team.\u201d - Atlassian\u2019s Global Collaboration Specialist\n\u201cFirst [added value is] connectivity, [then] ease of access to our calendar so that there was a way that team members could manage their tasks. Another added value is consistency, as we\u2019re delivering our engagement consistently to optimize customer and employee experience along with ease and flexibility.\u201d DocuSign\u2019s VP of Success at Scale\n\u201cWe can definitely say that when a sales rep is involved and has a meeting on the calendar for a renewal, the chances of expansion go up and Calendly definitely plays a part in that.\u201d - Semrush\u2019s Sales Project Manager\n\u201cA couple of years ago, we were at 21 days [in our recruiting process], and then we got it down to 17 days. [Now it is] about 15 and a half days from application to when they\u2019re earning a paycheck.\u201d - GardaWorld\u2019s Senior Director of Talent Acquisition\nThat\u2019s just a sample of what these customers have to say in the report. \nFeel free to download it\n, or read the \nblog post\n if you prefer. \nGet the Report\nAn Even Edgier Extension\nHave you added our \nbrowser extensions\n yet to make your life easier? Join customer Trevor Robinson and thousands of others who use it to quickly grab their scheduling link in their email tool, use our LinkedIn integration, and more!\nAnd, Microsoft Edge users, Calendly\u2019s extension is easier to find than ever before \u2014 no more detours to the Chrome Web Store. Find us with all your other \nEdge Add-ons here\n. If you haven\u2019t had the chance to try our extension yet, it grants you one-click access to Calendly from anywhere on the web, or even from the \nOutlook\n app if that\u2019s where you spend most of your day.\nWe\u2019re also available on \nChrome\n and \nFirefox\n, but if there\u2019s a different browser or application you\u2019d like to see us tackle next, \nreply\n to let us know. \nGet the Edge Extension\nSalesforce Integration Update\nIf you take advantage of the \nno-show status feature\n in Calendly to track meeting attendees, those updates can now sync to Salesforce automatically. This feature requires the \nlatest version of the Salesforce integration package (2.6)\n and manual enablement of the no-show flow template in Salesforce. \nLearn More\nAdditional Resources\nWebinar: \nHow to Use Calendly to Close More Deals\n \nReport: \nTotal Economic Impact of Calendly by Forrester Research\n \nWebinar: \nGetting Started with Calendly\n \nWebinar: \nHow Teams Use Calendly\n \nThanks for reading,\u00a0\nJeff Hardison\nHead of Product Marketing\u00a0@ Calendly\nNeed help?\n \u00a0\nHelp Center\n \u200c | \u200c \nPricing & FAQs\n \u200c | \u200c \nContact Us\n\u00a0\nMore than a scheduling link.\n \n \n \n \n \n115 E.

    "subject": "HubSpot List Import Follow-up",
    "body": "Dear Rebecca,\n\u00a0\nThinking about our most recent conversation, I wanted to clarify a few things about HubSpot and the lists we uploaded into the system. One of HubSpot's great tools is the ability to assign leads, contacts, and companies to sales reps. For our purposes, the list that the contact came from was less important than knowing who it was assigned to and what the BD associate's expectations were when working with that lead. Often, Hannah and Pedro never saw the source file, but I would alert them when an upload was complete.\n\u00a0\nNow that your team has fewer and different people, it is hard to see that different contacts were assigned to different folks for different reasons. Our team would meet on average three times a week to coordinate. Unless it impacted messaging, it wasn't always necessary for us to know which of the lists the prospective client came from. Similarly, each member of our team had a different focus. In other words, Pedro would be focused on promoting translations and eLearning, Hannah would focus on facilitations, and I would concentrate on finding enterprise-wide clients (multi-modal learning opportunities) and consulting opportunities. The team was focused on this because we had varying subject matter knowledge and tenure at LCW. It also worked on the team's strengths \u2013 Pedro has extensive translation experience (for example) and eLearning. \n\u00a0\nAs I mentioned, the lists were only relevant as they pertained to specific messaging in emails or marketing. For example, the Forum attendees were on a list because we campaigned pre- and post-event. In contrast, we always invited folks from our assigned warm leads list to the events or promotions because folks on this list had submitted a website inquiry to LCW in the past three years. That doesn't mean that the Forum folks didn't get other communication, but in this example, we needed to differentiate that group based on messaging. \n\u00a0\nTo this end, while the three of us haven't talked much about the website integration or marketing side of HubSpot, one of the critical features we took advantage of was how leads were routed from the web. As outlined above, we would get leads assigned to us based on the client's indicated need or area of interest.\n\u00a0\nTaking advantage of HubSpot's capacity for sequencing, we didn't often need to refer to lists once the imports happened. Nevertheless, I completely understand your needs. Ultimately, this long-winded email is meant to share the following:\n\u00a0\nWhat you found in Teams was a snapshot of working documents pre-HubSpot implementation. However, I was diligent in keeping source files for all the uploads. The source files are kept here: LCW Dropbox\\SIDE PROJECTS\\MELISSA\\CRM\\HubSpot\nPlease note there are iterations here, and the documents are explicitly formatted for upload.\nSome lists were cleaned and uploaded into Scoro first (such as the warm leads list.) By cleaning, we worked with the associate consultants and the intern to update all contact details, remove contacts that don't work at their job any longer, and either identify that person's replacement or find contact details for them in their new role (or both). If you ever want to look at those source files, you can find the Scoro uploads here: LCW Dropbox\\Melissa Neu\\Melissa's DropBox\\ME\\CRM.\nBesides the lists we used in HubSpot for specific campaigns, you can always pull a list based on a previously uploaded file through filters. Here are the steps:\nFrom the Contacts view, go to advanced filters: \n\u00a0\nClick on advanced filters and then click on add filters:\n\u00a0\nAfter you click on add filters, you will be given a list of options to filter by. You will want to select \"Import.\"\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\nAfter selecting import, you will be given a list of options, and you can choose to select any list by name. You can also choose more than one list at a time. \nAs soon as you click your list, the filter starts. Once filtered, you can assign these to someone, put them in a campaign, share them in a view, and/or put them into a list.\n\u00a0\nYou will notice that some lists were marketing lists; those source files are kept here: \\LCW Dropbox\\MARKETING\\HubSpot\\Set-up. Please note that some of these contacts are captured in other lists. These uploads, at times, were only changing settings to ensure that folks subscribed to the mailing list were tagged in HubSpot.\n\u00a0\nI hope that this information provides more clarity as to where the source files are and how the system operates. Let me know if you have any questions or need me to walk you through this information.\n\u00a0\nKind regards,\n\u00a0\nMelissa\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\nC.

The halo of German cars and machines, Italian and French luxury goods, and the continent\u2019s financial prowess did the rest.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\n\u00a0\nBut today, Europe\u2019s businesses are under stresses they haven\u2019t experienced in at least 40 years.

Most companies are not ready. The new \"Intelligence Age\" is a time when skills, employee creativity, information and AI will define our companies.\nIn\u00a0tomorrow's webinar, we'll explore three strategies for success: rethinking the organization as dynamic rather than static, rethinking management with human-centered leadership, and rethinking HR as no longer an expense center, but rather a function like R&D that must build and invest in the company's people. All told, this means we need to redesign our companies around the person and shift to a new model for work. The time to act is now.\nJoin us tomorrow",

    "body": "Plus: Meet the women ditching the corporate rat race to become \"Snail Girls\" with \"lazy girl jobs.\"\nView this email in your browser.\n\u00a0\nSaturday, November 18, 2023\nLee Clifford\nFinance Editor\nThe U.S. is on the cusp of switching from a decade of plenty to a long and painful period of austerity.\nSo writes \nFortune\n senior correspondent Shawn Tully \nin a new piece\n examining the forces that may exert control of the markets and economy heading into 2024. Speaking with Jim Masturzo, chief investment officer at Research Affiliates, a firm that oversees strategies for over $130 billion in mutual funds and ETFs for the likes of Pimco and Charles Schwab, Tully writes about how the year could play out: \n\u201cMasturzo concedes that in the short term, \u2018The economy could remain buoyant and investors resilient.\u2019 But he believes that the big federal spending and \u2018free money\u2019 Fed policy that funded the bash will soon leave a stiff hangover. \u2018The macro game of musical chairs cannot go on forever,\u2019 Masturzo writes. It was the regional banking crisis starting in March, he says, that exposed the first cracks. But after a steep selloff, frenzied excitement over the future of AI sent Big Tech soaring once again.\u201d \n\u201cNow, Masturzo believes the economy and the markets stand near an historic inflection point that can only temporarily be averted by such probably ephemeral phenomena as the AI craze and the favorable Nov. 14 CPI report that got shares jumping. The exhaustion of the COVID money, the end of student loan forbearance, and the stubbornly rising prices bound to spook consumers will \u2018pave the way for an eventual recession,\u2019 and usher in years of austerity.\u201d\nThis will have profound effects on the markets, too. As Tully writes: \u201cIn the new paradigm, the best investment categories of the last decade should prove the worst performers going forward, while the beaten-down, unloved sectors of recent years are likely to thrive.\u201d\nYou can read the full analysis\u2014including which stocks are likely to thrive in the new era of austerity\u2014\nhere\n.\nExpect subpar returns in a new \u2018age of austerity,\u2019 says a top analyst at Research Affiliates\nNov. 16, 2023\n\u200a\nAI\nHow OpenAI's Mira Murati is building ChatGPT and shaping your future\nMurati was named OpenAI's interim CEO Friday after Sam Altman was ousted by the board.\nFINANCE\nHow low interest rates reshaped the J-Curve\nPrivate funds minted in 2018 handed cash to LPs faster.\nHOUSING\nThis chart shows why millennials, the biggest generation in American history, will keep housing prices sky-high for years to come\nThe largest generation in American history is entering prime home-buying age against a chronic shortage of housing supply.\nLower inflation may be the hammer that cracks the unaffordable housing market for would-be homebuyers\u00a0\nHome shoppers may benefit from stabilizing consumer prices and cheaper mortgages if the Fed cuts interest rates.\nSUCCESS\nMeet the women ditching the corporate rat race to become \u2018Snail Girls\u2019 with \u2018lazy girl jobs\u2019\n\"I live like I'm retired, which is what everyone is working so hard to do anyway, right?\"\nEmployers are cutting white-collar benefits as they face higher costs\u2014but they\u2019ll do anything to keep working parents on the job, survey shows\nMobile phone discounts are out.

Here are the costs before and after the discount (discounts apply when you make the full payment up front, and you may schedule the sessions at times convenient for you): \n\u00a0 \n\u00a0 \nSpotlight on\u2026\n \nSuggested Delivery Month in 2024\n \nPer individual workshop\n \nPer workshop when purchased in bundle (-20%)\n \n1 \nBlack/African American Community \nFebruary (Black History Month) \n$3,000 \n$2400 \n2 \nWomen in Leadership\u00a0 \nMarch (Women\u2019s History Month) \n\u00a0 \n$3,000 \n$2400 \n3 \nBeing an Ally for the Asian American Community\u00a0 \nMay (AAPI Heritage Month) \n$4,500 \n(2 facilitators) \n$3600 \n4 \nThe LGBTQ+ Community\u00a0 \nJune (LGBTQ+ Pride Month) \n$3,000 \n$2400 \n5 \nPersons with Disabilities\u00a0 \nJuly (Disability Pride Month) \n$3,000 \n$2400 \n6 \nThe Hispanic/Latinx/e Community\u00a0 \nSeptember (Hispanic Heritage Month) \n$3,000 \n$2400 \n7 \nIndigenous People in North America\u00a0 \nOctober (Indigenous Peoples\u2019 Day) or November (Native American Heritage Month) \n$4,500 \n(2 facilitators) \n$3600 \n8 \nU.S. Veterans\u00a0Community \nNovember (Veterans\u2019 Day) \n$3,000 \n$2400 \n9 \nU.S. Generations \nDecember (Or April or August) \n$3,000 \n$2400 \n\u00a0 \n\u00a0 \nTOTAL \n$30K \n$24K \n\u00a0 \nSeparately, we are all very aware that our field of DEI has been experiencing a lot of backlash in 2023, and that many of us have had to adapt by using more varied language during our work of advancing diversity, equity, and inclusion \u2013 so that we can reach all of our important constituents. \u00a0We\u2019ve compiled this list, in case it\u2019s useful to you at all: \n\u00a0 \nWords to use instead of \"DEI\", when embedding inclusion & equity within our organization: \nInclusive leadership \nLeading across cultures \nOrganizational culture \nBalanced teams \nBuilding intercultural competence as a leadership, communication, and collaboration skill \nAccessibility (for persons with disabilities but also equitable accessibility to information, resources, key people & networks, and development opportunities) \nFairness \nRespect \nPsychological safety \nUnity \n\u00a0 \nOutcomes of our work: \nHigher team performance, higher-performing teams \nMore effective communication and listening skills \nOptimized potential and contributions of the people on our teams \nBeing able to appreciate people for who they are and the value they bring \nMinimizing the chances that we\u2019ll miss people\u2019s value & contributions \nUnderstanding colleagues and customers more deeply and authentically \nEffective collaboration \nLeveraging team members\u2019 strengths much more effectively \nMaking (big or small) adjustments to your practices and process to improve fairness and objectivity \nImprovement of team dynamics \nImprovement of people\u2019s ability to understand what their direct reports or colleagues need \nAn environment where everyone can succeed \nCohesive team culture \n\u00a0 \nLastly, if you feel our spotlight bundle is something that would resonate with your teams, I would love the opportunity to connect and set a time for us to meet. \n\u00a0 \nThank you for your partnership and for your focus, and I look forward to your response.

    "body": "Thanks so much, Melissa. Looking forward to the rest of the stuff on Monday!\n\u00a0\nCopying Briza on the reply, as she\u2019s helping Chuck with a bunch of projects, tracking info on contractors being one of them, plus she\u2019s been helping us with the HubSpot changes. And also copying Alisa, as she is involved with HubSpot decision-making. \n\u00a0\nRe: the Marketing features, as I mentioned to you the decision was made relatively recently to perhaps downgrade the Marketing module to \u2018Starter\u2019 from the current \u2018Professional\u2019.\u00a0 Since we don\u2019t have a marketing team anymore we currently don\u2019t have a coordinated Marketing strategy, but we will at some point in the future. So for now it may be best to go down to \u2018Starter\u2019 \u2013 though I don\u2019t understand the pros and cons enough to be the decision maker. \u00a0\n\u00a0\nI also lack the Marketing expertise or knowledge to make a decision on your list below, but I did some digging and created a document comparing the \u2018Starter\u2019 module to the \u2018Professional\u2019 module (which is what we have now) from data on their website \u2013 see attached. \u00a0\n\u00a0\nLooking at the bullets you listed below, after looking a the Comparison doc:\nCampaign Tracking:\n Campaign Mgmt and Campaign Reporting are both unavailable in the Starter module. \nMarketing reporting:\n 10 dashboards and 10 reports per dashboards are included in Starter. Campaign reporting, custom reporting, and marketing asset comparison reporting are unavailable.\nBlog:\n 1 blog is included\nWebsite integration:\n Website traffic analytics (Standard web analytics dashboard) is included in Starter. In pro, we have \u2018customizable website traffic analytics\u2019. Also, I don\u2019t know what this means but \u2018Google Search Console integration\u2019 is not available in Starter. \n\u00a0\nI\u2019ve highlighted all pertinent boxes in orange in the attached. Hopefully this is useful to us, Briza and Alisa!\n\u00a0\nRebecca M.

I\u2019ve also worked with many different J&J stakeholders in the past, including Jessica Gilbert, Danny Burrell, Alejandro Tobolski, and business and HR/L&D leaders in Consumer, Janssen (including the GCSO), Medical Devices (including Vision, DePuy Synthes, and Ethicon), and Supply Chain (in Europe). \n\u00a0 \nFirst\n - \nthank you\n \nfor leveraging our DEI and cultural competence learning interventions throughout the years. \nYou are one of our most valued clients.\n \u00a0\u00a0\n \n\u00a0 \nSecond\n \u2013 I believe that Dan has already reached out to you about this, but a quick reminder that we\u2019re discounting our interactive, \u00a0identity-specific Spotlights when purchased in a bundle. These one-hour, interactive, deep-dive workshops are focused on the experience of being a member of these communities, and contribute to building cultural competence, inclusion skills, and a culture of belonging throughout the enterprise. Here are the costs before and after the discount (discounts apply when you make the full payment up front, and you may schedule the sessions at times convenient for you): \n\u00a0 \n\u00a0 \n\u00a0 \nSpotlight on\u2026\n \nSuggested Delivery Month in 2024\n \nPer individual workshop\n \nPer workshop when purchased in bundle (-20%)\n \n1 \nBlack/African American Community \nFebruary (Black History Month) \n$3,000 \n$2400 \n2 \nWomen in Leadership\u00a0 \nMarch (Women\u2019s History Month) \n\u00a0 \n$3,000 \n$2400 \n3 \nBeing an Ally for the Asian American Community\u00a0 \nMay (AAPI Heritage Month) \n$4,500 \n(2 facilitators) \n$3600 \n4 \nThe LGBTQ+ Community\u00a0 \nJune (LGBTQ+ Pride Month) \n$3,000 \n$2400 \n5 \nPersons with Disabilities\u00a0 \nJuly (Disability Pride Month) \n$3,000 \n$2400 \n6 \nThe Hispanic/Latinx/e Community\u00a0 \nSeptember (Hispanic Heritage Month) \n$3,000 \n$2400 \n7 \nIndigenous People in North America\u00a0 \nOctober (Indigenous Peoples\u2019 Day) or November (Native American Heritage Month) \n$4,500 \n(2 facilitators) \n$3600 \n8 \nU.S. Veterans\u00a0Community \nNovember (Veterans\u2019 Day) \n$3,000 \n$2400 \n9 \nU.S. Generations \nDecember (Or April or August) \n$3,000 \n$2400 \n\u00a0 \n\u00a0 \nTOTAL \n$30K \n$24K \n\u00a0 \nThird\n - we\u2019re all very aware that our field of DEI has been experiencing a lot of backlash in 2023, and that many of us have had to adapt by using more varied language during our work of advancing diversity, equity, and inclusion \u2013 so that we can reach all of our important constituents. \u00a0We\u2019ve compiled this list, in case it\u2019s useful to you at all: \n\u00a0 \nWords to use instead of \"DEI\", when embedding inclusion & equity within our organization: \nInclusive leadership \nLeading across cultures \nOrganizational culture \nBalanced teams \nBuilding intercultural competence as a leadership, communication, and collaboration skill \nAccessibility (for persons with disabilities but also equitable accessibility to information, resources, key people & networks, and development opportunities) \nFairness \nRespect \nPsychological safety \nUnity \n\u00a0 \nOutcomes of our work: \nHigher team performance, higher-performing teams \nMore effective communication and listening skills \nOptimized potential and contributions of the people on our teams \nBeing able to appreciate people for who they are and the value they bring \nMinimizing the chances that we\u2019ll miss people\u2019s value & contributions \nUnderstanding colleagues and customers more deeply and authentically \nEffective collaboration \nLeveraging team members\u2019 strengths much more effectively \nMaking (big or small) adjustments to your practices and process to improve fairness and objectivity \nImprovement of team dynamics \nImprovement of people\u2019s ability to understand what their direct reports or colleagues need \nAn environment where everyone can succeed \nCohesive team culture \n\u00a0 \n\u00a0 \nFINALLY\n - in case you\u2019re looking for additional ways to make J&J\u2019s Talent Talks/succession planning process more inclusive and equitable, we\u2019re offering a comprehensive curriculum for that, too (I know that JNJ already has the microlearning outlined in Step 3): \n\u00a0 \n \n\u00a0 \n\u00a0 \nWe understand that creating a sustainable culture of inclusion is an \nongoing process\n, where we must regularly attend to and improve upon people systems, policies, and practices as well as strengthen cultural competence mindsets and inclusive leadership skills. \n\u00a0 \nThank you for your partnership and for your focus, \nwe appreciate Johnson & Johnson very much!\n \n\u00a0 \nRebecca \n\u00a0 \n\u00a0 \n\u00a0 \nRebecca M.

Your strategy should include your objectives for the year, budgets and timelines, and any information relevant to how you came to your proposed solution(s).\nWhat Is Strategic Alignment?\nThe most important element of your L&D strategy is its alignment to your overall organizational strategy. \nStrategic alignment\n\u00a0is the process of prioritizing the training function\u2019s goals and mission around key business priorities to ensure that business results are achieved.\u00a0To achieve strategic alignment, you'll need to draw clear connections between your L&D strategy and organizational goals.\nHere are five tips for developing (and maintaining) your L&D strategy.\nBuild relationships\n with key stakeholders and develop open lines of communication to understand their goals and priorities.\nUnderstand your resources\n, both internal and external, so you can consider all of your options before deciding on solutions.\nUnderstand your learners\n in terms of their needs and preferences to create solutions that will work for their unique context.\nBe realistic\n with your budget and timeline, expect things to take longer, and cost more, than you initially predict.\nPrioritize sustainability\n for a plan you can stick to. This means opting for long-term, future-oriented solutions over short-term, quick fixes.\nThe Strategic Planning Workshop: Your One-Stop-Shop for L&D Strategy\nLooking for more help?

    "body": "You don't often get email from office@sietareu.org. \nLearn why this is important\nSubmit yours now\n \nView this email in your browser\n \nLast chance\u00a0to submit your proposal\u00a0for the SIETAR-Europa 2024 Congress in Lille, France\n\u00a0\nPropose your session here\n \n\u00a0\nSystems: the ecosystem of interculturalism\nIntercultural Communication was never and will never exist in isolation from other fields. In fact, it was born out of a variety of different disciplines: anthropology, linguistics, psychology, ethnography, etc., to name only a few. Intercultural Communication as a field came of age in a time and place that influenced its becoming: A slowly decolonizing (and not quite decolonizing) world still rife with power differences, dependencies, and in search of new ways of extracting value beyond overt domination. In recent years new perspectives have come into view that have deeply influenced the intercultural scene. From neuroscience to anti-racist justice, from migration studies to critical history; new voices, paradigms, and perspectives begin to have a significant influence on how we make sense of what it means to work on, in, and for intercultural communication.\u00a0\nThis congress wants to explore these systemic dependencies and place interculturalism into a paradigm that looks ahead by acknowledging its past and that shapes its future with intention. We want to begin inventing solutions for problems that are emerging on the horizon, give space for difficult conversations that address the roots of divisions, animosities, and violence, and learn from each other the practical ways in which we can advance communication, co-creation, and constructive dialogue; together.\n\u00a0 \nThe WHAT?\nWe live in tumultuous times. New questions are on everyone\u2019s mind that rhyme with history, yet at the same time they seem unprecedented and overwhelming. Reflecting on these questions together might shed some light into the ecosystem of ways to understand the world where interculturalism can help. Here are some starting points that might help you think about how you can best contribute to the congress. These are not prescriptive, but we hope that they might inspire you:\u00a0\nInterculturalism and the political reality of now:\u00a0\nHow do you work towards mutual acceptance and understanding when war is raging both in the middle of Europe and in so many other locations in the world, year after year?\nHow can we engage with human rights and social justice in places near and far? And how could we include new voices - often hidden and silenced - in conversations concerning human rights and social justice in a way that avoids promoting a singular cultural narrative?\u00a0\nHow do we bridge political divisions in our communities when populism, conspiracy myths, and hatred dominate so much of the political discourse?\u00a0\nWhat could be our roles and responsibilities in relation to the treatment, reception, representation, and integration of asylum seekers and refugees in the current political context of increasing hostility and rejection?\nInterculturalism and the future of knowledge:\u00a0\nHow could interculturalism contribute to education systems fit for the future?\nHow and why to decolonize knowledge on and about intercultural communication?\nIn what ways could intercultural training\u00a0be transformative spaces of change?\nIn what ways can big data and large language models improve research practices to understand the phenomenon of culture more deeply than previously possible?\u00a0\nTo what degree is Artificial Intelligence capable of being interculturally competent? Are intercultural trainers, coaches, consultants, and researchers automatable?\nHow can interculturalists make meaningful contributions to address bias in Artificial Intelligence technologies?\nInterculturalism and the livability of this planet:\u00a0\nHow to address the paradox of the desire to travel, to build a career around global mobility, or the internationalization of business if these very actions contribute so significantly to the decline of the health of this planet?\nGlobal migration patterns will be amplified by extreme weather threats, particularly for the most vulnerable. What are the challenges awaiting the intercultural field that come with that?\u00a0\u00a0\n\u00a0\nWhat are ways for interculturalists to contribute to the healing of this planet?\u00a0\n\u00a0\nThe HOW:\u00a0\nAt our Congress, each session will be a 1.5-hour block. You can submit proposals for the following formats.\u00a0\nResearch\n\u00a0\nPresentations\nIf you have done research these past years that culminated in interesting insights connected to the theme of the congress, we invite you to share it with the community. Your presentation should be around 20 minutes long. We will group your presentation with others that pull on a similar string and also appoint a Panel Chair, to moderate the discussions that follow. If you have suggestions on who to be paired with or who should chair the panel, please let us know.\u00a0The Research Presentations are part of the Academic Research Stream, managed in partnership with IACCM.\u00a0\n \n\u00a0\nProject Reflections\n:\u00a0\nThese sessions can include several presenters. You can go deep into presenting more complex research projects, learning initiatives, or developments of tools, frameworks or other collaborations.\u00a0\u00a0\n \n\u00a0\nWorkshops\n:\u00a0\nWorkshops should be highly interactive: learning through doing, making, feeling, and sharing. A practical way to build up each other\u2019s skills, be generous with our methods, and, hopefully, have fun together at the same time.\u00a0\n \n\u00a0\nDeep Dives:\nThese sessions focus on one topic. They are about thinking together and going deeper than is possible alone. This might include a presentation or a talk to kick things off but then focus on discussion and collective ideation.\u00a0\nOne way to do a deep dive might be, for example, an \u2018In Conversation\u2019 format, where you and a second person coming from different fields or perspectives engage in dialogue on the subject and then open the conversation up to the participants in the session. But be creative - this is a new format for a SIETAR Europa Congress.\u00a0\n \n\u00a0\u00a0\nInsight fireworks:\nIf you have a talk that you think everyone should hear together, then we invite you to submit a proposal for the insight fireworks session: short talks in front of everyone; 6-8 minutes, not longer.\u00a0 \u00a0\n\u00a0 \nPropose your session here\n \n\u00a0\nPolicy on Hybrid:\u00a0\nWe want to make sure as many people as possible can participate in the SEU Congress. We also want to make sure that those who participate online have an excellent experience. In order to achieve this, we have the following policy on hybrid sessions:\n \nIf you are going to offer your session in a hybrid format, at least one of your contributors must be online, and at least one is present on-site.\u00a0\nOnly research presentations and project reflections can be hybrid.\u00a0\nWorkshops or Deep Dives must be either fully online or fully in-person.\nInsight Fireworks as well as all other plenary sessions will be streamed online.\u00a0\nAt any time, only 2 to 3 hybrid sessions can run in parallel in order to ensure adequate tech and production support for each one.\u00a0\n\u00a0\n \nCongress Registration\nRegistration for the Congress will open in \nFebruary 2024.\n Please be aware that only those sessions can stay in the program where the person proposing the session has registered for the Congress. In principle, however, we hope that you are aware that presenting at the SEU-Congress tends to involve costs such as registration fees, and travel to and accommodation in Lille. Members of SIETAR Europa and its member organisations as well as members of IACCM will receive a member\u2019s discount. We are aware that this can still be a burden to many and we are trying to find ways to make this Congress as accessible as possible. If you need support, please reach out to us.\nPropose your session here\n \n\u00a0\nBest wishes.\nThe SIETAR Europa Congress Steering Committee\n \n \nShare\n \n \nTweet\n \n \nShare\n \n \nForward\n \nCopyright \u00a9 2023 SIETAR EUROPA, All rights reserved.\nSIETAR\nPlease do not reply to this email.

What are the key choices and thoughtful compromises that must be made for workers to thrive as well as produce? How can managers be trained to make the well-being of their workers a top priority? How can companies get a better sense of which benefits and rewards are most effective\u2013and encourage workers to take advantage of them.\u00a0\nFeb. 14, 2024 -\u00a0Getting to the Next Stage of Diversity and Belonging\u00a0\nAt a time of resistance and corporate austerity, DEI advocates will need to re-energize themselves and their organizations with new ideas, programs, and reasoning for the cause of diversity. What can DEI practitioners learn from companies with consistent success? How are companies changing their policies to respond to court rulings and lawsuits? What practices have brought the most progress in bringing diversity to leadership rank\n \nMarch 6, 2024 -\u00a0Employee Engagement: Tapping the Secrets of Energizing Workers\u00a0\nCompanies want their employees to be enthused and involved, yet employers need to be thoughtful in fostering these qualities in authentic ways. What\u2019s the latest thinking about how employers can understand the motivations of their workers\u2013and how to respond? What are the best methods for recognizing achievement, both individually and among teams? What\u2019s the connection between engagement and job satisfaction? In the hybrid work environment, what binds workers together and wards off anxiety and loneliness?\n \nApril 3, 2024 -\u00a0Benefits that Fit Individual Needs Without Busting the Budge\nHaving made a commitment to recognize the unique needs of individuals, the secret is in the execution. What are the emerging benefits and rewards that workers are seeking, from fertility care to financial wellness? How can companies use technology to stay in close touch with what individuals are experiencing\u2013and where they need help as a result? How can companies choose among myriad point solutions and innovative new platforms? What are the most cost-effective rewards in terms of investments and outcomes\nMay 22, 2024 -\u00a0The Art and Science of Employee Retention, Coaching and Advancement\nWhile the pace of job-hopping has eased, employers have a powerful motivation to retain skilled workers, both for financial and cultural reasons. How can employers use new tools, including AI, to gain insights about what\u2019s inspiring their workers to stay committed\u2013or walk out the door? Since attrition is often caused by poor relationships with managers, what are innovative ways for employers to train their workers to be better leaders at a time when workers have higher expectations for job satisfaction? How can technology help make coaching more effective?\nJune 12, 2024 -\u00a0Bringing Talent Acquisition into the Digital Age\nDespite layoffs making headlines now, all the demographic and digital trends point toward tough competition for workers in the future\u2013maybe sooner than most expect. What are the new techniques and tools that talent-acquisition can use to envision the workforce their company will need in the future? What data and insights can HR and TA leaders provide to the company to be ahead of trends? How can companies do a better job of internal recruiting and promoting internal mobility? What are the best practices for hiring based on skills and potential, rather than credentials?\n\u00a0July 10, 2024 -\u00a0Learning and Development: How New Tools Are Changing Upskilling and Career Mobility\u00a0\n\u00a0\n \nAs employers put more emphasis on skills as the currency for worker development, they\u2019re seeking new ways to measure them, fill in gaps, and predict the skills needed in the future. How can these new tools, including AI, create better matches between employees and projects? How can employers gain insights from the data they gather? Why do real-world simulations help measure certain skills better than traditional assessments?\u00a0\n\u00a0July 17, 2024 -\u00a0Innovative Benefits That Support Healthy Families and Caregivers\n\u00a0\n \nAs the pandemic\u2019s caregiving crisis showed, employers found significant gaps in their support for the parents and other caregivers in their workforces. The resulting scramble to help has produced a wealth of new HR policies, benefit offerings, and management practices. Where is the greatest demand for support, as well as the most innovative new methods? What have been the most cost-effective ways to help caregivers of all kinds, including parents as well as \u201csandwich generation\u201d workers caring for elderly and disabled relatives?\u00a0\n\u00a0Aug. 7, 2024 -\u00a0Employee Engagement: Using Technology to Gain Insight Into Work Needs and Ambitions\n \n\u00a0\nTraditional methods like town-hall meetings and surveys can be effective, but data and well-drawn insights can give top leaders a heads up about evolving patterns and trends in their workforces. How can AI and other technology be deployed in a way that brings new insights yet still respects privacy and the individual human factors at play? What approaches will bring employers new empathy for worker needs, ambitions, and well-being?\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\nAug. 28, 2024 -\u00a0Pursuing Higher Productivity With Human Factors in Mind\n\u00a0\n \nIn a competitive and uncertain climate, most companies need to do more with less. Yet if workers are their greatest asset, employers need to make sure the push for greater output is sustainable. What is the latest thinking about how to measure productivity, the means for stimulating it, and ensuring that workers have the energy to meet their goals\u2013as well as thrive over the long run?\nSept. 18, 2024 -\u00a0Building a Corporate Culture That Workers Can Understand, Influence and Embrace\u00a0\u00a0\nCompany culture is amorphous yet vital\u2013the shared beliefs, values, traditions and behaviors that drive the actions of individuals and the organization as a whole. Who should be the architects of a company\u2019s culture and how should it be designed and constructed? How should the culture be communicated, broadly and in everyday actions? How should a company start out on a project to evolve its culture in a credible way?\u00a0\u00a0\nOct. 16, 2024 -\u00a0Modernizing Your Workplace for a More Flexible, Inclusive Era\n\u00a0\n \nThe arrival of hybrid work sent virtually every employer back to the drawing board about what the workplace should look like, including floor plans, digital platforms, meetings, and even office furniture. After more than three years of experimenting, what have innovative companies discovered about what works\u2013and what doesn\u2019t? How have they improved workplace environments to be healthier, as well as more productive? How have these changes affected the goals of diversity, equity, inclusion, and belonging?\n\u00a0\nNov. 20, 2024 -\u00a0Finding and Deploying HR Tech That Will Empower Workers\u00a0\u00a0\n\u00a0\nThe blossoming of innovation in HR technology has given employers untold new abilities to organize, inspire, develop, reward, and care for their workers. Yet this revolution presents new challenges for companies in choosing and supervising these tech tools. How should these tech platforms be evaluated? Which departments of the company should take responsibility\u2013and how can organizations coordinate these moves? How can companies make sure they\u2019re empowering their workers rather than overloading them with adaptation and distraction?\n\u00a0\nDec. 11, 2024 -\u00a0Pioneering Approaches to Digital Transformation and the Future of Work\n\u00a0\nThe emergence of generative AI in 2023 marked the arrival of a transforming technology that will change human roles, add and subtract jobs, and create astounding new capabilities. How can companies manage the transition, both from the short-term competitive pressures to\u00a0 long-term corporate survival? How can AI be used to unleash creativity? Where are the areas for abuse, intentional or otherwise? How will digital transformation affect fields from talent acquisition to learning and development?\nPaul Morrongiello\nFrom Day One\n732.580.3287\n\u00a0\nhttps://calendly.com/paulmorrongiello\nWould you like to opt out?\nOn Oct 30, 2023 11:19 AM, \"Paul Morrongiello\" <\npaul@fromdayone.co\n> wrote:\nMelissa,\nWe're pleased to share that we were joined by over 500 CHRO, VPs of HR and People Leaders on the east coast across our Philadelphia and Manhattan events.

Mark your calendar: 12/ 6 at noon for \u201cLet\u2019s Talk Talent: Examining the Talent Lifecycle Through an Intercultural Competence Lens\u201d (75 min: 1-hr presentation & 15 min Q&A) Join us for a session that will give you an overview of what it takes to build and maintain a sustainable culture of inclusion throughout your talent processes. In this session, we\u2019ll share strategies and characteristics of organizations that fall under one of three talent systems stages: \u201cUnstructured/Defining\u201d, \u201cImplementing\u201d or \u201cOptimizing\u201d \u2013 around the following: Capability / Training Infrastructure Attracting & Recruiting Talent Interviewing & Hiring Talent Engaging & Retaining Talent Managing Performance & Career Advancement Pipeline Development & Talent Review Measurement & Accountability Presenters from LCW (Language and Culture Worldwide), explain their Sustainable Culture of Inclusion (SCI) Model, a framework for understanding what \u201csuccess across cultures\u201d looks like as well as a roadmap for creating it. Its grounding premise is that a sustainable, inclusive culture exists when there is: (a) a critical mass of people (especially leaders) with mindsets that are proficient in intercultural competence, as well as (b) optimized, inclusive talent & people management systems. Success across both dimensions produces both a positive working experience and equitable outcomes for all. We can\u2019t do everything, all at once, right now \u2013 but this session will provide you with a structure that you can utilize to prioritize and plan for your organization. We hope you can join us for this valuable session. Get to know our facilitator, Sarah Nodarse from LCW. << RTF: Rich object >> Sarah Nodarse, Ph.D., Principal Consultant As a consultant and facilitator, Sarah helps leaders, teams, and organizations cultivate their potential and accelerate performance.

How this is set up is your preference; however, if you want to keep some emails private, you must remember to remove the check on the log and track settings in Outlook. \u00a0\u00a0If this isn\u2019t a preferred setting, Pedro knows how to change these settings.\n\u00a0\nYou might want to consider reassigning the contacts in HubSpot to either of you.\n The workflows are set up because if one of my contacts fills out the website form, I will get alerted, but the two of you won\u2019t.

How this is set up is your preference; however, if you want to keep some emails private, you must remember to remove the check on the log and track settings in Outlook. \u00a0\u00a0If this isn\u2019t a preferred setting, Pedro knows how to change these settings.\n\u00a0\nYou might want to consider reassigning the contacts in HubSpot to either of you.\n The workflows are set up because if one of my contacts fills out the website form, I will get alerted, but the two of you won\u2019t.
