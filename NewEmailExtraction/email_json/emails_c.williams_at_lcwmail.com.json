We've long been asked by customers big and small for the ability to: \nBook flights, hotels, rail, and car rentals from inside the app.\nLimit what inventory employees see to only what is in the authorized travel policy.\nPay for these bookings using a central virtual card.\nCapture the travel receipts into an automatic expense report.\nCut travel costs\nIn \nNew Expensify\n, press the green + button \n> Book travel\n (or in \nExpensify Classic\n, click the \nTravel\n button along the left side of the screen). It does all the things you expect (in-policy booking results, travel-based spend analysis, out-of-policy notices, approvals before booking, duty-of-care reporting), plus a few tricks you don't \u2013 courtesy of the realtime chat framework of the New Expensify superapp: \nRealtime duty of care\n, which lets you know where all your employees are at all times. We even connect the traveler and travel manager in a dedicated chat room to discuss all bookings and changes the instant they happen, rather than whenever you get around to checking your inbox.\nRealtime expense management,\n where every booking receipt and change fee is recorded as an expense that's submitted up through Expensify's realtime approval and next-day reimbursement engine: book today, get paid tomorrow!\nRealtime collaboration\n, where shared trip chat rooms are automatically created in New Expensify so that everyone is on the same page. From employees to managers, everything you need to know about your trip, all in one place. \nThe instant, chat-first design of New Expensify is why we like to say that Expensify does:\nTravel and expense at the speed of chat.\nTo check it out, open your Expensify app and click \nTravel\n, or take a peek below!\nIt's one of the most exciting times to be at Expensify that I can ever remember. We have a \nlot\n going on, and it's energizing to be sharing it with you after so long in development. Keep an eye out for a ton more on the way!\n-david\nFounder and CEO of Expensify\nQuestions?

[\nhttps://click.zoom.com/l/84442/2024-07-22/c5fptt/84442/1721653856lVtLOzdS/zm_cs_banner_bloom.png\n] [\nhttps://zoom.com\n] Dear Valued Customer, In\n \nRedesigned Team Chat sidebar, plus a look back at 2024! \n \nDear Valued Customer,\n\u00a0\nIn 2024, Zoom took major steps to unify the working experience through the launch of Workplace and introduction of productivity tools like Zoom Docs. We also introduced a new generation of AI assistant \u2014 AI Companion 2.0 \u2014 to help you work and collaborate more efficiently and effectively. \n\u00a0\nBefore we dive into a recap of 2024, let\u2019s take a look at how we\u2019re kicking off the new year!\n\u00a0\n*Note: Some products and features may not be available to all customers.\n \nNew this year: Redesigned flexible Team Chat sidebar\n \nWhen you update to Zoom app version 6.3.6, you may notice the newly redesigned Team Chat sidebar. With the new customizable sidebar, you can easily organize your workspace by choosing which tabs appear with drag and drop, keeping essentials like direct messages and continuous meeting chats just a click away, decluttering notifications with tab-level badging, accessing a full-suite of tabs under \u201cMore,\u201d and quickly finding what you need using advanced sorting and filtering. \nPlus, you can use AI Companion to automate everyday busywork so you can stay on top of what matters and get more done by summarizing unread conversations in key tabs like Folders and Starred, generating action items based on a conversation in any channel, searching for topics and files across chats, and composing messages for you \u2014 all in one place. \nCheck out our \nblog post\n if you want to learn more about what's possible with Team Chat!\nService Updates\n \nZoom Software Lifecycle Policy -\n \nWe plan to enforce the next round of our Software Lifecycle Policy on February 1, 2025. Please check our \nsupport article\n for the table of products and corresponding minimum versions. Users who are running an end-of-life version after February 1 will be logged out of their Zoom app (Desktop, Mobile, and VDI) or not be able to join meetings via the Zoom Client until they update. As always, we highly recommend you regularly download and update to the latest version of Zoom software by checking for updates within the Zoom app or by navigating to \nzoom.us/download\n to take advantage of all our latest security and functionality features.\n \nZoom firewall settings -\n \nWe are starting to route more traffic across our newer data centers. We want to remind customers to please allow Zoom traffic to all subnets located on our\u00a0\nZoom Network Firewall\n page, which includes specific sections by Product, for an optimal experience and to avoid any service disruption. Some of the recently added subnets specific to Zoom Phone & Zoom Contact Center are:\n \n144.195.0.0/16\n \n206.247.0.0/16\n \n170.114.0.0/16\n \n159.124.0.0/16\n \n147.124.96.0/19\n \nHighlights from 2024\n \nNow that we\u2019ve looked at how we\u2019re kicking off the new year, here are just a few of the many milestones from 2024:\u00a0\n \nFast Company names Zoom one of the world\u2019s most innovative companies of 2024\n \n-\n Zoom was named to Fast Company\u2019s prestigious list of the World\u2019s Most Innovative Companies of 2024. The list shines a spotlight on businesses that are shaping industry and culture through their innovations. These organizations are setting new standards and achieving remarkable milestones in all sectors of the economy. Alongside the World\u2019s 50 Most Innovative Companies, Fast Company recognizes 606 organizations across 58 sectors and regions.\n \nZoom Compliance Manager launches\n \n-\n In the spring of 2024, we launched Zoom Compliance Manager powered by Theta Lake, a new all-in-one offering that provides archiving, eDiscovery, legal hold, and information protection capabilities to help organizations fulfill regulatory requirements and mitigate organizational communications compliance risks across the Zoom platform.\n \nZoom Workplaces launches, weaving AI throughout the experience\n \n-\n \nIn April 2024, we launched Zoom Workplace, our new, AI-powered collaboration platform designed to help your organization reimagine teamwork by streamlining communications, increasing employee engagement, and improving productivity across flexible work. It\u2019s everything you trust and love about Zoom\u2019s core communications products, combined with our employee engagement, spaces, and productivity solutions, all within the Zoom experience, with AI woven throughout.\u00a0\n \nAI Onboarding Center helps organizations integrate AI Companion\n \n-\n Many tasks can be completed more quickly and efficiently with the help of AI Companion, but that doesn\u2019t mean everyone knows how to take advantage of them. To help administrators and employees take advantage of Zoom AI Companion and start changing the way they work, we created a new \nresource hub\n with downloadable, ready-to-share assets for every product that works with Zoom AI Companion.\n \nZoom introduces beta for Workflow Automation, a no-code workflow builder to boost workplace efficiency\n \n-\n \nZoom launched the new Workflow Automation in beta, allowing users to increase efficiency and reduce time spent on routine tasks. Workflow Automation helps users build complex workflows across Zoom Workplace and third-party applications so they can spend time on more meaningful work and collaborate more seamlessly with colleagues.\u00a0\n \nSingle-use Zoom Webinars licenses capacity increased to 1 million attendees\n \n-\n\u00a0We made it easier than ever to host an extra-large, high-capacity virtual gathering with our newest offering: single-use Zoom Webinars licenses that accommodate up to 1 million attendees. Ideal for presenting content to large audiences who don\u2019t need to connect their audio and video to one another, Zoom Webinars is built on our easy-to-use, familiar platform that so many customers have come to know and trust. Our flexible and scalable solutions now enable event organizers to host massive, one-time virtual gatherings with relative ease.\n \nAI-first Zoom Docs debuts on Zoom Workplace\n \n-\n In August 2024, Zoom launched our AI-first collaborative docs solution. Zoom Docs is powered by Zoom AI Companion, and helps drive productivity and seamless collaboration throughout Zoom Workplace. Zoom Docs can help solve critical challenges facing modern workforces, including time wasted on repetitive tasks, information overload, and facilitation of cross-functional alignment. By utilizing Zoom AI Companion to convert meeting outcomes into actionable documents, Zoom Docs can jumpstart content creation and adapt to different individual and team needs to help boost workers\u2019 productivity.\u00a0\n \nWorkvivo named the only preferred migration partner for Workplace from Meta\n \n-\n \nAs Meta prepared to discontinue their Workplace product, they named Workvivo by Zoom as their only preferred migration partner. Meta and Workvivo worked together to provide \nmigration tools\n for migrating and Workvivo provided additional migration services at no further cost to support customers\u2019 transition.\n \nZoom recognized as a Customers\u2019 Choice in the Gartner\u00ae Peer Insights\u2122\n \n-\n Zoom was recognized as a Customers\u2019 Choice in the 2024 Gartner\u00ae Peer Insights\u2122 \u201cVoice of the Customer\u201d report for Unified Communications as a Service (UCaaS). According to Gartner, vendors recognized by customers as a Customers\u2019 Choice meet or exceed the market average for Overall Experience and User Interest and Adoption.\u00a0\n \nZoom introduces AI Companion 2.0\n \n-\n\u00a0At Zoomtopia 2024, Zoom announced the next generation of Zoom AI Companion, the AI personal assistant that helps users get more done and is available at no additional cost. Since launching in September 2023, AI Companion has been enabled on more than 4 million accounts, helping users with capabilities like meeting summary, meeting questions, chat compose, and more. The next generation of AI Companion continues to help simplify users\u2019 workdays by sorting through the noise and prioritizing what\u2019s most important with high-quality results.\u00a0\n \nZoom named a Leader in the 2024 Gartner\u00ae Magic Quadrant\u2122(October) Gartner Magic Quadrant\n \n-\n \nGartner named Zoom a Leader in the 2024 Gartner\u00ae Magic Quadrant\u2122 for Unified Communications as a Service (UCaaS), Worldwide for the fifth time in a row. The UCaaS report evaluated 11 companies in the unified communications space, and Zoom has been recognized as a Leader in this area. Zoom includes enterprise-grade solutions like Zoom AI Companion, Zoom Contact Center, Zoom Team Chat, Zoom Phone, Zoom Meetings, and Workvivo.\u00a0\n \nMeet the new Zoom\n \n-\n Until November 2024, Zoom\u2019s official name was Zoom Video Communications Inc., reflecting the company\u2019s roots in video communications software.

Clear communication sets the foundation for a strong, productive relationship that benefits everyone.\nMentoring Programs\nWhen establishing a mentoring program, start by \ncreating a clear definition of mentoring \nand its key elements: its purpose, who it is for, the skills required, and its ultimate goals. A well-defined framework ensures alignment, sets clear expectations, and maximizes the program\u2019s impact for both mentors and mentees.\nREADY TO MAKE A DIFFERENCE?

Review our \nLegal and Compliance Guide to AI Companion\n for practical guidance on common approaches for customers to tailor their AI Companion experience to meet their unique legal, compliance, and privacy needs.\nKey Highlights from Zoom\u2019s November Releases\nZoom Workplace\n \nUpdates\n\u00a0\nMeetings Features\n\u00a0\nUnified experience for managing meeting assets\n \n(Windows, macOS, Linux) -\n \nUsers can view and manage meeting assets consistently before, during, and after meetings within the meeting scheduler, calendar card, in-meeting page, and full meeting details page. Meeting assets have a unified UI/UX with consistent grouping, categorization, and functionality across the meeting lifecycle. The calendar meeting card allows users to view the full meeting, transcript, and recording directly within the card, and includes options to share the recording and release it to the cloud meeting client. This provides a seamless experience for accessing and interacting with meeting assets.\nEnhancements to AI Companion enablement in meeting scheduler (Windows, macOS, Linux) -\n \nA meeting host can enable AI Companion features like meeting summary, in-meeting questions, and smart recording with one click using the AI Companion diamond button. These options are available directly from the Zoom Workplace desktop app's meeting scheduler in the calendar side panel, the Calendar tab's Agenda view, and the Home tab.\n\u00a0\nSurveys & Polls Features\n\u00a0\nIntegrate surveys and polls in the Zoom desktop app (Windows, macOS, Linux) -\n \nUsers can access and manage surveys and polls directly from the Zoom desktop app. They can create new surveys or polls, manage their personal survey library, access survey or poll results, and preview surveys or polls. This integration provides a seamless experience for users to work with surveys and polls within the Zoom desktop app, eliminating the need to switch between different apps.\n\u00a0\nTeam Chat Features\n\u00a0\nContinuous Meeting Chat (CMC) apps: In-chat app viewer for seamless content viewing (Windows, macOS, Linux, iOS, Android) -\n Users can view unfurled app content within the chat window without leaving the conversation context. When an app link is shared, users can open and interact with the content directly in the chat, providing a seamless experience.\n\u00a0\nClip Features\n\u00a0\nEnhancements to admin control for embed feature -\n \nAccount owners and admins have the option to enable or disable the Clip Embed feature for their entire organization. When enabled, users can embed their recorded clips in external websites or applications, facilitating easy sharing and collaboration. Conversely, disabling the Embed feature restricts clips from being shared outside the organization, ensuring better control over sensitive data and content.\nAutomatic chapter generation and editing capabilities in Clips (Windows, macOS, Linux, iOS, Android) -\n \nUsers can automatically generate chapter breakdowns using Zoom AI Companion after recording clips. This feature allows users to easily navigate through their recorded clips by providing a structured overview of the content. Additionally, users have the ability to modify the automatically generated chapters to better suit their preferences.\n\u00a0\nZoom Phone Features\n\u00a0\nDisplay icon for available AI call summary in Zoom Assistant for Microsoft users (Windows, macOS, Linux) -\n \nMicrosoft users can easily identify when an AI-generated summary of their call is ready for review. The Zoom Assistant interface will display an icon to notify users that a summary is available. This enhancement streamlines the process of accessing AI-powered call insights, enabling users to quickly review and leverage the summarized information. This feature must be enabled by Zoom.\n\u00a0\nZoom Contact Center\n Updates\n\u00a0\nDynamic agent guide (web portal) -\n \nAdmins can create conditional steps in the agent guide, allowing the guide to adjust dynamically based on previous steps. When following the guide, agents can choose from a set of options which determines the next step. Agents can return to previous steps to update answers if needed. This makes agent guides adaptable across different scenarios, improving the responsiveness to customer needs.\nSentiment analysis with AI Companion for CTI connector (CTI Connector) -\n \nAgents using the CTI connector can view real-time sentiment analysis for any active voice or messaging engagement. Sentiment values (Positive, Neutral, or Negative) appear as soon as the consumer's first message is received and update automatically as more messages or speech come in. Supervisors can monitor sentiment on their dashboards, allowing them to step in if needed. This feature is especially helpful for recognizing if a consumer is frustrated, allowing agents to adjust their conversation style to help de-escalate. This is available in CTI version V3 and must be enabled by Zoom.\u00a0\nImproved context sharing for transferred engagements (CTI Connector) -\n \nWhen a voice engagement is transferred between agents in Zoom Contact Center, the new agent receives the full context of the interaction. This includes the customer's information, any records or cases created by the previous agent, and notes taken during the engagement. For scenarios with multiple potential customer matches, clarifying information gathered by the first agent is also passed to the next agent. This is available in CTI version V3 and must be enabled by Zoom. \n\u00a0\nZoom Revenue Accelerator\n \nUpdates\u00a0\n\u00a0\nManagers can update deal data for their teams (Web portal) -\n \nAccount owners and admins have the ability to allow managers to update deal data for the sellers on their teams. This permission is configured at the user level within the Zoom for Salesforce Lightning application, where managers must authenticate to gain access. With this feature, managers can make changes to deal data during one-on-one coaching sessions, enabling them to better guide and assist their team members in the sales process.\n\u00a0\nZoom Virtual Agent\n Updates\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\nGoogle Drive integration with Zoom Virtual Agent (Web portal) -\n \nAdmins can connect to Google Drive and use content from their organization's drive to find answers from .doc, .PDF and HTML files, which are formatted for system use. They can select specific files or folders, choose content from within their organization or any shared links, and set specific drive folders to control what's included. This new knowledge base type broadens the range of available sources, enabling the Virtual Agent to provide more comprehensive responses.\nService Updates\nZoom Software Lifecycle Policy -\u00a0\nWe plan to enforce the next round of our Software Lifecycle Policy on February 1, 2025. Please check our \nsupport article\n for the table of products and corresponding minimum versions. Users who are running an end-of-life version after February 1 will be logged out of their Zoom app (Desktop, Mobile, and VDI) or not be able to join meetings via the Zoom Client until they update.

AI Companion 2.0 is available across Zoom Workplace in a convenient side panel to help users stay up-to-date on important conversations, synthesize information to make faster, more informed decisions, and take action, all with \nreliable, responsible AI\n. For more information, check out our recent \nannouncement\n and support article on \nhow to enable the AI Companion panel in Zoom Workplace\n.\u00a0\n \n\u00a0\nBusiness Updates\nZoom: A Leader in the 2024 Gartner\u00ae Magic Quadrant\u2122 for UCaaS report\n - Gartner has named Zoom a leader in the 2024 Magic Quadrant for UCaaS, Worldwide. Read our recent blog and download the report to learn why we\u2019re a leader!\n \n\u00a0\nKey Highlights from Zoom\u2019s October Releases\n\u00a0\nZoom Workplace App\n \nUpdates\n\u00a0\nTeam Chat Features\nSend message to multiple chats or channels at the same time (Win, macOS, iOS, Android) -\n \nUsers composing a message in Team Chat can now choose to send it to multiple chosen contacts, groups, and channels simultaneously. The message will appear as natively sent in each conversation. Before sending, users can edit the list of recipients. After sending, users can modify the message content from each sent location. This streamlines sharing information across multiple conversations in Team Chat.\n \nImage annotation for shared images in Zoom Team Chat (Win, macOS) - \nUsers can annotate any image shared in Zoom Team Chat by clicking on the image and selecting the Annotate option. The image opens in an annotation interface, allowing users to mark up the image using various annotation tools. Users can then save the annotated image back into the chat as a new message. This feature streamlines the workflow by enabling direct annotation within the chat, reducing the need for external tools. Note: This feature is available only on macOS and Windows.\n \n\u00a0\nContact Center Features\n\u00a0\nOutbound WhatsApp messages (Win, macOS, Linux) - \nAgents and users with appropriate permissions can initiate new outbound engagements by sending WhatsApp messages to WhatsApp-compatible phone numbers globally using their integrated WhatsApp Business numbers. When sending a message, users must select an active WhatsApp message template. Customers will be charged based on message template type and recipient country.\n \n\u00a0\nZoom Workspace Reservation\n Updates\nNew reservation administrator role management options (web app)\n - \nAccount owners and admins can assign a new reservation administrator that can create, edit or delete reservations for the account or location. Admins can control the level of access for Booking Admins by location. This feature must be enabled by Zoom.\n \n\u00a0\nContact Center\n \nUpdates\nPass Zoom Contact Center variables to integrated third-party apps (web portal) -\n\u00a0\nAccount owners and admins can configure Zoom Contact Center to send global variables to third-party apps. They can create rules to link Zoom variables with data fields in those apps and decide which variables can be accessed. Passing variables into third-party apps allows app developers to use the data to create more personalized and contextually aware experiences for agents while handling engagements. Note: Agents must be using version 6.2.5 of the Zoom client or higher for this feature to work.\n \nMulti-language support for surveys across all channels (web portal) -\n \nAccount owners and admins can create surveys in multiple languages and set a default language. For surveys in multiple languages, the Zoom Contact Center flow must set the Engagement Language. Admins can configure this by setting the language in the Start widget or using the Set Variable widget to assign the Engagement Language. Additionally, admins can set up a flow that employs a dynamic method, like the Collect Input widget for customer language selection. Surveys will trigger based on this language across voice, video, and messaging channels. If no language is set, the default version will be used. Admins can preview, edit, and delete each language version from queue settings or the flow builder. Survey language editing is now managed in Survey Management.\n \n\u00a0\nZoom Revenue Accelerator\n \nUpdates\nView Coaching Activity Tracker for sales leaders (web portal) - \nZoom Revenue Accelerator's Coaching Activity Tracker allows sales leaders to quickly understand what managers are coaching their teams and the last time that they coached them. Sales leaders can access a unified coaching metrics dashboard that provides a hierarchical, organizational view as well as a team-specific view of coaching activities. The dashboard offers clear visibility into the number of calls invited, joined, listened to, scored, and commented on during a given period. Intuitive filter selections and consistency between the team-specific and roll-up hierarchical views are included.\n \n\u00a0\nService Updates\n\u00a0\nZoom Software Lifecycle Policy - \nWe plan to enforce the next round of our Software Lifecycle Policy on February 1, 2025. Please check our \nsupport article\n for the table of products and corresponding minimum versions. Users who are running an end-of-life version after February 1 will be logged out of their Zoom app (Desktop, Mobile, and VDI) or not be able to join meetings via the Zoom Client until they update.

    "body": "Get ready for the new IDI Platform.\n \nNew IDI Platform Launches Nov. 11\nThe new IDI Platform will be launching on Monday, November 11th! The current IDI Assessment Website will be unavailable starting November 7th as we migrate to the Platform.\nIn our last email, we presented some of the new features the new IDI Platform will offer.\nListed below is more information to help you prepare. Also, details about upcoming Webinars dedicated to the new IDI Platform are at the bottom of the email, including a link to register.\nUnused Assessment Expiration\nIn the new IDI Platform, unused Assessments will expire after two (2) years. They can still be re-assigned to a new respondent after purchase within that two-year timeframe.\nUnused \u201cLegacy\u201d Assessments (IDI Login Codes from the current system that have not been submitted) will start their two-year expiration window at Launch.

These are not compatible with the Platform\u2019s infrastructure.\nSubmitted IDI data in archived accounts will also not migrate, regardless of order date. If you are receiving this and have an IDI account, then your account is active.\nThe current version of IDI Reports (Profile Reports and IDPs) will no longer be available in the Platform.

Instead, to create an IDI Group Profile Report or organize your respondents into specific groups, you will need to create a new Report Group and add each respondent (individually or in bulk) to that Report Group (or multiple Report Groups, as needed).

However, should you have any Online IDI Debriefs that were ordered as a separate purchase in the current IDI Assessment Website, these will be available as IDI Individual Profile Reviews in the new Platform.

    "body": "Dear \nConner\n,\u00a0\n \nWhether it's new products and features or courses that teach you to use Zoom better, we are constantly evolving to improve your experience. To help keep you up to date, we have summarized some key new things you should know below. \nDownload\n the latest version of the Zoom desktop client to access all these features and more.\u00a0\n\u00a0\nThis is only a selection of the many updates happening on the Zoom platform, so to help you stay up to date, check out:\n\u00a0\nPreview notes\n \u2013 A list of upcoming features. This page is only available to Zoom account owners and admins; you must sign in to view them.\nRelease notes\n \u2013 A complete list of past releases across the Zoom platform.\u00a0\n\u00a0\nIf you have questions about the features and announcements outlined below, please reply directly to this email.\n\u00a0\n*Note: Some products and features may not be available to all customers.\n\u00a0\nEvents & Training\nRegistration is open for Zoomtopia 2024!\n Zoomtopia, our flagship conference, is back for 2024! During this year\u2019s virtual event on Oct. 9, we\u2019re spotlighting groundbreaking innovations that are transforming the way we connect and collaborate. \nReview the agenda and register today! \nOn-demand Webinar: Zoom\u2019s Approach to AI Privacy and Security\n\u00a0- Sign up to watch our recent webinar on how Zoom tackles trust, data privacy, and security in AI implementation. We dig into the controls Zoom provides to help accounts roll out Zoom AI Companion features safely and securely within their organization. Then, we hear from Zoom\u2019s Chief Information Security Officer, Michael Adams, and Chief Privacy Officer, Lisa Owings, as they discuss Zoom\u2019s data security, privacy, and compliance strategy, emphasizing the importance of trust in Zoom\u2019s platform. \nKey Highlights from Zoom\u2019s September Releases \nZoom Workplace App\n\u00a0\nUpdates \nManage signed-in devices and sessions -\n Windows, macOS, Linux, iOS, iOS (Intune), Android, Android (Intune) - From both the Zoom Workplace app and the Web Portal, users can manage devices and sessions where they are logged in, with the ability to log out of individual devices or log out of all devices and sessions. This feature may not be immediately available, as it is dependent on a backend server update. \nMeeting Features \nAbility for participants to enable AI companion and meeting summary without host - \nWindows, macOS, Linux, iOS, iOS (Intune), Android, Android (Intune) - The Allow participants to start AI Companion when the host is not in the meeting setting has been added to the web portal. This setting allows account owners and admins to let participants activate Zoom AI Companion features, such as Ask AI Companion and Meeting Summary, within the Workplace app before the host joins. However, if the Ask AI Companion and Meeting Summary features are not enabled, participants will receive a prompt stating that the host must be present to start using them. \nTeam Chat Features \nGranular controls for message editing and deletion in Team Chat -\n Windows, macOS, Linux, iOS, Android - Users can be restricted from editing or deleting messages in Team Chat based on account and group settings configured by admins. These settings allow admins to maintain message integrity and compliance. If a user belongs to multiple groups with conflicting settings, the most restrictive setting takes precedence, unless a priority group is set. This feature provides data integrity and audit trails for organizations with strict messaging requirements. \nContact Center Features \nSmart Compose with AI Companion - \nWindows, macOS - Agents can use the Smart Compose with AI Companion to generate responses to customer messages. By giving prompts or guidelines, the Smart Compose feature creates a personalized, first-person response as if the agent is speaking directly to the customer. This feature helps agents work more efficiently and offers a more personalized experience for customers. \nManual message translation - \nWindows, macOS - Account owners and admins can enable the manual translation feature for inbound messages. When enabled, agents can manually translate individual inbound messages into their preferred language, regardless of the messaging channel. This feature offers ad-hoc translation assistance for agents and supervisors communicating with international consumers. \nDisable agent camera in video engagements - \nWindows, macOS - Admins can disable the video camera for some agents in Zoom Contact Center video engagements, including video escalations. This can be applied at the account or queue level, preventing agents from using their video camera. Admins can set a default profile picture or avatar to represent agents when their camera is disabled. This feature helps contact centers control agent video presence, ensuring privacy and maintaining brand standards. This feature must be enabled by Zoom. \nZoom Phone\n\u00a0\nUpdates \nBulk site management for holidays and force majeure situations -\n Account owners and admins can make bulk updates to multiple sites' holiday hours, greetings, call routing, and other settings. For planned events like holidays, they can schedule updates in advance. In case of emergencies or last-minute events, admins can quickly select impacted sites and apply temporary changes. Updates can be made via the bulk-update interface or by importing a CSV file. Admins can also set up notifications for upcoming expiration dates and assign roles for this functionality. This empowers admins to swiftly adapt operations across their locations during changing circumstances. This feature must be enabled by Zoom. \nZoom Web\n\u00a0\nUpdates \nRemove Merge Meetings and Calendar tabs toggle - \nThe web setting to merge the Meetings and Calendar tabs has been removed from the Zoom web portal. For Zoom Workplace app version 6.2.0 and higher, the tabs are now permanently merged to enhance visibility of calendar views and meeting details. This update allows for easier access to upcoming meetings, invitee information, shared materials, and past meeting assets like recordings and chats. If your Zoom Workplace app version is lower than 6.2.0 and you have the Merge Meetings and Calendar tabs toggle disabled prior to September 16, 2024, you will still see separate tabs for Meetings and Calendar. Once you upgrade to version 6.2.0, the Calendar and Meetings tab will merge, and you won't have the option to return to separate tabs. \nZoom Events\n\u00a0\nUpdates \nAccount admins gain comprehensive visibility into the Zoom Events hub -\n Account owners and admins can access the Events and Recordings tabs within the Zoom Events hub with view permission. This enhancement provides account admins with a complete overview of the hub, enabling them to monitor usage and oversee activities more effectively. Previously, account admins had limited visibility, as they could only view certain tabs such as Summary and VOD, but not crucial sections like Event and Recording. \nAdd Pledge donation component for fundraiser events -\n Event organizers can add a pledge donation component to the Page Builder for fundraiser events. This component will appear in the components panel when an event is designated as a fundraiser type. Organizers can drag and drop the pledge component onto the editing canvas, where it will render the donate component. This component can be treated like the register component, allowing organizers to drag and drop, duplicate, delete, or save it into reusable blocks. They can customize settings like the primary button text, color, hover state, and padding for the pledge component. This feature allows organizers to create engaging fundraiser event pages with integrated pledge donation functionality. \nPromotion codes for Zoom Events hosts and attendees - \nHosts can create and manage promotion codes (discount and access codes) mapped to specific events to provide discounts on ticket purchases via discount codes and/or unlock ticket offers via access codes. Discount codes can be set up with validation rules and refund policies. Attendees can apply one code during event registration to receive the discounted price. This helps reduce event costs for hosts while making events more affordable for attendees through promotional pricing. Access codes can be set up with the validation rules and associated with the tickets of each event. Attendees can apply one access code during event registration to unlock the accessibility to the corresponding tickets. \nZoom Virtual Agent\n\u00a0\nUpdates \nTesting experience for campaigns and bot flows - \nAdmins can test their bot campaigns and flows in a sandbox environment without needing to set up websites or allowlist URLs. They can customize the sandbox to match the live site and check all campaign settings for branding. Admins can preview and test the entire consumer experience, including widgets, quick replies, knowledge base articles, and chat modals. This ensures everything looks and works right before going live. \nBot flow debugging - \nAdmins and bot flow designers can see debugging information on engagement id, widgets, knowledge base, intent matching, and HTTP calls. They can see detailed internal information like widget names and IDs, condition parameters, intent match phrases and scores, and HTTP call statuses. This helps admins find and fix issues more efficiently during testing. \nAlerts and notifications about anomalies and critical events within Intent Management - \nAdmins can receive notifications when unusual patterns in intent trends are detected, such as sudden increases or decreases in intent detection time. Alerts are triggered when the detection time exceeds a set threshold compared to the previous period. Additionally, admins can define different notifications based on the number of intents for different categories, including Untrained, Unpublished, and Suggested intents. They can customize the notification settings, including the type and frequency of alerts, and review the alert history for auditing purposes. This feature keeps admins informed about changes in user behavior that could impact their business. \nService Updates \n\u00a0 \nZoom Software Lifecycle Policy -\n We plan to enforce the next round of our Software Lifecycle Policy on November 2, 2024. Please check our \nsupport article\n\u00a0for the table of products and corresponding minimum versions. Users who are running an end-of-life version after November 2 will be logged out of their Zoom app (Desktop, Mobile, and VDI) or not be able to join meetings via the Zoom Client until they update. As always, we highly recommend you regularly download and update to the latest version of Zoom software by checking for updates within the Zoom app or by navigating to \nzoom.us/download\n\u00a0to take advantage of all our latest security and functionality features.\nHappy Zooming,\nZoom Success Advisor\n \n \n \n \n \n \nYou're receiving this email because you are a Zoom customer.\nIf you wish to be removed from our email list, \nunsubscribe\n or \nmanage your email preferences.",

    "body": "Dear Conner, Whether it's new products and features or courses that teach you to use Zoom better, we are constantly evolving to improve your experience. To help keep\n \n \nDear \nConner\n,\u00a0\n \nWhether it's new products and features or courses that teach you to use Zoom better, we are constantly evolving to improve your experience. To help keep you up to date, we have summarized some key new things you should know below. \nDownload\n the latest version of the Zoom desktop client to access all these features and more.\u00a0\n\u00a0\nThis is only a selection of the many updates happening on the Zoom platform, so to help you stay up to date, check out:\n\u00a0\nPreview notes\n \u2013 A list of upcoming features. This page is only available to Zoom account owners and admins; you must sign in to view them.\nRelease notes\n \u2013 A complete list of past releases across the Zoom platform.\u00a0\n\u00a0\nIf you have questions about the features and announcements outlined below, please reply directly to this email.\n\u00a0\n*Note: Some products and features may not be available to all customers.\n\u00a0\nNew Features\nIntroducing Zoom Docs -\n Zoom Docs allows users to collaborate and track projects easily and seamlessly. Users can draft, organize, and share materials and documents whether they are in a meeting or not. To make the most of their meetings, users can transform past and present meetings into actionable documents, wikis, and projects using Meeting AI templates. Zoom\u2019s AI Companion features further enhance efficiency by generating and translating content. While creating materials, users have access to basic editing tools, block actions, and various content types that can be added or embedded. In addition, documents can be shared directly with other users or through Team Chat channels. For more information, check out our \nguide to getting started with Zoom Docs.\n\u00a0\nEvents & Training\nWhat\u2019s New at Zoom Webinar\n\u00a0- \nRegister to join us for this monthly session on Oct. 3 at 8/11 am (PST/EST). You will have the chance to learn about new Zoom products and features and how they can help you improve collaboration, increase productivity, and maximize the value of Zoom.\u00a0 \nKey Highlights from Zoom\u2019s August Releases\n\u00a0\nZoom Workplace App\n Updates\n\u00a0\nMeeting features\nEnhanced sharing ability of pre-attached assets in meetings - Windows, macOS, Linux - \nUsers can effortlessly share pre-attached assets during meetings. This feature allows meeting participants to attach files in advance or reuse them for future meetings, enabling hosts and invitees to seamlessly integrate meeting assets into sessions. They can collaborate on a Whiteboard and open assets in separate tabs or native application windows, supporting various file types and cloud services for a streamlined sharing experience with minimal clicks.\n\u00a0\nWebinar features\nEnable or disable Watch Livestream link for overflow attendees - Windows, macOS, Linux -\n Hosts can enable or disable the Watch Livestream link on the overflow dialog for attendees during a meeting or a webinar session. When a meeting or webinar reaches capacity, attendees have the option to watch the livestream if the host has enabled this setting. The default setting will be changed to enabled, allowing overflow attendees to automatically access the livestream. Hosts can disable this option if they prefer not to redirect attendees to the livestream. This feature provides hosts greater control over the overflow experience for attendees, ensuring they can participate in the meeting or webinar presentation.\n\u00a0\nTeam Chat features\nPin Zoom Docs to Team Chat channel tabs - Windows, macOS, Linux, iOS, Android - \nTeam Chat users can now pin existing or create new Zoom Docs directly within a channel tab. Once pinned, the doc is accessible to all channel members and can be viewed in split view mode alongside the chat. Pinning a doc follows the same user permissions as adding channel tabs. This feature enhances productivity by enabling teams to seamlessly reference and work on documents together within their chat conversations.\n\u00a0\nMail and Calendar features\nAuto-reply drafting for email conversations - Windows, macOS - \nUsing the Email Compose with AI Companion, users can have email replies automatically drafted for them. When replying to an email, the AI Companion analyzes the full context of the previous messages in the conversation and generates a draft reply. This allows users to quickly review and send responses without manually providing context. The auto-reply drafting enhances productivity by saving time spent composing replies.\n\u00a0\nZoom Clips features\nSearch functionality for Zoom Clips transcripts - Windows, macOS, Linux, iOS, Android - \nUsers have the ability to search through the transcripts of their Zoom Clips recordings. By entering keywords or phrases, users can locate and navigate directly to relevant moments within a clip's transcript. This search functionality enables users to efficiently find and replay specific sections of interest within their recorded Zoom Clips content, enhancing the overall user experience.\n\u00a0\nZoom Web\n Updates\nEnhanced AI Companion Results with OCR and Chat Messages - \nZoom will be enhancing AI Companion results by incorporating screen shared content via optical character recognition (OCR) and in-meeting chat messages. This additional context allows AI Companion to create more accurate, reliable, and complete results. Administrators can manage these settings in Account Settings under the AI Companion tab in the web portal.\nAllow meeting hosts to retain and access meeting transcripts - \nAdministrators can choose to have meeting transcripts generated by Meeting Summary with AI Companion saved. Once saved, they are accessible by meeting hosts and can be downloaded as a VTT file from the list of available transcripts. These saved transcripts cannot be shared directly through Zoom. Hosts can also generate Zoom Docs from these meeting transcripts with Docs content generation and revision with AI Companion.\n\u00a0\nZoom Phone\n Updates\nOpt-in/opt-out APIs and webhooks for SMS - \nUsers can receive webhook events when an SMS recipient sends an opt-out to a Zoom Phone number. The event includes the recipient's phone number, timestamp, and the Zoom Phone number that received the opt-out. Users can also apply opt-in and opt-out rules for specific recipient contacts on Zoom Phone numbers via an API. This allows users to enforce opt-in and opt-out compliance rules across their organization programmatically.\nCall recording transcription available in multiple languages - \nAdditional languages are integrated across various Zoom Phone features. Users can select from a wider range of languages for call recording transcription, including Chinese (Simplified), Chinese (Traditional), German, French (France and Canada), Italian, Japanese, Korean, Portuguese, Russian, and Spanish (EU and US). This feature must be enabled by Zoom.\n\u00a0\nZoom Events & Sessions\n Updates\nSupport single-use webinars of up to 1 million participants - \nUsers can purchase a single-use webinar license for a webinar with up to 1 million participants. This option provides the flexibility to choose a plan that suits their event needs without any long-term commitments. The single-use license is applicable for a minimum of 10,000 attendees and will expire 3 months from the date of purchase.\nAutomatic browser-based event and session survey triggering - \nHosts can configure the ability to automatically have the event survey open in the attendee's browser when the event ends or when the attendee leaves the event. This functionality applies to single-session events (meetings and webinars) and recurring events. Multi-session events are not covered at this time.\nWatch Zoom Events recording playback with AI-powered smart chapters - \nHosts can provide an enhanced recording playback experience for attendees in the event lobby by integrating AI-powered smart chapters. Attendees can navigate through longer recordings using automatically generated smart chapters that provide an overview of the content. The recording player incorporates smart chapters if the feature is enabled on the account.\n\u00a0\nZoom Revenue Accelerator\n Updates\nAutomated scorecards evaluate sales interactions - \nAutomated scorecards provide a baseline score and leverage AI to evaluate sales conversations and interactions. Sales leaders can filter through certain sales methodologies, select from pre-set questions, and view scorecard analytics for only automated scorecards or manual scorecards. Account owners and admins can build scorecards with custom criteria and have an AI model automatically score conversations based on those metrics. The automated evaluations provide sales leaders and admins with feedback on areas of strength and improvement. This feature evaluates more conversations and gains insights into overall sales performance trends.\u00a0\nNote: Automatic scorecards without an overall score will be omitted from the analytics charting.\nView Coaching Activity Tracker for sales leaders -\n Zoom Revenue Accelerator's Coaching Activity Tracker allows sales leaders to quickly understand what managers are coaching their teams and the last time that they coached them. Sales leaders can access a unified coaching metrics dashboard that provides a hierarchical, organizational view as well as a team-specific view of coaching activities. The dashboard offers clear visibility into the number of calls invited, joined, listened to, scored, and commented on during a given period. Intuitive filter selections and consistency between the team-specific and roll-up hierarchical views are included.\nSupport for additional languages - \nZoom Revenue Accelerator (ZRA) supports additional languages, enhancing the overall user experience. The new supported languages include Romanian, Turkish, Thai, Czech, Estonian, Hungarian, and Malay. Users can easily switch between languages within the ZRA interface, allowing seamless communication and collaboration across diverse teams and regions. This expanded language support empowers users to utilize ZRA's features while working in their preferred language.\n\u00a0\nZoom Contact Center\n Updates\nSave SMS conversation transcripts in CRM systems - \nAdmins can enable or disable the automatic saving of SMS transcripts within the CRM systems, such as Zendesk, Salesforce, ServiceNow, and MS Dynamics 365. When enabled, agents using CTI connector can review the full context of their SMS interactions with customers within the CRM. The transcript is formatted with participant names, timestamps, and captioned text, and includes any attachments like files or images. Personally identifiable information (PII) can be redacted from the transcripts based on admin preferences.\nOutbound (1-1) email engagements for agents - \nAgents and supervisors can initiate outbound (1-1) email engagements with consumers. They can search and select a contact from the address book or manually enter an email address. Agents can select a configured From email account and associate the outbound email with a queue. Supervisors can view the engagement direction as Outbound in the engagements tab. Agents cannot send emails to unsubscribed consumers.\nConsumer engagement history across channels - \nAgents and supervisors can view the engagement history for consumers for multiple channels, including email, authenticated messaging, and social media. The engagement history is linked based on the consumer's unique identifier, such as email address, authenticated consumer ID, or social media ID. Agents and supervisors can access key details like engagement duration, events, assigned agent, notes, and conversation summary. This allows agents to better understand the consumer's journey and provide personalized service.\n\u00a0\nZoom Virtual Agent\n Updates\nRetrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) answer generation - \nAdmins can leverage RAG Answer Generation for more accurate and contextual responses to customer inquiries. This feature integrates the customer-approved knowledge base content with a Large Language Model (LLM) to create conversational answers. The LLM generates intelligent responses by referencing content from knowledge base sources, striking a balance between AI-driven intelligence and admin-controlled source material. This approach ensures that answers are both contextually relevant and grounded in approved information. Admins have the flexibility to enable this feature at the bot level by opting in to Answer Generation, giving them control over when and how this advanced capability is utilized.\n\u00a0\nZoom Whiteboard\n Updates\nAbility to restrict external link sharing for Zoom Whiteboard - \nAdmins can disable external link sharing within their organization. If the Allow external link sharing checkbox is unchecked in the admin portal under the Sharing section, the option Anyone can access is disabled in the share sheet. A tooltip displays \"Your admin has disabled this function\" when users attempt to share a link externally. This feature gives admins more control over external collaboration while still allowing external users to be invited.\nRestrict viewer actions on shared whiteboards - \nOwners and co-owners can restrict viewers from exporting, duplicating, downloading content, or making templates from their whiteboards. By default, all actions are enabled for viewers. Owners can choose whether the restrictions apply to all viewers or only external viewers. This feature gives document owners greater control over how their whiteboards are accessed and used by viewers.\n\u00a0\nZoom Scheduler\n Updates\nSupport Webhooks for API - \nWith Webhooks for API, Zoom Scheduler users can integrate different systems and automate workflows, enabling admins to authorize third parties to trigger actions during the booking process.\n\u00a0\nService Updates\n\u00a0\nZoom Software Lifecycle Policy - \nWe plan to enforce the next round of our Software Lifecycle Policy on November 2, 2024. Please check our \nsupport article\n for the table of products and corresponding minimum versions. Users who are running an end-of-life version after November 2 will be logged out of their Zoom app (Desktop, Mobile, and VDI) or not be able to join meetings via the Zoom Client until they update. As always, we highly recommend you regularly download and update to the latest version of Zoom software by checking for updates within the Zoom app or by navigating to \nzoom.us/download\n to take advantage of all our latest security and functionality features.\nHappy Zooming,\nZoom Success Advisor\n \n \n \n \n \n \nYou're receiving this email because you are a Zoom customer.\nIf you wish to be removed from our email list, \nunsubscribe\n or \nmanage your email preferences.",

    "body": "Dear \nConner\n,\u00a0\n \nWhether it's new products and features or courses that teach you to use Zoom better, we are constantly evolving to improve your experience. To help keep you up to date, we have summarized some key new things you should know below. \nDownload\n\u00a0the latest version of the Zoom desktop client to access all these features and more.\u00a0\nThis is only a selection of the many updates happening on the Zoom platform, so to help you stay up to date, check out: \nPreview notes\n \u2013 A list of upcoming features. This page is only available to Zoom account owners and admins; you must sign in to view them.\nRelease notes\n \u2013 A complete list of past releases across the Zoom platform.\u00a0\nIf you have questions about the features and announcements outlined below, please reply directly to this email.\n*Note: Some products and features may not be available to all customers.\n\u00a0\nBusiness Updates\n\u00a0\nIntroducing Zoom Workflow Automation -\n Users can create and configure automated workflows across Team Chat, Zoom services, and third-party applications. This feature allows users to define a sequence of steps and actions to automate processes, enhancing productivity and efficiency. Account admins can \nenable workflow automation\n\u00a0either at the account level or for specific user groups. Enabling it at the account level allows all users to create automations, while enabling it at the user group level restricts this capability to users within those groups. Regardless of who can create automations, all users can view and interact with automations created by authorized users. Learn more about \nusing workflow automation\n.\nSmart Name Tags now available in Zoom Rooms -\n Smart name tags leverage AI to apply name tags to people in a Zoom Room, making it easier for other participants in the meeting to know who is in the room, regardless of whether or not someone is speaking. There are two modes to smart name tags: manual and automatic. Manual displays a generic name tag that can be edited. This can be edited on the Zoom Rooms Controller. Once the automatic smart name tags feature is enabled by the admin, users can consent and enroll by uploading an image of themselves through their profile. This will allow their name tag to be displayed automatically in the video from the Zoom Room in which they appear. This automatic smart name tag can also be edited if needed. Features like these can help make meetings more inclusive and productive, and enable Zoom Rooms participants to be recognized more easily in their meetings. Admins must enable this feature. \nLearn more here\n.\nUpcoming changes to Zoom release notes -\n Starting August 30, 2024, we are enhancing how we publish release notes to simplify the structure and improve readability. In some cases, you may need to subscribe to new articles in order to continue receiving updates about releases. For detailed information, please visit the \nupcoming changes to Zoom release notes support page\n.\u00a0\u00a0\nEvents & Training\n\u00a0\nWhat\u2019s New at Zoom Webinar - \nRegister to join us\n for this monthly session on Aug. 29 at 8/11 am (PST/EST).

If you post a question, you may just hear from one of our community champions like Denise! Meet Denise and learn more about the Community Champions program in our \nrecent post\n! \nKey Highlights from Zoom\u2019s July Releases\n\u00a0\nZoom Workplace App\n Updates\n\u00a0\nMeeting Features\n\u00a0\nZoom AI Companion universal toggle for easy enablement - \nWindows, macOS, Linux - Account owners and admins of Zoom Workplace Pro accounts can enable several AI Companion features with a single click within the Workplace app and Web Portal settings. The single AI Companion admin setting will be available within the Workplace desktop app settings and Zoom Web Portal account settings. Users in the account still will be in control of when AI Companion gets used. \nMail and Calendar Features\n\u00a0\nZoom Calendar advanced room support -\n Windows, macOS - Users can access Zoom Rooms details, including their location and maximum capacity. They can find their frequently used rooms for quick rebooking, alongside a list of recommended and available room options. The enhanced filtering options allow users to refine their search further, filtering rooms based on floor level, maximum capacity, and location parameters such as site, state, or city. This feature must be enabled by Zoom. \nPhone Features\n \n\u00a0\nCall recording transcription available in multiple languages -\n Windows, macOS, Linux, iOS, Android - Additional languages are integrated across various Zoom Phone features. Users can select from a wider range of languages for call recording transcription, including Chinese (Simplified), Chinese (Traditional), German, French (France and Canada), Italian, Japanese, Korean, Portuguese, Russian, and Spanish (EU and US). This feature must be enabled by Zoom. \nZoom Web\n Updates\n\u00a0\nEnhancements to external user dashboard - \nThe External Connections dashboard in the admin portal (ADMIN > Team Chat Management > External Connections) has been updated to not only show external users in my account, but also to show my users in externally owned accounts. This provides admins with better visibility into all external collaborations. Additionally, all approval requests have been combined into one tab to make admin approvals easier. \nZoom Events\n Updates\n\u00a0\nC\nustom query builder for cross-event analytics - \nHosts can build custom queries to analyze data across multiple events and sessions. They can specify the data points to include, apply filters, and define the output format. The query results are stored securely and can be accessed later without caching in memory, ensuring efficient data management and analysis. This feature enables comprehensive cross-event analytics. \nIntroducing Page Builder -\n Hosts can create custom registration pages for Zoom Events that match their brand and meet the unique needs of their event using a new drag-and-drop page builder. The page builder allows customizing the layout and components on registration pages. Registration pages will automatically inherit event branding, styling, and native components. Each content component supports the drag-and-drop function, the \nDuplicate\n button, the \nDelete\n button, the Text Spacer component, and the Button Divider component. \n\u00a0\nZoom Rooms\n Updates\n\u00a0\nAI Companion enhancements - \nWin, Mac, Appliances, iPad zr, iOS zrc, Android zrc, Win zrc, Web zrc - AI Companion has received several enhancements. Meeting Summary and Meeting Questions are now both enabled or disabled in tandem when AI Companion is toggled on or off from the Zoom Rooms controller. In addition, users in the Zoom Room can choose to delete all meeting assets saved by AI Companion when it is disabled from the Zoom Rooms controller. Lastly, users can receive or send requests to enable AI Companion while in a Zoom meeting. \nZoom Workspace Reservation\n Updates\n\u00a0\nReserve rooms through Google Calendar integration - \nUsers can reserve rooms directly in Zoom for the Google Workspace add-on when creating or editing calendar events. Account owners and admins will need to enable the Workspace Reservation portion of this add-in. \nZoom Contact Center\n Updates\n\u00a0\nExplicit no-consent/do not record option for voice recording - \nConsumers can explicitly opt out of voice call recording by selecting a Do Not Record option when asked for recording consent during a voice engagement. Admins can configure the Do Not Record prompt and enable/disable this option at the account or queue level. The new queue logic (if enabled) checks the engagement's RecordingConsent variable value and acts accordingly, skipping recording prompts, disabling recording controls for agents, and not recording the call if Do Not Record is selected. This provides consumers with additional consent options so their choice is honored throughout the engagement. This feature is also supported in the CTI connector.\n \nEnhancements to AI model selection for AI features - \nAccount owners and admins can opt out of using third-party AI models for Zoom Contact Center's AI Companion and AI Expert Assist features. This provides an alternative to the third-party AI models currently used, addressing concerns around data security, regulatory compliance, and availability across regions. This option gives customers greater control over their data and AI model usage. This feature must be enabled by Zoom. Note: Unavailable features at launch: AI Companion's Follow-up tasks and AI Expert Assist's Auto disposition.\nZoom Virtual Agent\n Updates\n\u00a0\nAuto-coach management -\n Admins can access a centralized auto-coaching dashboard to review and manage all intents with GenAI-added training phrases from a single location. They can control the number of auto-added training phrases to each intent model. Additionally, a new icon identifies intents with auto-added training phrases for easy recognition. The auto-suggestion logic has been improved to display new suggestions only after admins make changes to at least one suggestion, providing better control over the auto-coaching process.\n \nZoom Workforce Management\n Updates\n\u00a0\nMessaging channel support for Zoom Workforce Management -\n Zoom Workforce Management now supports the unified messaging channel that combines chat and SMS used by Zoom Contact Center. Users can create queues and service groups for the messaging channel. They can also import historical messaging data for forecasting and reporting purposes. This enables Contact Centers to optimize their workforce and provide a smooth experience across multiple channels.\n \nActivity notes for Zoom Workforce Management schedule -\n When creating activities and assigning them to agents' schedules, supervisors and admins can now include notes. These notes are accessible by clicking on the activity in the schedules view, with an indicator showing the presence of a note. Notes can include Zoom meeting links or other relevant information. Agents can also view notes for activities on their individual schedules. This enhancement improves transparency and provides additional context for scheduled activities.\n \nService Updates\n\u00a0\nZoom Software Lifecycle Policy -\n We plan to enforce the next round of our Software Lifecycle Policy on November 2, 2024. Please check our \nsupport article\n for the table of products and corresponding minimum versions. Users who are running an end-of-life version after November 2 will be logged out of their Zoom app (Desktop, Mobile, and VDI) or not be able to join meetings via the Zoom Client until they update. As always, we highly recommend you regularly download and update to the latest version of Zoom software by checking for updates within the Zoom app or by navigating to\u00a0\nzoom.com/download\n to take advantage of all our latest security and functionality features.\n \nHappy Zooming,\nZoom Success Advisor\n \n \n \n \n \n \nYou're receiving this email because you are a Zoom customer.\nIf you wish to be removed from our email list, \nunsubscribe\n or \nmanage your email preferences.",

    "subject": "From Day One: Your Gig Workers Want a Little Respect",
    "body": "Corporate America, the gig workers who keep your businesses operating have some feedback for you. As the popularity of independent work increases, so does employer dependence on contractors, freelancers, and other contingent workers. In a McKinsey survey in 2022, \n36% of employed respondents\n, equivalent to about 58 million workers, identified as independent workers, up from 27% just six years earlier. The recruiting platform \nMBO Partners estimates the number is closer to 45%\n as of last year. Independent workers are the people who deliver your lunch, drive you to the airport, build your houses, write your blog posts, design your websites, produce your podcasts, tutor your kids, and market your products to the public.\u00a0\n\u00a0\nAmong the changes to our working lives brought about by the pandemic is the preference\u2013and often the need\u2013for non-standard work arrangements. In fields where employment is precarious, gig work can cover the gaps in a pinch or when the bottom falls out. The popularity of flexible, autonomous, asynchronous, and project-based work remains with us long after Covid has subsided.\n\u00a0\nMany who work as contractors are attracted to \nthe autonomy and flexibility this working style affords\n. Especially for family caretakers, who are disproportionately female, freelance and contract work allows them to \nearn an income while meeting caregiving obligations\n. Plenty are drawn to the work out of necessity, bringing in extra money to fill the gaps or to maintain an income when a full-time job can\u2019t be found.\n\u00a0\nEven so, \ngig work has been associated with high rates of anxiety\n because of its unpredictability and instability, and because gig workers shoulder the burden of benefits typically provided by the employer, like health insurance and paid leave.\nC. Crockford is a Philadelphia-based freelance writer and editor who has experienced both the promise and peril of gig work over the last decade. When editorial work doesn\u2019t cover expenses, he uses apps like Amazon Flex, TaskRabbit, and Fiverr to pick up moving gigs, cleaning gigs, the odd retail shift, and courier work. \u201cThe upsides of that are it is easy to find work if you\u2019re just hustling, but it does depend on who\u2019s posting and what\u2019s available,\u201d he told From Day One contributing editor Emily McCrary-Ruiz-Esparza.\nAnother point of stress: Gig workers seldom get employee-benefits support from the apps they use unless they meet a specific number of hours, thresholds that Crockford feels are unrealistic. \u201cThey offer benefits, but only if you work a certain amount of hours a month, and they know that you\u2019re not going to make those hours,\u201d he said. The relationship between worker and platform is often mercenary and transactional.\n\u00a0\nThe Effects of Misclassifying Contact Workers\n\u00a0\nNot only are freelancers susceptible to the whims of the business cycle, they\u2019re not undergirded by the same rights that full-time permanent employees enjoy. \nSome are paid subminimum wages\n and treated like permanent employees without the requisite benefits and support, a practice known as misclassification. Crockford pointed out that the benefit of quick payment is sometimes undercut by how low the compensation can be. He\u2019s gone out for some jobs that pay just above the local minimum wage.\n\u00a0\nThe workers don\u2019t qualify for basics like health insurance, 401(k)s, and paid leave, and also miss out on smaller perks\u2013like transportation subsidies or career-development training\u2013nor are they included in many of the changes brought about by employers prioritizing diversity, equity, inclusion, and belonging.\n\u00a0\n\u201cNot only are they left out of programming when it comes to DEIB work\u2013being able to attend training and that sort of thing\u2013but they\u2019re also left out of having a voice around their experience,\u201d Rachel Marcuse, said chief operating officer and managing partner at DEI consulting firm \nReadySet\n.\u00a0\n\u00a0\nHow to Be Better to Your Contractors and Freelancers\n\u00a0\nContract workers and their advocates want two things: Respect for their boundaries and on-time payment. Leslie Lejano, a Los Angeles\u2013based freelance PR and communications consultant, asserts that a good client is one that treats her as a collaborator, not an order-taker. \u201cThey\u2019re hiring me because they trust me. They value my services. They understand the value that I provide,\u201d she told From Day One. \u201cIt\u2019s very much like a partnership. I really value a client that gives me enough to work with, but also trusts that I have a vision.\u201d\n\u00a0\nAnd be aware of \u201cscope creep,\u201d which is when a client demands tasks outside of the agreed-to scope of work, often incrementally. It\u2019s a violation of the contract, and it\u2019s a harbinger of a relationship with poor boundaries, contractors say.\u00a0\nThe most common problem that the \nFreelancers Union\n, a nonprofit advocacy group, hears from its members is late payment, or even non-payment. In fact, the union \u201cpolled freelancers and found that 76% every year go either unpaid or not paid on time by a client,\u201d according to Espinal. \nRead the full story here\n to learn more about being better to contractors and freelancers.\n\u00a0 \nNEWS\n\u00a0 \nIn Women\u2019s Health, a New Coalition Aims to Keep Up the Progress: \nWomen\u2019s health care, long neglected by medical researchers and tech innovators in the U.S., is starting to get its due. A new coalition of digital health companies aims to harness the energy around women\u2019s health to boost the accessibility and affordability of their care by working with employers to improve corporate benefits and workplace support. The group, called the \nWomen\u2019s Health Coalition for Digital Solutions\n, combines the mental-health platform \nTalkspace\n and the family-health company \nOvia Health\n with startups aimed at everything from fertility to menopause to nutrition and fitness. In its first year, the collective is focused on awareness and de-stigmatization efforts as well as using its members\u2019 influence to advocate for workplace health equity. In future years, the coalition\u2019s founders say they\u2019d like to encourage more investment in women\u2019s health technology and enhance the patient experience by exploring integration among their many services. \nRead the full story here.\n\u00a0\n\u00a0 \nLIVE EVENT HIGHLIGHTS\n\u00a0 \nThe Role of Leadership in Promoting Workplace Belonging:\n Here\u2019s a unique twist on workplace belonging: a veterans Employee Resource Group (ERG) collaborated with a local Nashville nonprofit, where the veterans shared their personal stories, which musicians then turned into songs. \u201cThis initiative was incredibly successful,\u201d said Michal Alter, co-founder and CEO of Visit.org, during a panel discussion at \nFrom Day One\u2019s Manhattan conference\n. The veterans\u2019 songs resonated so deeply within their company that the CEO invited the musicians to perform at a major town hall event. \u201cThese employees were celebrated and thanked for their service. This emotional connection is what we aim to create, and we love seeing these heartwarming stories,\u201d said Alter. \nRead the full story here.\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\nLeading the Next Generation in the Sports Business: \nWith their run to the Western Conference championship series, the Minnesota Timberwolves showed basketball fans a lot this year. And their success is due in no small part to the minds in the front office. One member supporting their success is Sianneh Mulbah, chief people officer for the \nTimberwolves\n and \nLynx\n. During a fireside chat at \nFrom Day One\u2019s Minneapolis conference\n, Mulbah spoke about the rewards and challenges of HR work in the world of professional sports. With two decades of HR experience, she leads the strategic direction and execution of the team\u2019s people-related functions. In a business that has long been male-dominated, she noted, the Wolves leadership is 50% female. \nRead the full story here.\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\nHow Employers Are Boosting Internal Mobility and Career Development:\n Developing talent from within a company\u2019s ranks simply makes a lot of sense. But as with all corporate practices, how a company puts an idea into practice makes a difference. At the\n Manhattan conference\n, a panel of leaders shared the thoughtful and effective ways their organizations are successfully promoting employees. At Visa, the message that career development is a priority comes from the top, says Melissa Fridman, head of people and global merchant sales and acquiring at \nVisa North America\n. Ryan McInerney ascended to CEO of the company in 2023, after being prepared for this transition for two years, Fridman says. One of his first actions in the role was promoting others into leadership roles, which reinforced the message of strong career mobility throughout the company. \nRead the full story here.\n\u00a0\n\u00a0 \nVIRTUAL EVENT HIGHLIGHTS\n\u00a0 \nUsing Innovative Technology and AI to Revolutionize Hiring for Top Talent: \nLike many companies, \nMGM Resorts\n has been undergoing a talent acquisition transformation over the past few years. \u201cWe\u2019re enacting a strategic way for recruiters to evolve into more of an advisor role,\u201d said Justin Fronberg, the company\u2019s executive director of talent acquisition. Fronberg spoke in an executive panel discussion about \u201cUsing Innovative Technology and AI to Revolutionize Hiring for Top Talent,\u201d during \nFrom Day One\u2019s June virtual conference\n. \u201cWhat\u2019s been critical for us is to relieve them of the transactional aspects of the position,\u201d he said. One way to accomplish this is using AI chatbots, which create efficiencies for recruiters and job candidates alike. \nRead the full story here.\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\nMaking All Paths to Parenthood More Inclusive For Your Employees: \nAt outdoor sports company \nWoodward\n, the VP of talent and culture, Dan Kwong, is just getting started with developing the company\u2019s family-support benefits. He\u2019s beginning with the basics: nailing down an employer value proposition to guide the choices he will make and affirming current benefits, like paid parental leave. Perhaps most importantly, Kwong is taking his time to figure out what the workforce needs with two questions. First, \u201cWhat are the key demographics of the talent pools that we currently attract, and that we want to attract?\u201d Second, \u201cWhat are the needs of each talent pool? We assume we know what people want and need. Sometimes we\u2019re wrong.\u201d Kwong was a part of a panel of talent and benefits leaders for a \nFrom Day One webinar\n about strategies for identifying workforce needs and how to design a package that is as inclusive as possible. \nRead the full story here.\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\nTaking a Well-Considered Approach to Adopting New Technologies: \nVolume, timeliness, quality, and cost. These are the four key performance indicators when it comes to talent acquisition, according to Tim Wesson, SVP, global talent acquisition at \nIQVIA\n, which conducts clinical research in the healthcare field. While those will likely stay the same, what keeps changing is the technology surrounding it. \u201cWe can be much more efficient and much more effective in the way we go about meeting those success criteria,\u201d Wesson told moderator Nicole Smith of Harvard Business Review during a fireside chat at the \nJune virtual conference\n. \u201cI think the measurements of success can change over time,\u201d Wesson added. \u201cAs trends evolve, like focusing on skills-based hiring or internal talent development, the success metrics may shift accordingly.\u201d That\u2019s why being adaptable is so key. \nRead the full story here.\n\u00a0\n\u00a0 \nQUICK HITS\n\u00a0 \nAmerica\u2019s HR Lobby Drops the \u2018E\u2019 From DEI: \nThe country\u2019s top organization for HRs professionals is distancing itself from the \u201cequity\u201d plank of diversity, equity and inclusion, or DEI. SHRM, a lobbying and advocacy group with 340,000 members, announced that it wants employers to focus on inclusion and diversity efforts\u2014in that order. The group, a powerful lobby in Washington, said that it\u2019s moving away from equity language to ensure no group of workers appears to get preferential treatment, reports the Wall Street Journal. Equity, in HR parlance, is the notion that companies should take steps to level the playing field for workers. \u201cBy emphasizing inclusion-first, we aim to address the current shortcomings of DE&I programs, which have led to societal backlash,\u201d the group said in a statement posted on LinkedIn, where it drew many critical comments. Zachary Temple, a senior HR executive at KeyBank in Cleveland, accused the group of \u201ckowtowing to political adversity.\u201d \nRead the full story here.\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\nEmployees With Autism Find New Ways to Navigate the Workplace:\n When Chelsia Potts took her 10-year-old daughter to a psychologist to be tested for autism spectrum disorder, she decided almost as an afterthought to be tested herself. The result came as a surprise. Like her daughter, Potts was diagnosed with autism. Potts, 35, had thought she might have anxiety or some other issue. A first-generation college student, she had earned a doctor of education degree and risen through academia to become a high-level administrator at Miami University in Oxford, Ohio. But after her visit to the psychologist, she had to figure out how her diagnosis would affect her work life, reports the New York Times. \u201cInitially, I was confused, and I did keep it to myself,\u201d she said. \u201cI had a picture of what someone with autism looked like, and that did not look like me.\u201d \nRead the full story here.\n\u00a0\nThree Ways to Compassionately Hold Your Team Accountable: \nLeaders have always had to balance compassion and accountability\u2014and in recent years, we\u2019ve seen the pendulum swing wildly in both directions. During the early years of the pandemic, many organizations made their people a priority, offering flexibility, mental health benefits, and other support to help employees navigate a stressful time. Recently, as interest rates and inflation have risen, we\u2019ve seen leaders change their tune, dialing back on some benefits, bringing people back to the office, and placing more emphasis on results: meeting deadlines, hitting targets, and growing revenues, as reported by the Harvard Business Review. This situation has left employees, managers, and executives wondering: Is it possible to create accountability without the whiplash, in a way that makes people feel like their needs still matter? \nRead the full story here.\n\u00a0\n\u00a0 \nSPONSOR SPOTLIGHT:\nAARP\n\u00a0 \nWhat a Five-Generation Workforce Means for You: The Myths and Realities:\u00a0\nNick, a senior manager in a global tech company based in Seattle, has worked with people of many different ages, both older and younger than him. His experience is increasingly typical in a workforce that spans five generations, a growing diversity of experience that provides the benefit of workers sharing wisdom across the ages, but also gives rise to problems like ageism\u2013the bias against others based merely on their calendar age. Nick recently learned that one of his direct reports is notably older than Nick assumed. \u201cAt that moment, I realized that I had been thinking of him as less serious and more in need of guidance. I knew I had to examine my prejudices about age.\u201d This is the first time in history that such a rich mixture of people from their teens to their 80s are at work. In 2020, \na Deloitte white paper\n reported that 70% of executives surveyed believed a multigenerational workforce was important for their organizations, but only 10% felt ready to lead one and understood how it might affect operations. \nRead the full story here.\n\u00a0\n\u00a0 \nSPONSOR SPOTLIGHT:\nVISIER\n\u00a0 \nThe Future of People Analytics Opens Data Science to Everyone: \nWhere HR was in the past called upon for arithmetical facts about the workforce and its makeup, the department\u2019s new position of influence now puts it on the hook to answer qualitative questions about the state of the workforce and the future of the business. But without quantitative backing, those answers are, at best, guesswork made in good faith. \nSHRM found in 2021\n that HR teams using people analytics report achieving their DEI and retention goals and being more competitive for talent. But people analytics platform \nVisier\n estimates that people operations teams still spend about 70% of their time on foundational analytics, that is, figures like headcount, turnover, and diverse representation. But as HR is \nincreasingly called upon to be a strategic contributor to the business\n, the team needs to satisfy complicated concerns, like, \nAre we underpaying in our industry? Who\u2019s most at risk for leaving the company? And how can we keep them? \nFrom Day One spoke with Visier\u2019s VP of product management, Ian Cook, about HR\u2019s move from counting workers to needing a PhD on the team just to answer business questions. \nRead the full story here.\n\u00a0\n\u00a0 \nSPONSOR SPOTLIGHT:\nUNITED MINDS\n\u00a0 \nEmployees Rising: 10 Years Later:\n It's been a decade since \nUnited Minds\n, a global consulting firm focused on making business more human, conducted a groundbreaking study that unveiled a pivotal trend in brand reputation: employees were\u2013unprompted\u2013advocating on behalf of their companies on their nascent social media platforms. This launched a fascinating and previously unseen dynamic in the employee-employer relationship. Fast forward to 2024, United Minds checked back in on the state of employee experience by surveying employees across 14 countries spanning six continents, asking many of the same questions in order to assess change and progress. The big takeaway? Over the past decade, despite significant volatility, employee satisfaction, across many metrics, has improved. There\u2019s more to it, though, as employee expectations have also increased. While more people are going above and beyond at work, more are also open to new opportunities and fewer are advocating for their employer. The tipping point will come.

These dedicated individuals are our Zoom Community Champions!\u00a0 The Zoom Community Champion Program was designed to recognize and honor the exceptional efforts of our community's Zoom experts. Check out our \nrecent post\n\u00a0to meet one of our dedicated Community Champions! \nKey Highlights from Zoom\u2019s June Releases \nZoom Workplace App\n\u00a0Updates \nZoom app ability to update while application is not running (Windows) -\n To provide a more seamless meeting experience, reducing disruptions and missed call minutes caused by forced updates before joining a meeting, the Zoom desktop app for Windows (.exe package) can push version upgrades while the app is not running for users with \nauto updates enabled\n. \nSupport keyboard shortcuts for in-meeting reactions (Meeting/Webinar - Windows, macOS) -\n Users that rely on accessibility features currently face challenges accessing in-meeting reactions due to the extensive tabbing required. To address this, new keyboard shortcuts will be introduced to enable quicker and more efficient submission of reactions, facilitating timely and appropriate participation in call-and-response or voting activities. This improvement aims to provide a seamless experience for accessibility users, allowing them to give instant feedback without delays. Please see the \nrelease notes\n\u00a0for a list of keyboard shortcuts in this release.\u00a0 \nSupport for Zoom Clips (Linux, Android, iOS) -\n In addition to Windows and macOS, Zoom Clips will be available for Linux, Android, and iOS. Zoom Clips offers a convenient solution for capturing both personal video and screen activities, allowing users to effortlessly share their recordings with others. This feature is particularly valuable when demonstrating product features or showcasing various functionalities. Users can conveniently access their Clips through their client or web portal, and receive notifications about views, comments, and replies related to their Clips. The feature can be enabled or disabled at the account, group, or user level and is available for public beta during this release. \nZoom Web\n\u00a0Updates \nCustomer Managed Key fallback capabilities for enhanced data security -\n Account owners and admins can enable the Automatic fallback to Zoom's key settings from the Web portal to address data loss concerns when the key broker service is unavailable. This enhancement allows Zoom services to utilize a Zoom-provided fallback key if the customer's key cannot be accessed, ensuring recordings can still be securely stored. Administrators will be notified based on new rules in the \"Fallback Status\" notification module, and new customers will have the fallback feature enabled by default, with warnings provided if they choose to disable it due to potential data loss risks. Additionally, cloud meeting recordings will default to local recording if a key cannot be obtained, offering a robust fallback solution. \nZoom Team Chat\n\u00a0Updates \nIntroducing Global Search ( Zoom desktop client and mobile app version 6.0.10 - Windows, macOS) -\n Global Search is an innovative feature designed to streamline information retrieval across all Zoom Workplace apps. By offering comprehensive search functionality, users can effortlessly locate data from meetings, chats, whiteboards, SMS, notes, and more, enhancing productivity and efficiency. This feature is enabled by default, and currently available for desktop clients on macOS and Windows. \nZoom Phone\n\u00a0Updates \nEnhanced call logs and reporting for Zoom Phone and Zoom Contact Center integration\n\u00a0-\n Account owners and admins can view detailed call logs and reports for calls transferred between Zoom Phone and Zoom Contact Center. The call logs display information such as the call path, extension types, and number formats for both Zoom Phone and Zoom Contact Center. Admins can filter and export call logs based on specific criteria. This feature provides a comprehensive view of the integration between Zoom Phone and Zoom Contact Center, enabling better monitoring and analysis of call routing. \nEnable or disable the Monitoring setting\n\u00a0-\n Account owners and admins can enable or disable the Monitoring setting in the Zoom web portal. This setting is generally available and enabled by default at the account level. When enabled, this feature allows users to listen, whisper, barge, or take over calls from other users, common areas, call queues, and shared line groups. \nZoom Revenue Accelerator\n\u00a0Updates \nOutreach integration general availability -\n Users can integrate Zoom Revenue Accelerator (ZRA) with Outreach for call recording and analysis. Inbound and outbound calls tracked in Outreach are automatically recorded and transcribed by ZRA. Additionally, users can push call analytics from ZRA, such as talk ratios and conversation topics, back to Outreach as activities. This integration enables users to gain valuable insights from their Outreach calls and incorporate them into their sales processes. \nUse the side panel for an overview of conversations -\n When sales leaders click a conversation from the Conversations tab, they use the side panel to extract insights from recordings and decide what conversations to review. This side panel displays key information, such as meeting metadata, meeting participants, meeting summary, and meeting next steps. Previously, sales leaders would use multiple clicks and switch between the Conversations tab list and Conversations details page. \nZoom Recorder for Microsoft Teams and external Zoom meetings -\n Account owners and admins can configure Zoom Revenue Accelerator to record Microsoft Teams meetings or Zoom meetings hosted by external parties. Meeting participants will be automatically notified and meeting recordings will be processed and analyzed by Zoom Revenue Accelerator (ZRA). Users can invite ZRA to record their meetings manually or automatically via their integrated calendar when hosting or participating in eligible meetings. The integration requires completed actions from both account administrators and end users for calendar synchronization. Note: This feature must be enabled by Zoom.\nZoom Virtual Agent\n\u00a0Updates\u00a0 \nRole-based permissions for Zoom Virtual Agent -\n Account owners and admins can set granular permissions for different roles to access various components of Zoom Virtual Agent such as chatbots, intent management, knowledge base, and integrations. Admins can specify view-only or edit permissions for each role for secure access and adherence to the principle of least privilege. These granular permissions also extend to the Operational Portal (OP) to support engineers troubleshooting customer accounts. \nSecure email validation with OTP - \nAccount owners and admins can validate the consumer's email address by sending a one-time password (OTP) to the provided email. The OTP is dynamically inserted into a fixed email template and sent to the user. Users have the option to type or paste the received OTP code, and regenerate the code if needed (maximum of 3 attempts). If the authentication is successful, users can proceed to the next step. If authentication fails after the maximum number of retries, the flow exits. This feature helps ensure the email address belongs to the intended user, enhancing security and user experience. This feature must be enabled by Zoom. \nZoom Contact Center\n\u00a0Updates \nReal-time guidance for agents with Next Best Action recommendations\n\u00a0- \nZoom Contact Center is introducing the Next Best Action feature, an AI-powered capability that provides agents with personalized, real-time recommendations based on customer context during interactions. Admins can configure rules to trigger actions based on intents and variables. Next Best Action recommendations aim to guide inexperienced agents towards desired outcomes and improved customer experiences. \nErase personal information from email transcripts -\n Account owners and admins can now redact personal data from email engagement transcripts on demand. The Erase Personal Information function has been extended to support the email channel, allowing admins to remove consumer PII from email logs. This feature enables brands to meet regulatory requirements for data privacy and fulfill consumer requests to have their personal information erased from internal systems after an engagement is completed. \nAutomatic message translation for multilingual support - \nAgents can automatically translate inbound messages to their preferred language and outbound messages to the consumer's preferred language. Account owners and admins can enable or disable this feature at the account and queue levels under AI Expert Assist settings. This enhances multilingual support and improves the overall customer experience. \nSMS support for UK and Ireland numbers -\n Users can purchase and use SMS-enabled mobile phone numbers in the United Kingdom and Ireland with Zoom Contact Center. Admins can submit required KYC documents before activating these numbers for use. They can view assigned and unassigned SMS-enabled numbers in the admin portal, which are clearly differentiated from other number types. Voice calls to these numbers receive a prompt stating that voice is not supported. Agents can send and receive SMS messages to and from UK and Ireland numbers using the Zoom client. This feature expands Zoom Contact Center's global reach and meets customer demand for SMS capabilities in Europe. \nWorkforce Management\n\u00a0Updates \nAgent portal for Zoom Workforce Management -\n Workforce Management admins and supervisors can view a listing of all agents working in Zoom Workforce Management, along with their details such as supervisor group, shift template assigned, vacation data, and adherence score. They can click into each agent to see their contact information from their Zoom profile, notification email and SMS contact details, and personal calendar with their work schedule. They can also filter agents by supervisor group or shift template name, and search for agents by name. This provides a central location to manage and view agent details within Zoom Workforce Management. \nService Announcements \nZoom Software Lifecycle Policy -\n We plan to enforce the next round of our Software Lifecycle Policy on August 3, 2024. Please check our \nsupport article \nfor the table of products and corresponding minimum versions. Users who are running an end-of-life version after August 3 will be logged out of their Zoom app (Desktop, Mobile, and VDI) or not be able to join meetings via the Zoom Client until they update. As always, we highly recommend you regularly download and update to the latest version of Zoom software by checking for updates within the Zoom app or by navigating to \nzoom.us/download\n\u00a0to take advantage of all our latest security and functionality features.\u00a0\u00a0\nHappy Zooming,\nZoom Success Advisor\n\u00a0\nYou're receiving this email because you are a Zoom customer.\nIf you wish to be removed from our email list, \nunsubscribe\n or \nmanage your email preferences.",

    "subject": "From Day One: The Trouble With Test Projects",
    "body": "Current dispatches from the job market describe an exhausting scene. On one side are overloaded recruiters, shuffling thousands of applications for a single role. On the other side are weary applicants feeling devalued by drawn-out interview cycles and unresponsive employers.\n\u00a0\nOne particular point of tension is the candidate test project. To evaluate applicants\u2019 skills and narrow the talent pool, employers are now frequently asking job candidates to complete test projects or evaluations in the form of strategy proposals, presentations, blog posts, research projects, and video-editing tests, to name a few. But job seekers are getting burned out, sinking hours into unpaid projects with seemingly little relevance to the role, only to be ignored or rejected by an automated email.\n\u00a0\nIt's rough out there, especially for well-paid office workers seeking a new job. \u201cWelcome to the white-collar recession,\u201d declared Business Insider. Reports Wall Street Journal columnist Callum Borchers: \u201cI hear from a lot of white-collar workers on the job hunt who say it\u2019s much harder to get hired than the unemployment numbers make it sound.\u201d Said Bloomberg: \u201cTake-home assignments during the interview process are on the rise, irking candidates.\u201d\n\u00a0\nWhile employers may have the advantage at the moment, they should avoid overplaying their hand, since their reputations are at stake. Job seekers who spoke to From Day One describe growing cynical and suspicious of companies that request burdensome projects, and especially of those that don\u2019t compensate candidates for their time. Yet it may be the delivery and design of these projects, not their intention, that is souring relations between candidates and companies.\n\u00a0\nHow Test Projects Go Wrong\nBeth Miller (not her real name) has built a 20-year career as a writing instructor and communications practitioner in higher education and nonprofits, and for the last year, following a layoff, she has been on the job hunt.\n\u00a0\nAfter submitting an application for a job in a university\u2019s development office, Miller received an automated email inviting her to complete a performance task: an asynchronous video interview that was expected to take 30 minutes. Uncomfortable on camera yet eager to do it well, Miller sunk four hours into the project.\n\u00a0\nA week later, at about 9 p.m. on the Thursday before Memorial Day weekend, Miller received an email with another request: a full grant proposal to be completed over the holiday, she told From Day One. When Miller replied with questions, her emails quickly bounced back with out-of-office messages.\n\u00a0\n\u201cThe most difficult thing is that the emails were not coming from a person,\u201d she said. They were addressed to \u2018dear applicant,\u2019 and signed, \u2018the hiring team,\u2019\u201d she said. Unable to get a new due date for the assignment, Miller gave up her weekend to the project.\n\u00a0\nMiller\u2019s story is like that of many job seekers right now. Unwieldy evaluations are popping up across industries and job types, and in a labor market where the competition is often among the applicants, rather than the employers, candidates are getting burnt out by the requests, sometimes completing several projects before they even speak to a recruiter.\n\u00a0\n\u201cThese are, by no means, simple and easy,\u201d said Liane Paonessa, who was applying for director-level roles in corporate PR earlier this year. \u201cThey\u2019re complex, detailed, and basically provide the company with a free strategic plan and content from every candidate.\u201d\n\u00a0\nFurther, they seem to be redundant. Some employers require a portfolio of prior work samples in addition to test projects. \u201cIn most cases, I [got] no feedback whatsoever on the projects, other than a \u2018Thank you for your excellent work,\u2019 before ghosting me and later sending me the standard form rejection email,\u201d said Paonessa.\n\u00a0\nMany job applicants who spoke to From Day One believe that employers use unpaid test projects to get free work from desperate applicants. Job seekers describe being asked to draft 12-month strategy plans, make hour-long presentations, pitch detailed article ideas, write website content, produce fresh code, and even provide names of other people who might be good additions to the company.\nAs exhausted applicants churn through these often unacknowledged projects, it reinforces their cynical beliefs about employers\u2019 attitudes towards job seekers. \u201cIt\u2019s so dehumanizing to constantly be putting yourself at the feet of an organization and trying to tell them why you\u2019re worth hiring,\u201d Miller said. \nRead the full story here\n to find out how employers can do better.\n\u00a0 \nLIVE EVENT HIGHLIGHTS\n\u00a0 \nTotal Well-Being: Optimizing Benefits for a Diverse Workforce: \nAT&T has consistently championed employee wellness, driven by a team dedicated to the four pillars of well-being: mental, social, physical, and financial. So when they introduced an on-site doctor for their workforce, it was a natural move, given their forward-thinking approach. In a fireside chat, Stacey Marx, \nAT&T\u2019s\n SVP of total rewards & HR technology, discussed the impact of Covid on corporate well-being and how the company stays ahead in supporting their employees. \u201cThat really put a bright light on wellness,\u201d she said at \nFrom Day One\u2019s Dallas conference\n, in conversation with Lauren Crawford, reporter for CBS News Texas. \nRead the full story here.\n\u00a0\nBuilding Upon Workplace Culture Through Recognition, Inclusion, and Belonging:\u00a0\nTraditionally, the railroad industry has not been viewed as welcoming to female workers. Yet at BNSF Railway, women are seeing a future in railroading. Kalisha Holland, \nBNSF Railway\n\u2019s chief diversity and inclusion officer and general director of talent acquisition, says that employee resource groups (ERGs) play a crucial role in fostering a culture of belonging. BNSF has 10 of these groups, but \u201cwe\u2019ve taken it a step further,\u201d said Holland during an executive panel conversation at the Dallas conference.\u00a0 \nRead the full story here.\n\u00a0\nFiring Up the Talent Engines at One of the World\u2019s Largest Airlines: \nThe travel industry took a drastic hit during the pandemic; flights were near-empty as people stayed home. For one airline, however, the pause was the optimal time to expand. In the first few years of the pandemic, \nUnited Airlines\n hired more than \n30,000 employees\n, a decision that differed from many other industries at that time. \u201c\u200b\u200bIn the months of the pandemic, we pre-hired in a couple of areas, pilots in particular, because of the long training timelines,\u201d Kate Gebo, the airline\u2019s EVP of HR and labor relations, said in a \nfireside chat at From Day One\u2019s Chicago conference\n. \u201cThat was not something that we had historically ever done, but in the first few years of the pandemic, we hired 15,000 people each year for two years.\u201d \nRead the full story here.\n\u00a0\n\u00a0 \nVIRTUAL EVENT HIGHLIGHTS\n\u00a0 \nHow to Improve the Recruiting Process for Technical Talent:\n \u201cThere\u2019s a record number of candidates applying for roles. I think it takes a good, solid recruiting strategy to ensure inclusivity practices are followed,\u201d said Cody Ledbetter, senior technical recruiter at\n O\u2019Reilly Auto Parts\n, during a\n From Day One panel discussion\n on how to build an exceptional recruitment process. According to Amanda Richardson, CEO at technical interview platform\n CoderPad\n, this increase in application volume is forcing recruiters to make changes. She observes companies abandoning loosely planned, informal interviews for more conscientious decision-making. \u201cIt\u2019s nice to see companies being a little more organized, disciplined, and clear in their hiring processes,\u201d she said. \nRead the full story here.\n\u00a0\nHow to Make Upskilling and Reskilling Part of a Corporate Culture of Learning: \nWhen there\u2019s a problem at \nFortive Corp\n., the company invites the best and brightest to put their heads together and come up with a solution. That means anyone willing to come with an open mind and think creatively. \u201cIt\u2019s good to have a few experts who know exactly what the process is and why, what the critical steps are, and things like that. But it is even more important to have people who know nothing about the process,\u201d said Shannon Flynn, VP of corporate HR at the industrial-technology company. How employers can create a culture of corporate learning was the topic of discussion among a panel of HR experts during \nFrom Day One\u2019s May virtual conference\n. The events of the day addressed employee retention, coaching, and advancement. \nRead the full story here.\n\u00a0\nDeveloping Crucial Competencies Among Managers to Enhance Inclusion: \nTo improve workplaces, leaders need to reevaluate how they are growing their managers and provide the proper support. In a \nFrom Day One webinar,\n Lydia Dishman, senior editor of growth and engagement at \nFast Company\n, spoke with leaders about the strategies they\u2019re taking to address skills gaps in their companies, especially those related to boosting workplace inclusion. Self-aware leaders display a higher level of confidence and empathy, resulting in stronger teams and effective leadership. Yet despite most leaders believing that they exhibit self-awareness, research shows only \n10% to 15% of leaders\n are self-aware. \nRead the full story here.\n\u00a0\n\u00a0 \nQUICK HITS\n\u00a0 \nCaught You Faking: Wells Fargo Firings Expose Workplace Surveillance Dilemma:\n Wells Fargo\u2019s decision to fire more than a dozen employees for \u201csimulation of keyboard activity\u201d points to a simmering tension in the \npost-pandemic workplace\n. Like many \nother big banks\n, Wells Fargo has moved to get more workers in the office more of the time. Most have to turn up at least three days a week. Why it matters: Major employers are using \nsurveillance tools\n to ensure that no matter where people work, they're at their computers, but polls suggest doing so is risky for morale. Wells Fargo didn\u2019t say whether the employees\u2013from the company's wealth- and investment-management unit\u2013were working remotely, or how they were faking the \u201cimpression of active work,\u201d Bloomberg \nreports\n. \nRead the full story here.\n\u00a0\nHow \u201cCarewashing\u201d Alienates Employees:\n Post-pandemic, employees have experienced record-high stress and burnout and are increasingly attracted to organizations with cultures that support well-being at work. A 2024 Gallup survey indicates that the percentage of employees who strongly agree that their organization cares about their overall well-being \nhas plunged\n from 49% in 2020 to 21% in 2024, while a \nprevious survey\n found that improving well-being and culture rated much higher than increasing compensation among the things\u00a0 \u201cquiet quitters\u201d would like to change about their work. Too many organizations with unsustainable \u201cwork hard, play hard\u201d cultures believe that checking the well-being box by offering mindfulness training or yoga classes qualifies them as having a positive and safe culture when, in fact, they\u2019re merely \u201ccarewashing,\u201d as reported by Harvard Business Review. \nRead the full story here. \nA Day in the Life of a California Fast-Food Manager Who Makes Up to $174,000: \nMonique Pizano has spent three years as a general manager and her six-figure earnings have helped her save for a house down payment, take a honeymoon to Japan, and support her mom. The 27-year-old from Ontario, Calif., feels lucky\u2014many of her fellow University of California, Riverside, graduates haven\u2019t been able to find jobs or are earning low hourly wages. Pizano is one of about 850 general managers for Raising Cane\u2019s, where her pay can reach $174,000 annually, including bonuses based on her location\u2019s sales and profit, reports the Wall Street Journal. The fast-growing chicken chain views its managers as critical partners, and the company, based in Baton Rouge, La., pays them to be perfectionists. \u201cIt\u2019s been life-changing for my family,\u201d Pizano said about her job and earnings. \nRead the full story here.\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0 \nSPONSOR SPOTLIGHT: WORKTANGO\n\u00a0 \nHow Investing in Employee Experience Brings a Positive Return: \nWith all the employee-experience software options to choose from, the idea of choosing one to incorporate into your HR structure can be daunting. And in times of tightening budgets, it can be challenging to make the case for the spending. But according to a \nrecent study\n by employee experience platform \nWorkTango\n, organizations that invest in employee-experience software see a 2-to-3 times return on the money they put into it. The study surveyed 1,077 North American HR leaders, 90% of whom said that knowing which employees are engaged is especially important in an uncertain economic climate. As WorkTango states in its recent report, \u201cEX investments represent a low risk and high potential reward when it comes to creating an employee experience that connects your workforce across hybrid environments, supports the daily efforts of individual employees, and enables every team member to perform at their highest level.\u201d \nRead the full story here\n and \ndownload WorkTango\u2019s ROI report here\n.\u00a0\n\u00a0 \nSPONSOR SPOTLIGHT:\nFOUNTAIN\n\u00a0 \nExcellence in Hiring: Designing the Optimal Frontline Employee Selection Process: \nIf a job application takes more than 15 minutes to complete, \nmore than 70% of job seekers say\n they\u2019ll bounce, according to a 2022 survey reported in HR Dive. This barrier is particularly germane to companies that employ frontline workers, often working against a narrow time-to-hire. Time matters, and even a small amount of friction can be enough to convince a job seeker to look elsewhere. \u201cGoing from three business days down to a one-second communication timeframe was huge for us,\u201d said Carlie Lockey, the founder and CEO of \nRemarkable People Solutions\n. Lockey\u2019s business had reached a tipping point: she needed to scale operations quickly, but couldn\u2019t forfeit speed or efficiency. She shared what she learned from the process during a \nrecent From Day One webinar.\n \nRead the full story here.\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0 \nSPONSOR SPOTLIGHT:\nWIZEHIVE\n\u00a0 \nElevate Employee Engagement: Smart Strategies for Thriving Teams on a Budget. \nEmployees crave meaningful experiences. But with limited time and budgets, how can companies build more purpose into the work experience? Fifteen minutes at a time, says Ben Sampson. Coming from a volunteer background, Sampson is now chief evangelist of social impact and employee engagement at \nWizeHive\n, which offers software platforms for managing scholarships and workplace giving, as well as immersive volunteer experiences via WeHero. At a \nFrom Day One\u2019s webinar\n, Sampson spoke to the idea of how turnkey volunteering can increase employee engagement on a budget. \nRead the full story here.\n\u00a0\n\u00a0 \n\u00a0 \nUPCOMING EVENTS\n\u00a0 \nWEBINARS\n\u00a0\nGet credit!

As a result, employers increasingly are seeking to incorporate SUD treatment into their benefit offerings through their EAP or mental health provider.\nHowever, a behavioral health strategy that doesn\u2019t include dedicated substance-use management has significant shortcomings when it comes to efficacy and cost control. In this employer-focused webinar, we\u2019ll explore why Beacon Health System invested in dedicated substance-use management for their employees and the results they\u2019ve achieved, focusing on cost savings, outcomes, and member engagement. This session aims to foster understanding of the complexities of SUD care and highlight the clinical and financial impact that dedicated substance-use treatment provides. \nRegister now.\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\nJuly 11: What Makes Skills-Based Hiring the Most Effective Approach. \nSkills data is among the most usable and powerful talent intelligence that organizations can collect and leverage to be effective in hiring today, as well as agile in the future.

In this fireside chat, powered by research from SHL, the talent-insights company, you'll learn about the many benefits of taking a skills-based approach; the different type of skills that exist in the workplace and how to describe, categorize, and map them into a framework; and which skills are universally predictive of success and can be used to hire for potential. \nRegister now.\n\u00a0\nJuly 16: Managing Headcount More Effectively to Meet Talent Needs and Financial Goals. \nWorkforce planning in many organizations is uncoordinated, with decentralized data and teams failing to coordinate. The consequences can be serious: delayed decision-making, overspending, and missed revenue targets. What\u2019s needed: a strategic imperative to build a more cohesive and collaborative system, which can underpin fiscal health and boost organizational growth. In this webinar, leaders from companies who\u2019ve pursued cutting-edge methods will tell how they integrated their fragmented data sources to provide an accurate and actionable view, as well as how they enhanced collaboration between talent and finance leaders to align strategic decisions with company goals. The result: nearly painless headcount planning for modern companies. \nRegister now.\n\u00a0\nJuly 25: Supporting Tomorrow's Leaders: Innovative and Engaging Approaches for Leadership Development. \nA well-structured leadership program ensures that emerging leaders have the skills and confidence to excel in their roles.

This uncertainty leaves talent management and employee development journeys to guesswork, resulting in lost opportunities and strategic missteps. Organizations that utilize data about their talent's skills, or catalog and organize the skills workers currently possess, as well as identify the skills needed for future roles, are actively preparing their workforce to tackle new challenges as they arise. In this session, leaders will discuss how talent skills data can transform your approach to talent management, offer steps to start your journey and get ahead of the curve, and uncover how skills data can be used to facilitate and drive organizational goals. \nRegister now.\u00a0\n\u00a0\nAugust 8: How Global Companies Foster Continuous Learning. \nA continuous culture of learning empowers employees by enhancing their skills and making them feel valued and capable of contributing to organizational success.

But a new survey reports that only 1% of U.S. women have menopause support as part of their employee-sponsored benefits. What\u2019s more, according to a new survey, 85% of women said they don\u2019t know enough about menopause, and 83% experiencing menopause report that their symptoms impact their ability to work. Join us to learn how employers can better support women experiencing \u201cThe Change,\u201d and the impact it can have on productivity, medical spending, and retention. \nRegister now\n.\n\u00a0\nLIVE EVENTS\n\u00a0\nJoin us in the real world!

    "subject": "From Day One: Why ADHD Is Still a Forbidden Topic at Work",
    "body": "You don't often get email from editor@fromdayone.co. \nLearn why this is important\nDespite increasing openness about mental health, a condition as common as ADHD still carries a stigma. If workers and managers could become more comfortable talking about it, workplaces would be more productive and less stressful, according to psychotherapist Lesley Alderman. As she reports in a new story for From Day One:\u00a0\n\u00a0\nPete came to our weekly psychotherapy session frustrated with work. He had just returned to his office, post pandemic, and found the new, open plan noisy and overwhelming. Pete, which is not his real name, has ADHD (\nattention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder\n) and is easily distractible and sensitive to noise. He had trouble concentrating, was irritated by the constant chatter of colleagues, and, as a result, was feeling less productive.\n\u00a0\n\u201cCould you talk to your manager about getting some accommodations?\u201d I asked.\n\u00a0\n\u201cNo way!\u201d he said. \u201cThat would be a career killer.\u201d\n\u00a0\nPete\u2019s wariness is not uncommon. A few of my psychotherapy patients with ADHD have confided in their managers, but most feel it\u2019s unwise to do so. They fear they will be stigmatized and sidelined.\n\u00a0\nEdward Hallowell, M.D., agrees with their concern. The founder of \nthe Hallowell ADHD Centers\n and one of the leading authorities on the disorder, explained to From Day One: \u201cWe\u2019re not there yet. Most corporate professionals think of ADHD as some kind of mental illness.\u201d\n\u00a0\nGiven that ADHD is not well-understood in the workplace, how can employees speak up about their needs in a way that feels safe? And how can managers and HR leaders better understand how to respond to those needs\u2013whether employees want to name their ADHD, or not? A well-accommodated employee is, after all, a happier and more productive one. \u201cIt\u2019s in everyone\u2019s best interest to remove obstacles to someone\u2019s performance,\u201d said Hallowell.\u00a0\nHere\u2019s what experts recommend:\n\u00a0\nKnow What It Is\nADHD is a neuro-developmental disorder characterized by symptoms of restlessness, impulsivity and difficulty sustaining attention to boring tasks. It tends to run in families and is often inherited from a parent. There are three types: inattentive (dreamy and distractible), hyperactive-impulsive (restless and talkative), and a combination of the two. Most adults with ADHD have the inattentive type. Though it was long considered to be a childhood disorder affecting mostly boys, research has shown that it persists into adulthood\u2014about 30% to 70% of children with ADHD continue to have symptoms later in life.\n\u00a0\nAn undiagnosed adult may think of themselves as spacey, messy, or undisciplined\u2014and they often suffer from low self-esteem. A recent study found that \nonly 10% to 25% of adults with ADHD receive an accurate diagnosis and adequate treatmen\nt. \u201cThey are often inaccurately diagnosed with anxiety or depression, which are really just the fallout of untreated ADHD,\u201d said \nAri Tuckman\n, a psychologist in West Chester, Penn., who specializes in the treatment of ADHD. As Hallowell puts it: \u201cIt\u2019s like driving on square wheels.\u201d In dealing with tasks, you will make progress, but it may take longer.\n\u00a0\nAnd That the Diagnosis Is on the Rise\nWhile children are still the most likely group to be identified with the disorder, the number of adult diagnoses has been rising for decades. The pandemic accelerated the trend: the overall incidence in adults (30 to 49 years old) nearly doubled from 2020 to 2022, fueled mainly by an increase in diagnoses among women, \naccording to Epic Research\n, a medical-record software company. While it\u2019s not clear exactly why women are being diagnosed more often, experts theorize that it may be due to increasing smartphone and technology use, which can amplify distractibility and stress, as well as a greater awareness that ADHD can also be a women\u2019s issue. As more adults are diagnosed, they\u2014like Pete\u2014often face workplaces that are not ADHD-literate.\n\u00a0\nHow It Affects Work Performance\u2013But Not Always in a Bad Way\nPeople with the disorder may have difficulty with organization, time management and procrastination\u2014all of which can make it hard to meet deadlines and work within teams. They find tedious tasks, such as scheduling and filling out expense reports, unusually challenging and have a different sense of time than others. \u201cPeople with ADHD have more difficulty seeing time and feeling the future,\u201d notes Tuckman,\n\u00a0\nMore than half (56%) of adults with ADHD said they believe the disorder \u201cstrongly impacts their ability to succeed at work,\u201d \naccording to a 2008 survey\n by McNeil Pediatrics. A more recent \nsurvey\n by Akili, a therapeutic-technology company, interviewed 500 adults with ADHD and found that employees with ADHD felt the disorder had a negative impact on their career.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\n\u00a0\nAnd yet, people with ADHD often display qualities that work in their favor, notes Hallowell, who himself has ADHD. He sees the condition as a trait, not a disorder, that has positive benefits like creativity, humor, and spontaneity. \u201cThere\u2019s more to it than most people realize,\u201d he said. \u201cADHD is a terrible term. We have an abundance of attention. Our challenge is where to put our focus.\u201d People with ADHD can spend hours on topics that interest them and see details that others might miss, a trait sometimes called \nhyperfocus\n. Many successful people have talked openly about their ADHD, including \nMichael Phelps\n, \nSimone Biles\n, \nJames Carville\n, astronaut \nScott Kelly\n and JetBlue founder \nDavid Neeleman\n.\n\u00a0\nHow to Get Diagnosed\nIf you persistently miss deadlines, are chronically late, and feel like staying organized is a big effort, first ask a trusted friend or colleague if they find you more scattered than others. Then, make an appointment to see a psychologist or psychiatrist who specializes in treating the condition. There is no one standardized test\u2014instead a professional will take a thorough history and may ask family members and friends to complete questionnaires about your behavior. You may be asked questions like, How often do you misplace items, feel bored and restless, or lose track of what needs to be done? If you meet the criteria, your doctor may talk to you about medication, therapy or coaching and, if needed, provide a diagnosis so you can receive accommodations at school or at work.\n\u00a0\nOnce you are diagnosed and have figured out the best treatment, it\u2019s like \u201cgetting fitted for the right eyeglasses,\u201d said Hallowell. \u201cThings come into sharper focus.\u201d \nRead the full story here\n, including ways to make the workplace more ADHD-friendly.\n\u00a0 \nFEATURE\n\u00a0 \nThe Google Firings: a Signal of a \u2018Course Correction\u2019 on Corporate Dissent: \nCorporate America\u2019s historic experiment in free speech appears to be reaching a turning point. For a time, big employers showed a growing tolerance of workers speaking out on social and political issues\u2013with even company leaders making bold pronouncements on emerging issues. In a signal event last month, Google \nfired 50 employees\n who took part in sit-ins to protest the company\u2019s contracts with the Israeli government. Nine of them were \narrested for trespassing\n. \u201cI find it fascinating how [Google] created a corporate culture where a sit-in was the only way that the employees thought they could be heard, and the only management response they could imagine was to fire everybody,\u201d John Higgins, who researches and writes about employee activism, told From Day One. \nRead the full story here.\n\u00a0 \nLIVE EVENT HIGHLIGHTS\n\u00a0 \nBalancing Tradition and Transformation While Hiring Thousands of New Workers: \nAmtrak\n is seeing a new era of rail travel. With billions of dollars in new investments, the company has added over 8,000 employees in the past two years alone, with an expected 4,000 additional workers for the rest of 2024.The new wave of workers ushered in requires a fresh perspective in managing, says Robert Grasty, Amtrak\u2019s EVP and chief HR officer. At \nFrom Day One\u2019s Washington, D.C. \nconference, Grasty spoke with moderator and \nWashington Post\n reporter Lori Aratani to discuss how he\u2019s leading the new generation of employees in this new age of railroad travel. \nRead the full story here.\n\u00a0\nCultivating a Strong Corporate Culture in a Changing Work Dynamic: \nEveryone waited for business to go back to normal following the pandemic. But the pandemic has created a ripple effect that may have changed the workplace forever. Take the tech industry, for example. Jennifer Christie, chief people officer of \nDocuSign\n, says that before the pandemic, tech talent was at a premium. But as everyone went remote and everything shifted, tech jobs were less in demand. Christie spoke about the changing work dynamic at \nthe D.C. conference.\n \nRead the full story here.\nDo Your Workers Feel a Sense of Belonging and Recognition?: \nFor Emma E. Houston, chief diversity officer at the \nUniversity of Utah\n, it starts with hello. \u201cOne of the things that I make a habit of doing is saying, \u2018Good morning, good afternoon, good evening.\u2019 Because [it\u2019s] important for individuals to be seen.\u201d Employees thrive and remain in organizations where they feel included and valued. Creating a comfortable space where everyone feels that they are heard and seen is crucial to recruitment and retention. During a panel discussion at \nFrom Day One\u2019s conference in Salt Lake City\n, four experts offered tips on helping employees feel that they have a part in the conversation. \nRead the full story here.\n\u00a0 \nVIRTUAL EVENT HIGHLIGHTS\n\u00a0 \nHow to Provide Fertility Benefits Without Breaking the Bank: \nInfertility impacts one in every six couples who are trying to conceive, according to the \nWorld Health Organization\n. \u201cThat number is staggering,\u201d said Jenny Carillo, president of \nOvia Health\n, who spoke in a recent \nFrom Day One webinar.\n \u201cWe\u2019re seeing the average age of people who are trying to initiate their family-building efforts increasing,\u201d she told moderator Lydia Dishman, a senior editor at Fast Company. \u201cPeople are now trying to conceive in their 30s and 40s, when they\u2019re becoming less fertile.\u201d And yet only 15% of employees have access to fertility benefits, according to \na report\n from Ovia Health. \nRead the full story here\n.\nThe Three Pillars of Wellness: Physical, Mental, and Financial. \nThe three pillars of wellness are like three legs on a stool. Lose one, and the whole thing tips over. Rather than thinking in terms of separate concerns, the more effective approach for benefits leaders is to see how three pillars support an employee\u2019s overall well-being. In a recent fireside chat at \nFrom Day One\u2019s April virtual conference\n, Nate Nevas, head of benefits and health services at \nPitney Bowes\n, provided an inside look at how to provide individualized care for a diverse workforce. \nRead the full story here.\n\u00a0\nHow a Leader Brings Clarity to Benefits Offerings: \n\u201cBenefits, perks, compensation\u2013they\u2019re all taken into account when job offers are made. That\u2019s how you remain competitive. We don\u2019t have to offer every single benefit that\u2019s out there. We just have to offer the right ones.\u201d This is according to Lenka Sloman, the head of total rewards at global advertising firm \nGroupM\n. Sloman joined the company last year, taking over the company\u2019s benefits offerings and finding ways for GroupM to remain competitive for top talent. During a fireside chat at \nFrom Day One\u2019s April virtual conference\n, Sloman discussed her strategy for getting the best return on investment for GroupM\u2019s total rewards. Her challenge is finding the balance between market demands and individual needs. \nRead the full story here.\n\u00a0 \nQUICK HITS\n\u00a0 \nDEI is Getting a New Name. Can It Dump the Political Baggage?\u00a0\nLast year, Eli Lilly\u2019s annual shareholders letter used the abbreviation for diversity, equity and inclusion 48 times. This year, \u201cDEI\u201d is nowhere to be found. Amid growing legal, social and political backlash, American businesses, industry groups and employment professionals are quietly scrubbing DEI from public view \u2014 though not necessarily abandoning its practice. As they rebrand programs and hot-button acronyms, they\u2019re reassessing decades-old anti-discrimination strategies and rewriting policies that once emphasized race and gender to prioritize inclusion for all, as reported by the Washington Post. \nRead the full story here\n.\nHow AI Has Already Begun to Change These Workers\u2019 Jobs: \nA doctor looks her patients in the eye. A lawyer is able to take on more cases. A marketer dispenses with focus groups. Artificial intelligence hasn\u2019t been the job killer that some predicted, at least not so far. Census data released in March showed that 2.6% of employers reported cutting jobs between July and February in response to the introduction of generative AI\u2014and 2.8% reported adding jobs because of it, reports the Wall Street Journal. But in subtle and not-so-subtle ways, generative AI is already changing how some people work. \nRead the full story here\n.\nWhen Someone You Manage Isn\u2019t Following the Return-to-Office Policy: \nEver since the first return-to-office mandates emerged in 2021, managers have grappled with the delicate task of balancing organizational policies with the preferences of their employees. According to a survey by ResumeBuilder.com, 90% of companies with office space will put in place RTO policies by the end of this year, with most tracking employee attendance, cites the Harvard Business Review. These decisions thrust managers in the center of a protracted RTO battle, tasking them with implementing policies they had no hand in creating and might not fully support. So, what should you do about team members who are still dragging their feet? How can you maintain a positive work environment without causing unnecessary tension? \nRead the full story here.\n\u00a0 \nSPONSOR SPOTLIGHTS\n\u00a0 \nMARSH MCLENNAN AGENCY\n\u00a0\u00a0\n\u00a0\nNavigating the Future of Business With Resilience and Innovation: \n\u00a0When Amy Letke, national practice leader for HR consulting at \nMarsh McLennan Agency\n, talks about innovative HR strategy, she points to one of her clients as a perfect example. This company has a workplace with harsh conditions that most of us would find unattractive. Yet its attrition rate is remarkably low. \u201cWe\u2019ve invested in our people,\u201d the client told Letke, who spoke in a thought leadership spotlight at \nFrom Day One\u2019s D.C. event\n. By offering a holistic benefits package and engaging not just the employees, but also their families with a welcoming company culture, this organization convinced workers not only to stay, but to thrive in a very tough job. \nRead the full story here.\n\u00a0\nWORKTANGO\n\u00a0\nWhy Investing in the Employee Experience Is More Important Than Ever: \n\u201cWe\u2019re coming to times where promotions are not going to be as available. How can I make you feel happy here on a day-to-day basis, especially when a year may come where you may not see that next step?\u201d This is the question Ashley Collado-Jaime, people operations manager at \nMedidata Solutions\n, posed to From Day One\u2019s audience in a \nwebinar about investing in the employee experience\n. With tighter budgets and fewer resources, people leaders face the challenge of creating more holistic and sustainable strategies, and more of them recognize measuring ROI goes beyond the scope of using metrics alone. \nRead the full story here.\n\u00a0\nEMPOWERLY FOR EMPLOYERS\n\u00a0\nWhy College Prep for Teens May Become the Next Workplace Benefit: \nEmployers offer a wide variety of benefits for the working parents of young children, from onsite childcare and paid leave to fertility and conception benefits, but what about support for parents of older children and teens? During the teen years, \u201cThere\u2019s a massive emotional strain between parents and teenagers that folks are way too familiar with. There\u2019s financial uncertainty,\u201d said Jonathan Murray, head of \nEmpowerly for Employers\n. And \u201ccollege prep is a major source of stress for these parents and has a significant impact on workplace productivity.\u201d In a \nFrom Day One webinar\n, Murray spoke on the compelling reasons for employers to support their workforce during these critical years. \nRead the full story here.\nACTIVTRAK\n\u00a0\nHow to Keep a Hybrid Workforce Engaged and Productive: \nAs of February, more than half (54%) of employees in the U.S. who can work remotely adhere to a hybrid schedule, and 27% are exclusively remote, according to \ndata from Gallup\n. Yet many employers remain suspicious of remote and hybrid arrangements, fearing lack of productivity, weakening engagement, performance, and lost opportunities for employee collaboration and innovation. During a \nrecent From Day One webinar\n on engaging a hybrid workforce, Gabriela Mauch, head of the productivity lab at workforce analytics software platform \nActivTrak\n, and her colleague Sarah Altemus, productivity lab manager, spoke about how employers can better and\u2013more responsibly\u2013use employee productivity data. \nRead the full story here.\n\u00a0 \n\u00a0 \nUPCOMING EVENTS\n\u00a0 \nWEBINARS\n\u00a0\nGet credit!

But family-forming can be costly. Surrogacy, for example, typically costs $60,000 to $100,000 per child.

As a result, employers increasingly are seeking to incorporate SUD treatment into their benefit offerings through their EAP or mental health provider. However, a behavioral health strategy that doesn\u2019t include dedicated substance-use management has significant shortcomings when it comes to efficacy and cost control. In this employer-focused webinar, we\u2019ll explore why a leading health care system invested in dedicated substance-use management for their employees and the results they\u2019ve achieved, focusing on cost savings, outcomes, and member engagement.

This page is only available to Zoom account owners and admins; you must sign in to view them.\nRelease notes\n \u2013 A complete list of past releases across the Zoom platform.\u00a0\n\u00a0\nIf you have questions about the features and announcements outlined below, please reply directly to this email.\n\u00a0\n*Note: Some products and features may not be available to all customers.\u00a0\nBusiness Updates \nZoom app now named Zoom Workplace app -\n \nZoom Workplace\n\u00a0is our new, AI-powered collaboration platform designed to help your organization reimagine teamwork by streamlining communications, increasing employee engagement, optimizing in-person time, and improving productivity across flexible work. It\u2019s everything you trust and love about Zoom\u2019s core communications products, combined with our \nemployee engagement\n, \nspaces\n, and \nproductivity solutions\n, all within the Zoom experience, with AI woven throughout. For more information on what\u2019s changed, see the \nZoom Workplace App release notes\n.\u00a0\nKey Highlights from Zoom\u2019s April Releases \nZoom Workplace App\n\u00a0Updates \nConsolidated Meeting and Calendar tabs - \nWindows, macOS, Linux - The Meetings and Calendar tabs are merging to provide the greater visibility of the calendar view with the meeting details needed for your daily tasks. Easily view and filter upcoming meetings, view the invitees and their responses, and review shared materials ahead of the session, while also reviewing previous meetings and their assets, such as recordings, continuous meeting chats, whiteboards, and more. This change will be rolled out to accounts over time and be controlled through a web setting available at the account, group, and user levels. Initially, Basic, Pro, and some smaller Business accounts will have this available with the March release, with this enabled by default for those Basic and Pro accounts. Other accounts can expect this in an upcoming release, which can be managed for eligible accounts through the \nFeature Release Controls\n. \nPersonalized in-meeting toolbars - \nWindows, macOS, Linux - Zoom Meeting participants can personalize the in-meeting toolbar by dragging-and-dropping to add, move, and remove meetings feature options to suit their needs. Buttons can be reordered, or dragged to/from the More menu. Personalizations for signed-in users will be synced across their desktop experiences. Additionally, the default in-meeting toolbar has fewer buttons and consolidated many options under the More menu to support improved ease of use. The Audio , Video , More and End options cannot be removed from the in-meeting toolbar. Additionally, the floating screen-sharing toolbar is updated and simplified to make it easier to use and more focused on core tasks while presenting during a meeting. \nExpanded language support Chat Compose and Thread Summary with AI Companion features -\n Windows, macOS, Linux - AI Companion features for Team Chat support a broader range of languages for both Chat Compose and Thread Summary features, expanding from 9 to 38 languages, including English. All supported languages will include English, French, French (CA), German, Spanish, Italian, Portuguese, Chinese (Simplified), Russian, Japanese, Korean, Dutch, Ukrainian, Chinese (Traditional), Czech, Estonian, Finnish, Hungarian, Polish, Turkish, Vietnamese, Hindi, Romanian, Bangla, Danish, Indonesian, Malay, Norwegian, Tagalog, Tamil, Telugu, Swedish, Arabic, Hebrew, Cantonese, Thai, Greek, and Welsh.\u00a0 \nZoom Web\n\u00a0Updates \nPersonal Meeting Room Authentication: Admin controls -\n Admins have greater control over use of required authentication for their users\u2019 Personal Meeting Room. Admins can require participants to be authenticated to join their users\u2019 Personal Meeting Room, as well as choosing a specific admin-created authentication profile. This setting is available at the account, group, and user level settings pages and must be enabled by Zoom. \nGreek, Bengali, Norwegian, and Welsh support for \ntranslated captions\n\u00a0-\n Accounts using the translated captions feature will be able to have automated captions translated from any currently supported language to Greek, Bengali, Norwegian, and Welsh, facilitating easier communication between participants in Zoom Meetings. Translated captioning is not yet supported when translating from these languages, as they are not yet supported for automated captioning. These languages are enabled by default, but admins can control availability of this through the Translated captions setting in the web portal. \nZoom Contact Center\n\u00a0Updates \nScheduled callbacks -\n Account owners and admins can set up the ability for consumers to schedule a callback for voice and video from Brand\u2019s website without having to enter a queue. Consumers will be prompted to enter their name, phone number, and callback time. At their scheduled time, the callback is initiated as soon as the agent is ready. Supervisors will be able to view scheduled callbacks from the Engagements page in the desktop client. This feature must be enabled by Zoom. \nEnable Mexico as a storage location for Zoom Contact Center content - \nZoom Contact Center admins can select Mexico as a storage location for recordings, transcripts, and inbox messages. Admins can enable Mexico storage on both the account level and for individual queues. This provides more flexibility for customers who need to meet data residency requirements. Storing data locally in Mexico helps customers comply with regulations. It also provides parity with upcoming Meetings and Phone support. \nMulti-language support for AI features - \nAI-generated content such as Engagement Previews, Follow-Up Tasks, and Smart Notes will now be generated with the agent's preferred language set in their client, irrespective of the language used between the customer and agent. This provides a personalized and consistent experience for agents across all supported languages. Presently, this feature is available for all messaging channels, with voice and video channels set to be included soon. \nZoom Phone\n\u00a0Updates \nEnhancements to prevent unauthorized audio uploads in Zoom web portal -\n Account owners and admins can now set a policy to prevent users from uploading audio files in the Zoom web portal. This prevents users from uploading copyrighted audio content for features like voicemail greetings, music on hold, and call queue announcements. When enabled, users will be unable to upload audio to the Zoom web portal. Users can still record or generate audio using text-to-speech. This feature is in Beta. \nSubmit a request\n\u00a0to Zoom Support to get it enabled for your account. \nZoom Events\n\u00a0Updates \nAnalytics for unique Video On Demand viewers and anonymous viewer sessions - \nHosts can access detailed analytics reports for Video On Demand (VOD) channels. For authenticated viewers where an email address is collected, the report will show unique viewers by month and attach associated content views and engagement. For anonymous sessions where no email address is collected, the report will show viewer sessions by day along with associated content and engagement. These analytics provide increased visibility into both identifiable and anonymous Video On Demand viewers to help hosts understand overall platform usage and engagement. \nMore Control and Flexibility for AI-Generated Event Images -\n There are several enhancements to the AI image generation capability for Zoom Events. Hosts have more control over the image creation process and can zoom in on image previews, remove the black background, and optimize the smart prompt suggestion. The updated experience also provides more variation between the suggested images and gives the resulting files more relevant names based on the original prompt.\nZoom Virtual Agent\n\u00a0Updates \nEnhancements to manual Knowledge Base content upload - \nAccount owners and admins can manually upload Knowledge Base content in several new ways, including via CSV, PDF, or DOCX file or manual text entry. These enhancements allow Knowledge Base admins to include offline content from various sources in bulk or individually in their Knowledge Base. Having the ability to manually upload content provides more flexibility and control over populating Knowledge Bases. \nEnhanced PDF import feature for Knowledge Bases - \nA new PDF upload feature has been added to improve importing PDF files as knowledge base content. Users can upload multiple PDFs at once through an intuitive interface instead of navigating multiple screens or manual uploads. The batch upload supports uploading 25 PDFs simultaneously to be incorporated into the knowledge base. This simplifies managing PDF knowledge bases, helping to save valuable time and avert possible errors and inefficiencies. \nZoom Workforce Management\n\u00a0Updates \nComprehensive audit trail for agent schedule changes - \nAdmins and supervisors can easily track all modifications made to an agent's schedule for a given day. The new schedule history view shows a timestamped log of every change, beginning with the initial schedule creation. It identifies the user who made each update, so admins and supervisors can understand exactly how the schedule changed. This feature provides much-needed transparency and accountability around schedule changes. \nAgent-initiated schedule change requests -\n Agents have the ability to initiate schedule changes. Agents can submit requests to modify their existing published schedules, such as requesting a break be moved or removed from their schedule completely. Supervisors can then approve or deny these schedule change requests. Admins have the ability to configure which activities are eligible for agent schedule change requests. This allows greater flexibility for agents to manage their schedules while still maintaining oversight through the approval process. \nZoom Whiteboard\n\u00a0Updates \nStructured voting sessions -\n Enhancements to feedback gathering in Whiteboard include structured voting sessions. These improvements encompass the expansion of voting options to include various objects like Sticky Notes, Cards, Shapes, and more. Additionally, users can specify voting parameters, such as the number of votes per user and voting frequency, and export session results as CSV files, among other enhancements. \nEnhancements to viewer interaction - \nUsers with viewer permission can navigate through pages of an embedded document and interact with links on the whiteboard canvas. Previously, viewers had limited interaction capabilities compared to editors. These updates provide viewers with an improved collaboration experience by enabling them to more fully explore shared whiteboards.\nService Announcements \nZoom Software Lifecycle Policy -\n We plan to enforce the next round of our Software Lifecycle Policy on August 3, 2024. Please check our \nsupport article \nfor the table of products and corresponding minimum versions.

My work has been recognized by many, including accolades from our very own Governor DeSantis.

Easily view and filter upcoming meetings, view the invitees and their responses, and review shared materials ahead of the session, while also reviewing previous meetings and their assets, such as recordings, continuous meeting chats, whiteboards, and more. This change will be rolled out to accounts over time and be controlled through a web setting available at the account, group, and user levels. Initially, Basic, Pro, and some smaller Business accounts will have this available with the March release, with this enabled by default for those Basic and Pro accounts. Other accounts can expect this in an upcoming release, which can be managed for eligible accounts through the \nFeature Release Controls\n. \nAI-generated Virtual Backgrounds: Admin control -\n Generate a custom virtual background to suit your needs. Found within the virtual background selection window, eligible users can choose from preset options provided or enter a description of the virtual background they would like to generate.

Admins can control the use of this feature through account and group-level settings. This feature will be rolling out to accounts over the next few months. \nZoom Phone\n\u00a0Updates \nNew member availability report - \nAccount owners and admins can generate a member availability report to view real-time visibility into members' status and availability across call queues. This report shows each agent's Zoom client presence status and call status. Admins can also select a specific call queue to view a member's status. Please note, that the member aggregate number will be removed in the future to avoid confusion on available agents. Please, \nsubmit a request\n\u00a0to Zoom Support to enable this feature for your account. \nEnhanced control and activation for mobile common area phones -\n Admins can now enable or disable in-call features such as call park, transfer to room, and transfer to carrier. The update also includes the ability to export QR codes in bulk, and selectable expiration dates for activation codes help simplify mobile Common Area Phone deployments. \nZoom Events and Sessions\n\u00a0Updates \nIntroducing the session lite event type - \nHosts can create a baseline webinar Zoom Event. This event type is a session lite event type, and it will have a minimalistic attendee experience that does not have a lobby, event detail page, moderation, ticketing, or event branding. Session lite events will only include a link to a registration form and a join link to the session. \nEnhancements to the Zoom Events Image Generation with AI Companion feature - \nIn addition to the user's prompt, three recommended alternative prompts (based on the user's prompt) have been added to the Zoom Events Image Generation feature. Generated images that are inserted are added to the Zoom Events image library automatically. Hosts can also use the Image Generation feature for more areas in the event creation setup: Main Event Image, Session Image, Expo images, In-session branding (virtual background), and Production Studio. \nCustomizable travel info tab for hybrid events -\n Hosts can add a customizable travel and accommodations tab to provide hybrid event attendees with helpful logistics such as embedded maps, airport/hotel directions, parking details, venue guidelines, and contact information. The tab content and visibility can be customized, allowing hosts to share targeted information with in-person attendees. This aims to simplify travel planning so attendees can easily get to the event venue. \nZoom Contact Center\n\u00a0Updates \nAdmin controls for AI Companion for Contact Center - Account\n owners and admins can enable or disable specific AI companion features like Sentiment Analysis, Engagement Summary, Follow Up Tasks, and Talk Metrics. This allows admins to customize which AI features are exposed to agents based on their preferences. These settings can be controlled at the account and queue levels. \nAI-powered live engagement monitoring for agents - \nAI Companion for Contact Center introduces new capabilities to help supervisors monitor and assist agents during live engagements. Supervisors can view real-time consumer sentiment, see live transcripts, and automatically generated conversation summaries to get quick insights. The UI is also enhanced to simplify common supervisor actions like listening in and recording engagements. These AI-powered features help supervisors to effectively monitor agent interactions and assist agents when needed. \nInteractive surveys for consumers - \nAdmins can link surveys to messaging queues and flows to collect feedback from consumers. At the end of a chat, consumers are prompted to take the survey in-chat or later via a web link. The in-chat survey allows consumers to respond to rating scale, multiple choice, and free response questions within the chat window. It provides a seamless way for consumers to give feedback without disrupting the chat experience. This feature enables admins to gather targeted feedback to improve consumer satisfaction. \nZoom Revenue Accelerator\n\u00a0Updates \nSupport streamlined notification management: Admin control - \nZoom Revenue Accelerator admins can efficiently modify and manage all their Zoom Revenue Accelerator related notifications, whether email or in-product, using a centralized control hub. This functionality is accessible through the Notification Settings and, if enabled, allows users to conveniently adjust their notification settings on their personal settings page. This setting is available at the account and user level. This feature may not be immediately available as it is dependent on a web release. \nSupport for additional transcript language: Arabic -\n Language support for multilingual transcription is expanding to include Arabic. The newly supported language is currently in beta. Conversation metrics, Screen Text, and Call Outs, such as Indicators, Next Steps, and Good Questions, are currently supported in beta for this additional language. \nWorkspace Reservation\n\u00a0Updates \nIntroducing Wayfinding -\n Account owners and admins can set up wayfinding to guide users from the office entrance to their desks or meeting rooms. Users can view directions on their mobile devices, desktop app, and kiosks. \nAutomatically check users into workspace reservations when connecting to office WiFi - \nAccount owners and admins can enable a setting to automatically check users into their workspace reservation when their Zoom client detects they have connected to the office WiFi. This allows account owners and admins to more accurately track workspace utilization without users needing to remember to manually check-in. This setting requires account owners and admins to configure the office WiFi details at each location so Zoom clients can detect when a user is connected. When enabled, users will receive an alert when they are automatically checked in upon connecting to the office WiFi. \nZoom Whiteboard\n\u00a0Updates \nSupport for Whiteboard Projects in tablet and mobile -\n Users can now access and create Whiteboard Projects in tablet and mobile apps without joining a meeting. This allows users to contribute to specific projects, access shared content, and maintain organized workflows. The addition of mobile and tablet support makes whiteboard collaboration more flexible, enhancing productivity across devices. \nZoom Virtual Agent\n\u00a0Updates\nSupport for knowledge base AI-generated queries - \nZoom Virtual Agent admins can opt in to AI-generated queries to help jump start knowledge base coaching. This feature leverages AI to generate queries based on knowledge base content. This allows knowledge base admins to efficiently train the system to align with specific company content. It is recommended that admins select the most frequently used articles to optimize efficiency. Once selected, admins can review the AI-generated queries and the best answers recommended by the model, change to a new answer, delete, or coach.\u00a0 \nEnhancements to video URL functionality in bot flows - \nAdmins can easily embed video in bot flows by entering a URL, rather than needing to download and upload a file. For supported sites like YouTube, Vimeo, and Dailymotion, the video title and thumbnail are automatically populated. Admins can override the title if needed. For other sites, admins can manually enter a title and upload a thumbnail image. Users can play the videos directly within the chat . This enhancement simplifies the process of adding engaging video content to bot flows. \nService Announcements \nZoom Software Lifecycle Policy - \nWe plan to enforce the next round of our Software Lifecycle Policy on May 4, 2024, for all products and services, starting with the minimum versions referenced in the table found \nhere\n. Users running an end-of-life version after May 4 will not be able to join meetings via the Zoom Client and will be prompted to update or join from the Web browser. As always, we highly recommend you regularly download and update to the latest version of Zoom software by checking for updates within the Zoom desktop client or by navigating to \nzoom.us/download\n\u00a0to take advantage of all our latest security and functionality features.\u00a0\u00a0\n\u00a0\nHappy Zooming,\nZoom Success Advisor\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\nYou're receiving this email because you are a Zoom customer.\nIf you wish to be removed from our email list, \nunsubscribe\n or \nmanage your email preferences.",
