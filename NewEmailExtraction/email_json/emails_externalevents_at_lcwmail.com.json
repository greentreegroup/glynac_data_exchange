With Disability Lead\u2019s support and active identification, its members strengthen disability representation in positions of power and influence, increasing equity, inclusion, and economic opportunity for all. Disability Lead\u2019s proven track record of shifting power to individuals who live at the intersection of marginalized identities demonstrates that people with disabilities are well-suited to tackle systemic problems that have the largest impacts on the most vulnerable. Founded in Chicago, other regions across the nation are attracted to its approach, and Disability Lead is now embarking on a new journey to replicate and expand the model.\n\u200a\n \nChicago Chefs Cook is a non-profit humanitarian organization serving as an unprecedented platform for chefs and restaurateurs to fundraise for humanitarian causes important to culinarians and their diners. The efforts of Chicago Chefs Cook extend the role of chefs in the Chicagoland area from purveyors of culture-rich culinary experiences to multi-dimensional civic leaders. In this way, the organization amplifies the sphere of impact that chefs uniquely create and unlocks deeper points of connectivity between chefs, diners, and community members. The result is a more invested city that shows up for each other, with chefs, and food, serving as the vital connective tissue that binds us all.\n\u200a\n \nWith the onset of COVID-19, Cook County partnered with the Illinois Manufacturing Excellence Center (IMEC) to conduct a historic outreach and census of suburban Cook County manufacturers to assess the pandemic\u2019s impact on their businesses. Manufacturing Reinvented utilizes technical assistance from IMEC to help manufacturers address these identified priorities. Eligible projects cover themes such as market growth, workforce training, operational improvements, and leadership, all aligned with survey results.\n\u200a\n \nCareers in technology have long been dominated by men: despite making up approximately half of the U.S. workforce, only around 29% of technology sector workers identify as female. With more than 4,000 students enrolled to date, the Women+Tech Scholars Program is designed to empower women pursuing careers in technology to reach their breakthrough moments. The program\u2019s educational offerings, resources, and professional networks help narrow employment and advancement gaps for women in tech-related roles. In addition to learning opportunities, scholars receive career guidance, financial support, and real-world work experience through a community of passionate advocates\u2014many of whom started in the same place as the learners today.\n\u200a\n \nHyperelastic Bone\u00ae represents a new generation of regenerative biomaterials that leverages a unique approach to restoring functionality in the body through a dynamic collaboration between biology and 3D-printed biomaterials. The first product made from this novel technology is CMFlex\u2122, a ready-to-use bone graft substitute and the first 3D-printed regenerative bone product cleared by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) for facial reconstruction applications. CMFlex offers a safe and effective alternative to traditional bone grafts\u2014one that can save valuable time during surgical procedures and transform the current standard of care.\n\u200a\n \nThe Springrose Mobility Bra\u2122 is the world\u2019s most versatile bra, thoughtfully designed for women who have limited mobility due to injury, illness, disability, or aging. For those who struggle with traditional bras, its innovative modular design offers over eight different ways to put it on \u2014 including one-handed, stepping in, or overhead \u2014 allowing women to dress painlessly, independently, and with dignity. Despite its innovative functionality, the Mobility Bra\u2122 remains stylish, comfortable, and pacemaker-safe, and is available in the most inclusive size range in the adaptive intimates category. With a granted utility and design patent from the USPTO and patents pending internationally, it redefines what\u2019s possible for apparel.\n\u200a\n \nTrue Star\u2019s innovative social enterprise tackles critical challenges by offering transformative education and hands-on training in media arts and digital marketing to local youth. Their comprehensive curriculum spans journalism, video production, digital marketing, and more, equipping local youth with the essential skills to thrive in the digital age. \n\u200a\n \nREACH Pathways bridges the opportunity gap for under-resourced learners by combining game-based learning with AI-powered tools to build leadership and career skills. REACH provides learners with personalized support, financial resources, and a community that drives success in education and careers. \n\u200a\n \nFounded in 2021, First Women\u2019s Bank is the only commercial bank in the country with a strategic focus on supporting the women\u2019s economy and closing the gender lending gap. To execute this mission, we recruit deposits from individuals, organizations, and corporations that share our vision. These funds are then strategically deployed to \ufb01nance small businesses, with a focus on supporting the women\u2019s economy. We recognize that small businesses are the backbone of our economy, and we are committed to providing the capital they need to succeed. Banking with FWB means becoming part of a community that deeply understands and is committed to growing the economy and the role of women within it.\nView all 2024 Chicago Innovation Award Winners\u00a0\n \n\u200a\n \nCelebrating the women of the Chicago Innovation team and \n\ufeff\nall the work they do for the innovation community\n \n \n \nRosalyn King \nVice President \u2014 Finance & Operations\nLaura Jordan LeClair\nDirector \u2014 Mentoring and Inclusion Programs\nAnna Aguiar Kosicki\nSenior Coordinator of Events and Programs\n \n \n \nMalak Mekha \nSocial Media Coordinator \nMolly Seedhouse\nDirector \u2014 Illinois Student Invention Convention \nGalyna Kravets\nGraphic Designer\n\u200a\n \n\u200a\n \nChicago Innovation Fellows Second Session\nOn February 25th, \nChicago Innovation Fellows gathered for an impactful second session.

    "subject": "Today's Leadership: What's Required?",
    "body": "Out & Equal\u2019s March 2025 Newsletter\n \n\u200a\n\u200a\nToday's Leadership: What's Required?\n\u00a0\nOut & Equal is less than two weeks away from hosting the \n2025 Leadership Forum\n. As we finalize our programming for Partners, our north star is: \nwhat will it take to lead in these unprecedented times?\n\u00a0\nFrom work teams and Employee Resource Groups (ERGs) or Business Resource Groups (BRGs), to an entire organization or community, leadership plays an integral role in:\u00a0\nsetting a vision and defining a compelling and community-centered path forward where no one is left behind;\u00a0\nlistening, validating, and meeting people where they are to hear and acknowledge concerns\u2013even when you might not have clear answers; and\u00a0\nbuilding cultures of trust and support where mistakes are acknowledged, learned from, and tackled together.\u00a0\nWhen any of these areas begin to lag, especially in times when there are other stressors or confusion, that is when challenges and gaps develop, and profound fear can exacerbate.\u00a0\nSo, in this age when there is so much turmoil and so much at stake, where do we go from here? How can leaders instill confidence, trust, and support? What does leadership need to look like today?\u00a0\nAuthenticity, transparency, and inclusion are key. \nPeople are looking for leaders who speak truth and admit mistakes or knowledge gaps, level set and take a commonsense approach to issues, and build cultures that foster inclusion, which tap into the potential of us all.\u00a0\n \nBe bold and empathetic. \nBeing an effective leader means having the support to realize your vision. Meeting people where they are, acknowledging their experiences, and bringing them on a journey\u2014as opposed to pushing them down a path\u2014builds trust and respect all while yielding better business results.\u00a0\u00a0\n \nRemain mission-focused. \nBe disciplined in remaining focused on your highest goals and opportunities ahead. Do not let the immediacy of the current storm cloud your judgement and decision-making. Stay focused, remain committed to your values, support your teams, and keep pushing forward.\u00a0\n \nIn these times of upheaval, effective, strong, and inclusive leadership is the most strategic formula to uplift individuals, teams, and entire organizations. It instills confidence, hope, and trust. It reminds people that they matter and someone, through the hardships and victories, has their back.\u00a0\nAt Out & Equal, that is the type of leadership we bring to the table to our more than 330 Partner organizations. We serve as confidantes, thought partners, and strategic advisors. We\u2019re there to work in true partnership to improve workplaces, optimize culture, and advance their business, talent and culture objectives.\u00a0\nTo all the leaders out there, emerging and seasoned, here is my closing message to you all: keep listening, keep learning, and keep growing. Remember your north star. And remember the power of community. As a CEO, I am inspired by all of you building, in partnership with us, towards the Business of Belonging. \u00a0\n\u00a0\n \n \n \n \nCelebrating Women\u2019s History Month: Firsts Are Essential. Seconds Are Critical. Movements Must Be Intentional.\n\u00a0\nAs we kick off Women\u2019s History Month, it\u2019s key we acknowledge the challenges all\u00a0\nwomen\u2014particularly Queer women, transgender women, and women of color\u2014have and continue to face in the workplace and beyond.\u00a0\nTo ensure the growth and success of our teams, organizations, and communities, we must invest in all women. We must create inclusive spaces where their voices are heard and amplified. We must acknowledge, recognize, and respect their unique experiences and identities. And we must address our own biases and show up as authentic allies. \nNow more than ever, allies\u2013especially if you are a \u201cfirst\u201d to anyone around you or looking up to you\n\u2013\nmust pull people in and up, so that we can keep walking forward together as a community and build firsts and seconds into a movement.\nRead More\n \n\u200a\n\u200a\nRecognizing, Honoring, and Celebrating Transgender Day of Visibility (March 31)\nTransgender and nonbinary people have made our communities and society stronger with contributions that have shaped business, technology, and culture. Across movements and moments, the community has pushed the cause of equality forward for all people.\u00a0\n\u00a0\nAs transgender and nonbinary people face systemic attacks, discrimination, and erasure, allies and the broader LGBTQ+ community have common ground to stand up for and alongside our transgender and nonbinary community authentically and intentionally.\u00a0\n\u00a0\nOn Transgender Day of Visibility and beyond, what can you do to support the community and elevate the conversation?\nFamiliarize yourself with transgender history and transgender heroes in our movement. \nLearn about who they are and \nhow they have made our\u00a0world a better, stronger place\n.\n\u00a0\n \nBe an authentic ally.

    "body": "The New Executive Playbook\nView in browser\nDear Ashton,\n\u00a0\nAs organizations face economic uncertainty, AI-driven transformation, and shifting workforce expectations, one challenge remains constant: how to develop leaders who can navigate complexity and drive business success.\nFor senior learning and talent leaders, ensuring executives have the right mix of financial acumen, strategic agility, and AI fluency is critical. The latest research highlights three key leadership shifts that learning and development (L&D) leaders should prioritize in their executive education strategies.\n\u00a0\nThree Critical Shifts Defining Leadership in 2025\n\ud83d\udccc \nPricing Strategy as a Leadership Competency\nAccording to Forbes, companies that leverage data-driven pricing strategies achieve higher profitability and customer loyalty. As organizations invest in leadership development, training executives in behavioral economics, AI-driven pricing models, and value-based decision-making will be a competitive advantage.\nRead More:\n \nForbes \u2013 The CEO\u2019s Guide to Pricing\n\u00a0\n\ud83d\udccc \nReimagining Finance Strategy for Business Agility\nThe ability to think strategically about financial decisions is no longer limited to CFOs. HR, L&D, and business leaders need to understand finance at a high level to support growth, workforce investments, and long-term planning. For L&D leaders, this means ensuring executives and high-potential talent are equipped with the financial literacy to connect business strategy with financial decision-making.\nRead More:\n \nGartner \u2013 How to Create a Better Finance Strategy\n\u00a0\n\ud83d\udccc \nAI is Reshaping Leadership\u2014Are Executives Prepared?\nAI adoption is accelerating, but most organizations lack leaders who understand how to integrate AI into workforce strategies. McKinsey research shows that while 70% of companies are increasing AI investments, only a fraction are developing leaders who can harness AI to drive productivity and innovation. Talent leaders must prioritize executive education that develops AI literacy, human-AI collaboration skills, and digital transformation strategies to future-proof their workforce.\nRead More:\n \nMcKinsey \u2013 Empowering People to Unlock AI\u2019s Full Potential\n\u00a0\nHow Learning & Talent Leaders Are Preparing Their Workforces\nTo navigate these challenges, leading organizations are rethinking their leadership development strategies and investing in executive education programs that equip leaders with financial, strategic, and AI-driven decision-making skills.\n\u00a0\nFrom Our Sponsor:\n\u00a0\nChicago Booth Executive Education\n is at the forefront of \nhelping organizations build resilient, forward-thinking leadership pipelines.\n Programs focused on \npricing strategy, financial decision-making, and digital innovation\n empower executives with the tools needed to lead effectively in today\u2019s complex business landscape.\n\u00a0\n\ud83d\udce5 \nDownload the 2025 Executive Education Catalog\n to explore how organizations are developing leaders for the future. \nAccess the Catalog\n\u00a0\nBest,\n \nAshley St. John\nEditor in Chief\nChief Learning Officer\nCopyright \u00a9 2025 BetterWork Media Group | All rights reserved.\n\u00a0\nReproduction in whole or in part in any form or medium without written permission of BetterWork Media Group is prohibited.\n\u00a0\nBetterWork Media Group, Publisher of Chief Learning Officer & Chief Talent Officer\n\u00a0\n\u00a01 E.

    "subject": "Fair360: Where We're Going",
    "body": "Dear Ashton,\n\u00a0\nI changed the name of my company from DiversityInc to Fair360 two years ago. I saw the anti-DEI movement coming. It's OK, progress requires adaptation and innovation. Change is necessary when, as one example, you have a system where women have earned more than half of bachelor's and master's degree since the 1980s (and earned more than half of PhDs since the 1990s). Despite this, women are only 10% of Fortune 500 CEOs.\n\u00a0\nFocusing on Outcomes\nWe have moved away from representation to outcomes. Outcomes are expressed for every demographic. This year, we provided every company with a monetary value of their inclusive human resources initiatives - expressed as existing (dollar value) benefit and opportunity (if management of initiatives was improved to that of top-performing companies).\n\u00a0\nFairness Report Insights\nWe also provided a fairness report, which conclusively showed that white people are not systematically discriminated against even in companies that had the most robust inclusion initiatives. This is critical. The progress of some cannot come at the penalty of others. The perception that it does is at the root of much anti-DEI sentiment. That said, individual cases of discrimination against white people (and every other group) cannot be denied. No company can absolutely guard itself against the intentional misbehavior of individuals.\n\u00a0\nOptimized Survey\nOur survey has been optimized to be more efficient, now containing fewer than 100 questions. We have removed compensation-related inquiries and made supplier outreach and philanthropy optional, ensuring a more focused and relevant experience for participants.\n\u00a0\nData-Driven Analysis\nAt the core of our work is data-driven analysis that helps companies quantify the impact of their inclusion efforts. Voluntary turnover, a key indicator of workplace equity, varies significantly across industries\u2014sometimes by a factor of four. This presents an astonishing competitive advantage\u2014or disadvantage. Our data demonstrates that higher turnover is linked to increased bias, making it a critical metric for organizations to monitor given the increasing diversity of workforce demographics.\n\u00a0\nRefined Benchmarking Approach\nTo help organizations drive measurable progress, we are refining our benchmarking approach, focusing on five key inclusion initiatives: mentorship, sponsorship, high potentials, employee resource groups (ERGs) and executive HR councils. These areas have been identified in our data as essential for improving the quality of recruitment, retention and development.\u00a0\n\u00a0\nCommitment to Verified Meritocracy\nAs workplace dynamics continue to evolve, we are adopting the language of \u201cmeritocracy\u201d to reinforce our commitment to fairness and equity across all employee groups. This holistic approach ensures that inclusion efforts are assessed comprehensively. In alignment with this direction, we have secured the domains meritocracy360.com and verifiedmeritocracy.com and are restructuring our online presence accordingly.\n\u00a0\nFlagship Event in NYC\nOur flagship event at Cipriani\u2019s Wall Street in New York City on May 6 will reflect this refined strategy. Moving away from rankings and company callouts, the event will focus on mentorship, talent development and real-world learning opportunities. With a special emphasis on first-generation college students, the event will provide mentorship, interviews and discussions on essential topics such as financial literacy, equipping the next generation with the skills they need for long-term success.\n\u00a0\nThrough these strategic refinements, we remain committed to delivering data-driven insights, promoting inclusive business practices and fostering a representative pipeline of future leaders.\n\u00a0\nTake the Survey\nI encourage you to \nfill out our survey\n. There is no deadline. It will be open all year. You will receive a \nfree report card\n that will give you a monetary value of your current efforts, and opportunity value of improving your efforts. This is an editorial process, thus protected by New Jersey's shield law. We have not been compelled to comply with a single subpoena since we started to collect data in 2003. There will be no public rankings, but you will receive a private ranking, if interested.\n\u00a0\nFinal Thoughts\nIn closing, my advice to everyone is to ground your work in monetary value, described in absolute terms. You cannot lose a shareholder agreement that way. A boss once told me that \"beliefs\" have no place in business because a \"belief\" is an acceptance of an intangible. Business is tangible. If you want to be relevant, be tangible.\n\u00a0\nThank you,\n\u00a0\nLuke Visconti, \nFounder and Chairman, \nFair360\nFair360, is a VA-certified and veteran-owned business., It is certified by Disability:IN as a company owned by a person with a disability., \nhttps://www.fair360.com/\n, \u00a9 Copyright 2024 Fair360 \nUnsubscribe\n \nManage preferences",

    "body": "Out & Equal\u2019s February 2025 Newsletter\n \n\u200a\n\u200a\nReflecting on Our New Landscape\n\u00a0\nIt has been about three weeks since a new administration came to power in the United States. In that short period of time, through executive orders and actions, political appointments, and rhetoric, we have seen an agenda centered on tactics\u2014exclusion, othering, and fear\u2014that run counter to the interests of individuals, businesses, and communities.\nThroughout my career, from consultancy to my role as CEO of Out & Equal today, I\u2019ve experienced the ebbs and flows of political, economic, and societal changes and their impacts on people, organizations, and everyday life. But through it all, here is what has always been constant: a desire to make us all stronger by expanding access to opportunity and leading with principles like inclusion and belonging.\nWe are in the midst of a concerted effort to roll back protections for the most marginalized and underserved, establish new norms that seek to further divide and isolate, and institutionalize disinformation.\nAt Out & Equal, our commitment to the Business of Belonging remains strong. We are:\nEngaging with leaders:\n\u202f\nActively participating in coalition meetings and conducting strategic meetings with company CEOs and their top leadership to provide them support in their workforce and stakeholder responsiveness.\n \nIntegrating Virtual Workplace Summit learnings\n:\u202f\nIncorporating the valuable lessons and community-building experiences from our recent Virtual Summit into our ongoing programs and initiatives.\n \nEmpowering Employee Resource Group (ERG) leaders\n:\u202f\nSharpening and expanding our resources and support materials specifically designed to equip and empower ERG leaders to effectively navigate and address these challenging times.\u00a0\n \nBeyond, what our organizations can do, we all have an individual role to play. So, what can you do? To answer that question, we must look to our past in order to chart our path forward.\nNow is the time to draw strength and inspiration from the pioneers and everyday heroes who came before us. As we celebrate, honor, and recognize Black History Month, I can\u2019t help but think of individuals like Bayard Rustin, Marsha P. Johnson, Barbara Jordan, and so many more, who through immense challenge and struggle, kept pushing for justice and equality. And through those efforts, they not only advanced those causes for themselves and their communities but for us all.\nIt\u2019s not lost on me that the immense progress we have made has been the result of the most marginalized and those under the greatest threat\u2014transgender, nonbinary, and people of color\u2014demanding and fighting for change. Individuals like Bayard, Marsha, and Barbara knew that one group\u2019s loss of freedom, justice, equality, and dignity, impacted all of society.\nIn these next weeks, months, and years, we cannot tune out or disengage. We must stay active and connected. We must use our power and sphere of influence to hold ourselves, our friends and family, and our leaders accountable. So, stay informed. Engage in the hard conversations. Ensure your organizations continue to build inclusive and welcoming workplaces. Find community.\nWe must not and cannot stop fighting for the principles and ideals of equality, inclusion, and belonging for all.\nQuite simply, it\u2019s not only the right thing to do but it will make us all\u2014our communities, our businesses, and our society\u2014stronger.\nI know that is what I and Out & Equal are committed to.\n \n \n \n \nThe LGBTQ+ Community is Not a Monolith: Celebrating & Honoring Black History Month\nAs our CEO, Erin Uritus, has stated, it\u2019s critical we recognize the unique, and near insurmountable, challenges faced by Black Queer people in the workplace and beyond. Challenges like the systemic barriers that can block opportunity and equal justice. Challenges to being safe in one\u2019s own community.\n\ufeff\nAnd despite the challenges, the risks, and the loss, trailblazers, icons, and everyday individuals have pushed forward to advance causes, communities, and movements. They have done this in the face of adversities that other people have not, do not, and will not face.\nIt\u2019s a reminder of the immense resilience of this community. Organizations cannot and must not overlook the Black Queer community. They have shaped societies and culture as we know it, and their contributions will only continue to drive meaningful change that help organizations, communities, and society thrive.\nRead More\n \n\u200a\n\u200a\nBuilding Community Year-Round\n\u00a0\nOur Virtual Summit programming was just the beginning of what will be an impactful year of community and convening.\nOut & Equal is heading across the US and the globe to engage with our Partners at roundtables, forums, and symposiums. In these convenings, we'll be discussing of-the-moment issues and helping Partners develop strategies to advance LGBTQ+ workplace equality, inclusion, and belonging through a regional and local lens.\nDon't forget to register now for our Partner-exclusive events!\n \n\ufeff\n\ufeff\n2025 London Symposium: Shaping the Future of LGBTQ+ Workplace Inclusion\nFriday, February 28\nLondon, England, UK\n \n \n\ufeff\n2025 Out & Equal Leadership Forum\nMonday, March 17-Wednesday, March 19\nOxon Hill, Maryland, USA\nPlease be sure to reference the \nOut & Equal Events Calendar\n, which is updated on a regular basis.\nFor any questions regarding our convenings and how to access them, please reach out to\u00a0\npartnerships@outandequal.org\n.\n\u200a\n \nRegister for the 2025 Out & Equal Leadership Forum\nFor more than 15 years, Out & Equal has convened more than 3,000 executives, ascending leaders, practitioners, and allies through a one-of-a-kind, Partner-exclusive gathering created to provide unique networking and timely learning opportunities.\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\nLeadership Forum, taking place from \nMarch 17-19\n, is a moment to break through the noise and focus on the insights, learnings, and connections that will deliver measurable and lasting progress for you, your teams, and your organization.\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\nA curated agenda featuring highly customized program tracks will engage and empower change agents at all levels while clearly reinforcing the value of inclusion and belonging in driving key business strategies forward.\n\u00a0\nRegister Now\n \n\u200a\n\u200a\nWe Need Your Insights and Experiences!\n\u00a0\nWe know that ERGs play a vital role in advancing workplace inclusion and belonging.

Following the difficult but necessary decision to cancel the in-person event, Out & Equal reimagined Summit and created brand new-content as part of a pivot to hybrid Summit programming with virtual and in-person elements spanning the end of 2024 and into the start of 2025.\n\u00a0\nLast month, members of the Out & Equal Partner came together for three days of powerful conversations, community-building and networking opportunities, and engaging sessions that left attendees with actionable insights and learnings to advance inclusion and belonging in their organizations.\n\ufeff\nReminder! \nYou can continue exploring Summit sessions and resources on-demand on the Out & Equal app and \nVirtual Platform\n through \nApril 25, 2025\n.\n\u200a\n\u200a\nWelcome to our New Partners!\nAt Out & Equal, we work with the world's leading and most influential companies\u2014and the inclusive leaders at these organizations\u2014to advance LGBTQ+ inclusion and belonging in the workplace.\u00a0\u00a0\n\u00a0\nWe\u2019re proud to welcome \nBrown & Brown\n and \nValley National Bank\n \nas our newest members of the Out & Equal Partner Community.\n \n\u200a\n\u200a\nPartner in the Business of Belonging\u2122\nThrough thought leadership and partnership (advisory services, knowledge, resources, and tools) and global programs and transformative events, becoming an Out & Equal Partner will supercharge your LGBTQ+ workplace inclusion progress.\nWe look forward to having you join us in the movement!\nLearn More\n \n\u200a\nFOLLOW US\n \u00a0\n \u00a0\n \u00a0\n \u00a0\n \n\u200a\noutandequal.org\nOut & Equal | \n1111 Broadway\n 3rd Floor | \nOakland, CA 94607 US\nUnsubscribe\n | \nUpdate Profile\n | \nConstant Contact Data Notice",

    "body": "Out & Equal\u2019s January 2025 Newsletter\n \n\u200a\n\u200a\nPreparing for the Future\nAs we start the New Year and prepare to see a new administration come to power in the United States, I\u2019m thinking of these words from Dr. Martin Luther King Jr., \n\u201cChange does not roll in on the wheels of inevitability but comes through continuous struggle. And so, we must straighten our backs and work for our freedom.\u201d\n\u00a0\u00a0\n\u00a0\u00a0\nI began my tenure as Out & Equal\u2019s CEO on Martin Luther King Jr. Day in 2018. The crosscurrents of the day\u2013service, solemnity for all of the lives lost in the pursuit of a more just future, and the hope of what organizations like Out & Equal inspire around the world\u2013were pulsing through me as I got to work.\u00a0\u00a0\n\u00a0\nJust weeks into my start, we witnessed the tragic shooting at Parkland High School. In the devastating aftermath, we saw the resilience of the human spirit and tragedy turn into action. From classrooms to board rooms, young high school organizers and CEOs declared, we must be better as a society. We must speak up like our lives and our children\u2019s lives depend on it.\u00a0\n\u00a0\nWhen adversity is its most acute, when the stakes are high enough, real leaders emerge. It was in this moment in 2018 that a new voice grew. Companies and their leaders took stock of their own power and decided to speak up and leverage their spheres of influence for change. This was not politically motivated \u2013 or popular. It was both the right thing to do and smart business. The CEOs I admire most look beyond the immediate headlines and short-term trends to the long game of how inclusion is built, sustained, and translated into durable plans for the future\u2013to cultures of \nbelonging\n.\u00a0\u00a0\n\u00a0\nAround that time, Out and Equal pivoted into the Business of Belonging\u2013our unique approach to holistic culture optimization that is focused on the unique strengths and challenges of LGBTQ+ professionals, as well as intersectional allyship across identities and experience. And maybe most important of all, we connected our Partners together in an active and engaged community of change practitioners. No one must reinvent the wheel or spend unnecessary time on a learning curve. We all help each other make talent attraction and retention as effective as it needs to be in a multi-cultural environment that is only getting more diverse, facing ever more complex business challenges.\u00a0\u00a0\n\u00a0\nThe year ahead won\u2019t be easy. Undoubtedly, it will be filled with challenges and uncertainty, with LGBTQ+ rights and progress being questioned and attacked. But here is what I know to be true: through it all, our community will keep pushing forward.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\n\u00a0\u00a0\nThere is no other choice, and we know no other way. We've faced challenges before, and they have only strengthened our resolve. Through setback and celebration, adversity has fueled our movement for equality. And now, when there is so much at stake, it must also sharpen our focus and prompt our creativity. We are forged from fire, joy, pain and freedom. This is not just lip service to \u201cresilience\u201d\u2013this will be resilience with purpose, a deep knowing of who we are and what we can do when we do it together.\n \n \n\u200a\nRecognizing & Celebrating Mentorship Month\nThe start of a New Year, which aligns with \nMentoring Month\n,\n is an ideal time to think about how we can be more intentional, inclusive, and impactful in the work we do. Mentorship, sponsorship, and coaching all play an integral role in optimizing workplace cultures and creating opportunities for all individuals to thrive.\nWhile the benefits of mentorship are immense to enhancing talent strategies, creating more inclusive cultures, and advancing key business objectives, in research conducted by Out & Equal, we found that \nonly 10% of LGBTQ+ people\n report that their organizations have an LGBTQ+-specific mentorship program.\nThis year, leaders and organizations should take the opportunity to develop comprehensive mentorship programs that reach the entirety of their workforce.\u00a0\u00a0\nTo get you and your organization started on this journey, Out & Equal has a resource outlining the differences between mentorship, sponsorship, and coaching, their value, and examples of how our Partners have implemented successful programs.\n\ufeff\nRead More\n \n\u200a\n\u200a\nWe Need Your Insights and Experiences!\n\u00a0\nWe know that ERGs play a vital role in advancing workplace inclusion and belonging. It's why \nOut & Equal is conducting a short survey, \nMeeting the Moment: Illuminating the Path Forward for Employee Resource Groups\n,\n that we will use to inform future ERG-related programming, offerings, and content.\n\ufeffWe would love to know more about your experiences with your company or organization's LGBTQ+ Employee Resource Group, Business Resource Group, Affinity Group, or equivalent. We appreciate your contributions as we aim to produce relevant, cutting-edge content that helps to create environments where everyone can thrive.\nTake the Survey\n \n \n\ufeff\n\"At Out & Equal, we\u2019re looking to expand our ERG suite of support to better serve ERG leaders, Executive Champions, and DEI staff.

I proudly voted and I sincerely hope everyone with the ability to has or will cast their ballots for our country and for our future. \n\u00a0\nThe stakes are so high for the LGBTQ+ community and for equality-at-large.\n\u00a0\nAs we await the results, know this. Regardless of the outcome of this election, the strength and power of the LGBTQ+ community will not change and our mission at Out & Equal will not change. We will remain focused on building businesses of belonging.\n\u00a0\nWe will sharpen and hone our services to ensure your internal change agents, who are charged with doing this critical work in an ever-more complicated landscape, will have the tools and resources they need. We will continue to be a resource for leaders and a convener of community.\n\u00a0\nNo matter what, we will keep pushing forward.\n \n \n \nReimagining Workplace Summit\n\u00a0\nLast month, in response to Hurricane Milton, we made the difficult but necessary decision to cancel the in-person component of this year\u2019s Workplace Summit in Orlando, Florida.\nWe know how much this event means to our community, and we too, felt the disappointment of not being able to come together in-person.\nWhile we were unable to convene, we did have an opportunity to capture powerful speeches from our Board Chair, Allyn L. Shaw (he/him), and our CEO, Erin Uritus (she/her).\nIn a moment of uncertainty, their remarks reinforce our community\u2019s ability to meet any moment and persevere.\n \n\u200a\n \nThis content is only the beginning. As delivered in a call last week to our Partner community, Out & Equal has rolled out an exciting pivot to a \u201cVirtual Summit\u201d that lifts up curated premier sessions, fireside chats, and new resources from what would have taken place in Orlando.\nWe have already convened hundreds of Summit attendees in a series of \u201cIlluminate Belonging\u201d sessions and we are hosting our fifteen Community Engagement Groups (CEGs) that are bringing together LGBTQ+ professionals and allies from across our more than 330 Partner network between now and January.\n\ufeff\nThen, in a capstone moment during the week of January 13th, Out & Equal will convene the entire Workplace Summit attendee community (5,000+) over two days for exciting live learning, discussions, and community engagement. Most importantly, if you are an employee at an Out & Equal Partner company and were not slotted to attend Summit, Out & Equal is creating learning and discussion guides that will support your representatives in bringing back this learning to you in new and exciting Employee Resource Group (ERG) programming.\nWe're excited for what's in store and are confident this learning content will help our Partners advance inclusion and belonging in their workplace.\u00a0\n\u200a\n \n \nOn Transgender Day of Remembrance, we acknowledge and remember the lives of transgender individuals who have been tragically lost due to violence and discrimination.\n\u00a0\u00a0\nAnd while we mourn those who are no longer with us, we must also recognize the strength and resilience of the transgender community, which in the face of immense adversity and danger, continues to be on the front lines of advancing equality for all.\n\ufeff\nThis day is a poignant reminder that we all play a role in building a future where every individual, regardless of gender identity, can live freely without fear and thrive.\n\u200a\n\u200a\nOut & Equal in the News\nOur CEO, Erin Uritus:\u00a0\nPenned an op-ed with Bob Witeck, President of Witeck Communications, Inc., for \nFast Company\n on why inclusion and belonging, from talent to brand loyalty and the bottom line, remain business imperatives.\u00a0\n \nWrote a byline for \nThe Advocate\n on National Coming Out Day about her own journey and how corporate leaders can ensure their building spaces of belonging where their LGBTQ+ employees can thrive.\u00a0\n \nJean-Marie Navetta (she/ella), Out & Equal\u2019s Vice President of Learning Programs, was featured along several other luminaries and influencers in OUT\u2019s \u201c\nComing Out, Me\n\u201d series.\u00a0\u00a0\n\u200a\n\u200a\nSupport Out & Equal on Giving Tuesday \nDecember 3\nEveryone should be able to show up to work as their complete and authentic self.

    "body": "Out & Equal\u2019s October 2024 Newsletter\n \n\u200a\n\u200a\nReflecting on Our Past and Building Towards Our Future\nThe journey towards LGBTQ+ justice, equality, and inclusion, has never been easy. We\u2019ve faced countless challenges, naysayers, and setbacks. But, with the support of our allies, we\u2019ve persevered.\nOver the last two decades, we\u2019ve achieved what once seemed impossible: workplace protections, marriage equality, greater representation across every major platform, and a shift in hearts and minds towards greater acceptance and inclusion of our community.\nAs we celebrate LGBTQ+ History Month, it\u2019s important we remember our progress and our accomplishments. They remind us how strong our community can be and renew us for the important work ahead.\nToday, extremists are (still) pushing for anti-LGBTQ+ legislation. A handful of companies have made short-sighted decisions to pull back on diversity, equity, and inclusion. But here\u2019s what I know: The future is ours.\nWith each generation, our workforce and our society are becoming more Queer. One in five Gen Z adults identifies as LGBTQ+. We\u2019re flexing our economic muscle, with LGBTQ+ purchasing power in the US estimated at $1.4 trillion. And our workplaces are becoming more inclusive, with 91% of Fortune 500 companies prohibiting workplace discrimination based on sexual orientation.\nThe winds of progress remain at our back. Let\u2019s always remember that together, we\u2019re powerful. Together, we can build a future centered on inclusion and belonging. Together, no one can stop us.\u00a0\u00a0\n \n \n \nToday, we are launching the official Out & Equal CEO Instagram account. \n\ufeff\nBe sure to follow Erin Uritus \n@ceo_outandequal\n for her reflections on the moment we're in, the work and impact of Out & Equal, and how together, we will keeping push forward.\n\u200a\n \nThroughout the month of October, we\u2019re proud to celebrate and acknowledge the following:\n\u00a0\nLGBTQ+ History Month (October)\nThe history of the LGBTQ+ community is rich with joy and grief. Through the ups and downs, the history-making victories and the challenges that tested our resolve, our collective community has become stronger, showing that we are an unstoppable force. This month, we honor the trailblazers, activists, leaders, and everyday heroes who have paved the way for LGBTQ+ rights and equality.\nInternational Lesbian Day (October 8)\nWe are proud to celebrate the lesbian community and its strength, diversity, and beauty. Today and every day, we acknowledge the integral role it has, is, and will continue to play in advancing LGBTQ+ equality.\n\u00a0\nNational Coming Out Day (October 11)\nWhether you are out and proud or your journey is just beginning, know that you are loved, seen, and valid. To those who are navigating their journey and determining how to share their stories at work, we encourage you to read our resource, \nYour Story. Your Truth. Your Power\n.\nInternational Pronouns Day (October 16)\nUsing someone\u2019s correct pronouns is a simple and important way to show respect and affirm and validate someone\u2019s identity. For tips on pronoun inclusion in the workplace, \nread this resource from Out & Equal\n.\nSpirit Day (October 17)\nStand up, stand for, and stand with LGBTQ+ youth by going purple for Spirit Day! While more young people are identifying as LGBTQ+, they still face adversity and hardship On Spirit Day and year-round, we must show our support for LGBTQ+ youth and take a stand against bullying in all of its forms.\nAsexual Awareness Week (October 22-28)\nFor too long, the asexual community has experienced a lack of representation while being subjected to micro-agressions and questions and comments that invalidate and isolate. That must end. This week and beyond, let\u2019s celebrate, elevate, and recognize the asexual community. Let\u2019s take time to educate ourselves about their experiences and become allies in community.\nIntersex Awareness Day (October 26)\nDid you know that the global population of people who are intersex is larger than the entire nation of Japan? Despite the prevalence of intersex variation, too few employers have resources to understand the \u201cI\u201d in LGBTQI inclusion. It\u2019s why we partnered with interACT Advocates for Youth to release a \nguide on supporting intersex inclusion in the workplace\n.\n\ufeff\n \n\ufeff\nAt Out & Equal, we understand the importance of bringing your true and authentic self to all aspects of your life.\nIt's why we are and always will be committed to...\u00a0\u00a0\nRadiating Pride and Queer joy.\u00a0\u00a0\nCreating inclusive environments where \nall\n individuals can thrive.\u00a0\n \nAnd advancing LGBTQ+ inclusion and belonging in the workplace and beyond.\u00a0\u00a0\nWhether you\u2019re out and proud or your journey is just beginning, know that we stand with you. You are valid. You are seen.\n\u00a0\nAlways embrace and celebrate who you are. Never forget that your truth is your power. And always remember\u2014you are never alone on this journey.\nOn October 11, upload a brief message to your social channels, tag Out & Equal, and use #NationalComingOutDay.\n\u200a\n\u200a\nRecognizing World Mental Health Day on October 10\n\u00a0\nOn World Mental Health Day and beyond, let\u2019s acknowledge the importance of identifying and creating safe and inclusive spaces where we can reach out, talk, and seek help when needed.\nRemember, you\u2019re never alone on your journey and there are helpful mental health resources dedicated to the LGBTQ+ community including Trans Lifeline, The Trevor Project, and the LGBT National Hotline.\nIf you\u2019re struggling, help is available 24 hours a day by dialing 988 to the Suicide & Crisis Lifeline.\n\u200a\n\u200a\nOut & Equal in the News\nOur CEO, Erin Uritus:\u00a0\nIs featured in a \nUSA Today piece\n about the current DEI landscape and the value of inclusion and belonging.\n \nSits down with Rhodes Perry (he/him) for his \nImagine Belonging at Work podcast\n where they discuss her personal and professional journey, the impact of Out & Equal, and the business case for LGBTQ+ inclusion.\n \nPens \na byline for The Advocate\n on the value of bi+ inclusion in the workplace. \nSits down with \nthe Forged in Fire podcast\n to discuss her personal journey, leadership style, and how the experiences of an LGBTQ+ individual impact their approach to leadership.\n \n\u200a\n\u200a\nJoin the Out & Equal Community\n\u200a\nThrough thought leadership and partnership (advisory services, knowledge, resources, and tools) and global programs and transformative events, becoming an Out & Equal Partner will supercharge your LGBTQ+ workplace inclusion progress. \nWe look forward to having you join us in the movement! \nPartner in the Business of Belonging\u2122\nLearn More\n \n\u200a\nFOLLOW US\n \u00a0\n \u00a0\n \u00a0\n \n\u200a\noutandequal.org\nOut & Equal | \n1111 Broadway\n 3rd Floor | \nOakland, CA 94607 US\nUnsubscribe\n | \nUpdate Profile\n | \nConstant Contact Data Notice",

We\u2019re putting the final touches on our learning sessions, community-building activities, and unforgettable keynotes\u2014and the entire organization is buzzing with anticipation.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\n\u00a0\u00a0\nFor me, the planning process is a reflective one. From first-time attendee in 2001, to Out & Equal Board member and now CEO, I\u2019ve had the unique honor of experiencing Workplace Summit from many different vantage points.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\n\u00a0\u00a0\nBut one thing has remained consistent: Summit\u2019s ability to remind us that we, as individuals and a collective, have the power to create movement-making impact. The magic of Summit is unique and multifaceted. Why? Because it connects learning and best practices to action, it reminds us why we do this work, and it builds\u2014year after year\u2014community that sustains us.\u00a0\u00a0\n\u00a0\u00a0\nIn this complex, sometimes overwhelming landscape, I implore you to pause, breathe, and remember your power. Each of us has an individual sphere of influence that can spark a thought, discussion, or decision with an impact that extends far beyond our social and professional circles.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\n\u00a0\nSo, don\u2019t let inflammatory rhetoric and sensationalized news headlines dim your light and make you feel that your voice and effort can\u2019t make a difference. That\u2019s simply not true.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\n\u00a0\u00a0\nOur creativity, our imagination, and our desire to create a more just, inclusive world, can help us do what might feel impossible.\u00a0We can transform despair into hope, awareness to action, and stagnation to progress.\u00a0\u00a0\n\u00a0\u00a0\nWith all the work that we are doing at Out & Equal to advance LGBTQ+ equity, inclusion, and belonging in the workplace, I know I\u2019m ready to keep pushing forward\u2014at Summit, and beyond. Are you?\u00a0\u00a0\n \n \n\u200a\n\u200a\n \nRegistration for the 2024 Out & Equal Workplace Summit \n\ufeff\nCloses Tomorrow, September 6\n\u00a0\nRegister Now!\n \n\u200a\n\u200a\nRepresentation & Recognition Matter! \n\ufeff\nMeet Our Outie Award Finalists.\nSince its inception more than 20 years ago, Out & Equal has recognized more than 100 individuals, organizational practices, and ERGs across a range of categories whose work is proven to have advanced LGBTQ+ workplace equity and belonging for all.\nThis year\u2019s finalists represent an impressive group of role models made up of individuals, ERGs, organizations, and LGBTQ+ inclusion initiatives advancing representation and equity in measurable ways.\n\ufeff\nOutie Award Winners will be announced throughout the 2024 Out & Equal Workplace Summit from October 8-10.\u00a0\u00a0\nMeet Our Finalists\n \n\u200a\n\u200a\nCelebrating the Diversity of the LGBTQ+ Community\u00a0\n\u00a0\nAt Out & Equal, we\u2019re proud to acknowledge and celebrate the following:\u00a0\nBi+ Visibility Week (September 16-September 23) and Bi+ Visibility Day (September 23)\nAccording to \nresearch from Gallup\n, 58 percent of the LGBTQ+ community identifies as bisexual. Despite these numbers, additional data from \nPew Research\n notes that those who identify as bisexual are far less likely to come out to family and friends than their gay and lesbian counterparts.\u00a0\u00a0\nThese numbers highlight the significant challenges in achieving acceptance and understanding for members of the bi+ community. Out & Equal\u2019s \nAbout that B: Bi+ Inclusion at Work\n \nreport co-authored by bi+ expert and education, Robyn Ochs (she/her), helps fill in the gaps in information around bi+ identities in the workplace and provides tangible action items for employers and individuals.\u00a0\nRead the Report\n \n \nLatine Heritage Month begins on Sunday, September 15\n\ufeff\nThe LGBTQ+ community is not a monolith. It is a tapestry of diverse and intersecting identities. And even within those like identities, there is immense diversity across thought, perspectives, lived experiences, and background.\u00a0\u00a0\nIn a thought-provoking and insightful piece, Gabriel de la Cruz Soler (he/him), Senior Manager, Global Impact Programs (LATAM) at Out & Equal, highlights the evolution of identity within the Latin community where he notes,\n \u201cHispanic, Latinx, Latine, Latino, or Chicano? When it comes to labeling ourselves, there is no one correct answer. It depends on when you immigrated to the US, where you studied, where you were born, where you grew up, what your gender is, what generation you\u2019re from, and what community you would like to be a part of.\u201d\u00a0\u00a0\nRead Gabi's Blog\n \n\u200a\n\u200a\nWelcome to Our New Partners!\u00a0\nAt Out & Equal, we work with the world's leading and most influential companies\u2014and the\u00a0inclusive leaders in these organizations\u2014to advance LGBTQ+ representation, equity, inclusion, and belonging in the workplace.\u00a0\nWe\u2019re proud to welcome\n Abt Global, Cedars-Sinai, DPR Construction, Draper, Medline Industries, LP, Pernod Ricard, Trane Technologies, Turner Construction Company, and Weber Shandwick \nas our newest members of the Out & Equal Partner Community.\n \n\u200a\n\u200a\nJoin the Out & Equal Community\n\u200a\nThrough thought leadership and partnership (advisory services, knowledge, resources, and tools) and global programs and transformative events, becoming an Out & Equal Partner will supercharge your LGBTQ+ workplace inclusion progress. \nWe look forward to having you join us in the movement! \nPartner in the Business of Belonging\u2122\nLearn More\n \n\u200a\nFOLLOW US\n \u00a0\n \u00a0\n \u00a0\n \u00a0\n \n\u200a\noutandequal.org\nOut & Equal | \n1111 Broadway\n 3rd Floor | \nOakland, CA 94607 US\nUnsubscribe\n | \nUpdate Profile\n | \nConstant Contact Data Notice",

    "body": "Out & Equal\u2019s August 2024 Newsletter\n \n\u200a\n\u200a\nLearning From One Another\nLike many of us, these past several weeks I\u2019ve found myself preoccupied with the headlines. All that\u2019s going on in our country\u2014and around the world\u2014can activate a series of emotions spanning from worry and uncertainty to hope and optimism. Through it all, I\u2019ve been reminding myself that now is not a moment to turn inward; it\u2019s a moment to connect and learn from one another.\u00a0\u00a0\n\u00a0\u00a0\nAs we look across the table at family, friends, and colleagues, we must do so with open minds and hearts, a renewed willingness to listen and understand, and a brave insistence for the same in return.\u00a0\u00a0\n\u00a0\nWe must all explore our intellectual curiosity because, i\nn our current climate, there is an interest in pursuing clicks and views over truth and fact. Social media echo chambers only amplify viewpoints and perspectives we agree with and reinforce political and social divides.\u00a0\u00a0\nWhen we take the time to gain new knowledge, we are exposed to new perspectives and lived experiences that help us build understanding and empathy.\u00a0\u00a0\n\u00a0\nPerhaps most important of all, we are reminded of our shared humanity and that each individual deserves to be treated with dignity and respect. We are able to reflect on how we can be better allies to one another and address the inequities that exist in and out of the workplace.\u00a0\u00a0\n\u00a0\nAnd in a moment when some are trying to portray our community as outside of what's normal or worse, harmful to a society we have been part of and built, civility and understanding must illuminate the way forward.\u00a0\u00a0\n\u00a0\nBy navigating the discomfort that new knowledge and deeper relationships with our colleagues often offer, we can build more just and inclusive workplaces\u2014and communities\u2014that lead with belonging for all.\u00a0\n \n \n\u200a\n\u200a\nBuild Your Knowledge of Inclusion and Belonging\u00a0\n\u00a0\nAt Out & Equal, we have numerous resources designed to help you and your organizations meet the needs of LGBTQ+ talent and foster an inclusive and welcoming workplace.\u00a0\n\ufeffThey include:\u00a0\nGlobal Toolkit for Change: Assessing LGBTQI+ Inclusion in Your Workplace\n.\n\u00a0Around the world, we have seen instances of the business community leading the momentum for LGBTQ+ inclusion, often well ahead of legal and societal changes.

    "body": "Out & Equal\u2019s July 2024 Newsletter\n \n\u200a\n\u200a\nDoubling Down on Pride\nComing out of Pride Month, July can feel a bit anticlimactic. The parades are over, and the celebrations have come to a close.\n\u00a0\nBut that doesn\u2019t mean we\u2019re packing up and going home. \nIf anything, now is the moment to double down on Pride.\n\u00a0\nThis energy and momentum is powerful, and we cannot let it dissipate. Just because we\u2019ve flipped the calendar from June to July doesn\u2019t mean Pride and the principles behind it fade away.\n\u00a0\nAs our community continues to face anti-LGBTQ+ legislation, rhetoric that seeks to demean, and actions that aim to erase, we must use our voice. We must remind the world that we are here. And as we have done so many times before, we must\n stand strong, persevere, and push forward. \nThe moment demands it.\n\u00a0\nRight now, I\u2019m feeling energized, inspired, and ready to take on the world. For me, that comes from the celebrations of Queer joy, the moments centered in community, and the reminder that we are a radiant, unstoppable force.\n\u00a0\nWith our allies and entire community, we must and we will continue the fight for LGBTQ+ equity, inclusion, and belonging, in the workplace and beyond.\n \n \n\u200a\n\u200a\nA Message to CEOs\nDuring Pride Month, our CEO, Erin Uritus, penned a powerful piece in Fast Company. It contains a simple but important message to CEOs, applicable in Pride and beyond, \"do something you can really, truly be proud of.\"\nValuing difference and leading with inclusion and belonging are the right things to do. They are smart business practice. They represent the future, and the future is here and now.\n\u200a\nRead More\n \n\u200a\n \nRadiating Pride with the Out & Equal Team\n \n\ufeff\nTo celebrate the meaning, power, and impact of Pride, Out & Equal hosted a series of \nRadiate Pride Receptions.\n\u00a0\nAcross the United States\u2014Atlanta, San Francisco, Seattle, Los Angeles, and New York\u2014hundreds joined the Out & Equal leadership team for celebrations that served as a:\nReminder that our community is an unstoppable, radiant force.\nSpace to build community and connections with other organizations working to advance LGBTQ+ equity, inclusion, and belonging in the workplace, and beyond.\nMoment to spotlight and highlight Queer joy.\n \n \nCheck Out Our Recap Reel\n \n\ufeff\nIn addition to these powerful convenings centered on community, Erin Uritus, our CEO, participated in impactful discussions on the value of \u201cThe Business of Belonging,\u201d why authentic allyship matters, and how, as a collective community, we approach the future.\nAs we focus on Radiating Pride beyond June, be sure to \nrevisit her LinkedIn Live conversation\n with Sander van 't Noordende (he/him), CEO of Randstad, and Allyn Shaw (he/him), Out & Equal Board Chair and EVP, COO, Consumer Technology, Wells Fargo on:\n\u00a0\ncreating equitable workplaces where LGBTQ+ talent can belong and thrive,\nthe business case for inclusion and belonging, and\nhow organizations can drive positive change and show allyship year-round.\nWe are also grateful to the generosity of organizations like T-Mobile, which donated $200,000 to Out & Equal and Rise Brands, which raised more than $15,000 on our behalf. Through their support, we will continue to make meaningful impact and advance our mission of advancing LGBTQ+ workplace equity, inclusion, and belonging. \n\u200a\n\u200a\nCelebrating the Dynamism of the LGBTQ+ Community\nAs we recognize and celebrate Pride all year, we must highlight the diversity and intersectionality of the community, and the strength it brings to it.\nThroughout the month of July, Out & Equal is proud to recognize and celebrate:\nALL MONTH: Disability Pride Month\nJULY 6: Omnisexual & Omniromantic Pride & Visibility Day\nJULY 14: International Nonbinary People\u2019s Day\nJULY 16: International Drag Day\n\u00a0\nOur movement can only succeed when everyone is brought along. It\u2019s why at Out & Equal, we\u2019re committed to advancing the community and achieving our mission by understanding the experiences of all of the communities that make up our movement.\n\u00a0\nFor a deeper examination of intersectionality and inclusion, please view the resources featured within our \nFebruary newsletter\n.\n\u200a\n \nLast month, to further highlight the value of LGBTQ+ inclusion and belonging in the workplace, \nOut & Equal announced a partnership with Wind\u014d\n, the innovative platform for accessing, reviewing and comparing organizations\u2019 sustainability data (environmental impact, DEI and employee well-being).\n\u00a0\nIn our \u201cIn Conversation With\u201d series we speak to Ken Janssens (he/him), Wind\u014d\u2019s Co-founder and Head of Social Impact. In this discussion, Ken highlights his career journey, the value of DEIB, and how companies with a clear purpose that go beyond profit margins are more attractive to talent, especially Gen Z.\n \nRead More\n \n\u200a\n \nDriving Impact Across the Globe: \nReflections from Out & Equal\u2019s \n\ufeff\nSouthern States Forum\nDid you know that the American South is more racially diverse, more religious, and makes up more LGBTQ+-headed households than any other part of the country?\n\u00a0\nIt's why convenings like our Southern States Forum, which we hosted in Atlanta last month, are incredibly important.\n\u00a0\nThrough a powerful program centered on intersectionality, inclusion-building strategies, and action-oriented solutions to drive meaningful change, we brought together leaders, practitioners, and changemakers for inspiring keynotes, dynamic discussions, and insightful learning sessions \u2014all aimed at exploring the unique challenges and opportunities businesses face in creating truly inclusive workplaces for LGBTQ+ employees and allies.\n\u00a0\nAttendees from across the region and various industries had the opportunity to build long-lasting connections and gained the tools needed to become changemakers in their organizations and communities.\n\u00a0\nRead the Retrospective\n \n\u200a\n \nPresented by Bank of America and Supported by Dell\nConvening Next Week!\n\u200a\n\u200a\n \nSAVE THE DATE!\nThis year\u2019s Out & Equal \nWorkplace Summit\n is back in Orlando from October 8-10 with our pre-Summit Leadership Lab Day on October 7!\nThe largest LGBTQ+ workplace inclusion event in the world,\n Summit promises to amplify much-needed inspirational stories, meaningful discussions, and thought-provoking sessions that will equip attendees with the tools and connections to make a difference in their organizations.\nWorkplace Summit Registration, which is Exclusive to Out & Equal Partners, is \nNow Open\n!\n\u200a\nOutie Awards Deadline Extended to Sunday, July 14!\nWe're extending the deadline to submit a nomination for the Outie Awards to \nSunday, July 14 at 11:59 p.m. EST.\n\u00a0\nDon't miss your opportunity to elevate an LGBTQ+ inclusion champion and/or position your organization as an employer of choice that leads with inclusion and belonging.

But the partnership didn\u2019t stop there. SAP leaders knew they would also need to train their global workforce on technical topics related to the product change. In 2018, SAP\u2019s workforce completed fewer than 3,000 courses.\u00a0\n \nJust four years later, in 2022, they saw almost 28,000 course completions, and collectively, SAP employees learned for more than 75,000 hours on Pluralsight in 2023. The continued enthusiasm for Pluralsight\u2019s content subsequently led SAP to open access to its entire development department, with plans to further expand this year.\nDOWNLOAD NOW\n \nSPONSORED BY:\n \nBetterWork Media Group,\u00a01 E.

But the partnership didn\u2019t stop there. SAP leaders knew they would also need to train their global workforce on technical topics related to the product change. In 2018, SAP\u2019s workforce completed fewer than 3,000 courses.\u00a0\n \nJust four years later, in 2022, they saw almost 28,000 course completions, and collectively, SAP employees learned for more than 75,000 hours on Pluralsight in 2023. The continued enthusiasm for Pluralsight\u2019s content subsequently led SAP to open access to its entire development department, with plans to further expand this year.\nDOWNLOAD NOW\n \nSPONSORED BY:\n \nBetterWork Media Group,\u00a01 E.

    "body": "You don't often get email from hello@outandequal.org. \nLearn why this is important\nOut & Equal\u2019s April 2024 Newsletter\n \n\u200a\n\u200a\nThe Power of Community and Convening: Illuminating the Path Forward and Driv\ufeffing Meaningful Change\nIt was just a week ago that we kicked off the\n \n2024 Out & Equal Leadership Forum\n, a convening focused on and dedicated to inclusive leadership and amplifying the change agent within each of us. As I interacted with the hundreds of attendees and took in as much content as possible, I couldn\u2019t help but be inspired \nand\n introspective.\nLeadership Forum was filled with rich discussions, insightful learning sessions on topics of LGBTQ+ workplace inclusion, and plenty of opportunity to connect and build relationships with attendees from our Partner community. Beyond that, our focus on bolstering individuals\u2019 capabilities to become better changes agents means that we have truly unleashed a new cohort of professionals who will return to their workplaces better equipped to do this important work at a time it\u2019s needed most.\nI have been filled with pride at what the team re-imagined for this event (previously known as the Executive Forum) and am reminded of the importance of community and the power it holds\u2014especially in times of uncertainty and when illumination and clarity is required to cut effectively through the disinformation and noise. While there were many moments that stayed with me, I want to share a few highlights.\nNumber One\n. In one of our mainstage discussions, we released findings from a new Out & Equal report titled,\n \nTalent on the Move-Where Do We Go From Here?\n \nThis research, which was made possible by funding from the Wells Fargo Foundation, examines how the changing US legislative landscape and the surge in anti-LGBTQ+ bills are impacting the LGBTQ+ workforce experience and the actionable steps employers can take to effectively respond.\nHere are a few of the topline findings:\n \nThe report\u2019s findings kicked off critical discussions about the current moment we find ourselves in, why the LGBTQ+ community needs action paired with authentic allyship, and how businesses and their leaders have been and must become changemakers driving greater LGBTQ+ inclusion in the workplace.\nNumber Two\n. At Out & Equal, we know that the LGBTQ+ community is not a monolith. It\u2019s intersectional and comprised of groups and individuals with varying experiences and needs. And unless all are recognized and prioritized in workplace inclusion and belonging efforts, our movement toward greater and lasting workplace equity cannot and will not succeed.\nAs part of our work, we are aiming to support employers in leveraging the \nfull\n talents of the LGBTQ+ workforce particularly, transgender and nonbinary leaders. It\u2019s why heading into Leadership Forum, we also released \nWhere the Margins Meet the Corner Office: Five Leadership Insights from Transgender and Nonbinary Leaders\n.\nThe key takeaway: When transgender and nonbinary leaders are genuinely supported and encouraged to bring the fullness of their expertise, identities, and life experiences to their executive roles, they unlock a wealth of opportunities and advantages for their organizations.\nThroughout Leadership Forum, the insights highlighted in this body of work drove meaningful discussions and conversations about the future of work, the value of difference and diversity, and the importance of creating workplace cultures rich in inclusion and belonging so all individuals can bring their authentic selves to work, contribute to their fullest potential, and thrive.\n\ufeffNumber Three. \nOur \u201cLight Up the Night\u201d themed Momentum closing reception reminded me that even in the most challenging of times, our movement is filled with light, joy, and strength. As individuals and as a community, we can never forget our resilience or the power we possess. Nor can we lose touch with our ability to create a brighter future for ourselves and the world.\nBy convening and building community, we can share learnings, have the difficult conversations, and discuss how we can continue to advance and expand the movement to ensure we\u2019re widening the path behind us with each interaction, and so much more. We can be reminded of our power and how we are an unstoppable, growing, and radiant force.\nAnd while Leadership Forum has concluded, I am filled with energy and looking forward to the convenings that lie ahead from our Global Impact Forums this spring, to summer Pride celebrations, and the 2024 Workplace Summit in the fall.\nI\u2019ll see you there!\n \n \n\u200a\n\u200a\n \n\u200a\nWe are in a moment when the voices and actions of a few are attempting to dim the light and progress of an entire movement. And while it may seem overwhelming, we must remember our potential, our strength, and our value. In times of adversity, doubt, and challenge, Queer joy and resilience will always outshine and persevere.\nEach one of us possesses this light inside of us that when nurtured and joined by others is magnified. It becomes a beacon of hope, connection, truth, and safety. Every day in our workplaces, LGBTQ+ people\u2013and their allies\u2013work relentlessly to illuminate paths toward inclusion and belonging.\nAnd through the Out & Equal Workplace Summit, we will harness, nurture, and grow that light. We will remind our collective community and the world of the brilliance and power we\u2014the LGBTQ+ community and our allies\u2014hold. We will remind them that we are an unstoppable, radiant force.\nWorkplace Summit\n, \nth\ne largest LGBTQ+ workplace inclusion event in the world, is an Out & Equal Partner exclusive e\nvent.

    "body": "You don't often get email from hello@outandequal.org. \nLearn why this is important\nOut & Equal\u2019s March 2024 Newsletter\n \n\u200a\n\u200a\nFirsts Are Essential. Seconds Are Critical. Movements Must Be Intentional.\nLeadership. Personally, and as the CEO of \nOut & Equal\n, \nan organization dedicated to advancing LGBTQ+ workplace equity and inclusion, I am always thinking about what leadership means, how it\u2019s identified, how it\u2019s nurtured, and about who gets chosen (or overlooked) to be elevated to that status or level\n.\nAnd now, with Women\u2019s History Month underway, International Women\u2019s Day approaching (March 8th), and \nOut & Equal\u2019s 2024 Leadership Forum\n just a few weeks away (March 25-27) all set against a backdrop of continued anti-LGBTQ+ efforts and legislation\u2014\nleadership is a topic that has taken on added heft and implications\n. \nLet\u2019s look at some statistics:\nAn \narticle from Axios\n referencing an analysis from Bloomberg poignantly states, \u201cWomen only hold 8.2% of CEO roles at large companies.\u201d\n \nData from \nWomen in the Workplace\n, a comprehensive research report conducted by McKinsey and Lean In, finds that, \u201cWomen represent roughly one in four C-suite leaders, and women of color just one in 16.\u201d\n \nAnd when we aim to examine LGBTQ+ women in leadership roles, the data is even harder to come by. But what is available does highlight some of the challenges LGBTQ+ women face more broadly in the workplace.\u00a0\nAgain, citing \nWomen in the Workplace\n and their analysis of intersectional experiences:\n \n1 in 5 LGBTQ+ women have been mistaken for someone more junior.\n1 in 3 LGBTQ+ women say others get credit for their ideas.\n2 in 5 LGBTQ+ women say their judgement is questioned.\n1 in 3 LGBTQ+ women say a senior coworker has advocated on their behalf for a raise.\nThe facts above are a stark reminder that all women have an uphill climb to achieving equity in the workplace. These challenges and barriers are even more acute for women who are in marginalized and overlooked communities such as Queer women, transgender women, and women of color\n.\nLooking at the transgender community as an example, more than seven in ten (71%) transgender respondents in the\n \nExperiences of the Lavender Ceiling\n, \na report Out & Equal developed in partnership with Korn Ferry to spotlight the progress challenges facing out LGBTQ+ leaders at work, reported gender identity and expression as the primary source of bias they\u2019ve experienced in the workplace, compared to 15% of cisgender respondents. And when looking at LGBTQ+ representation more broadly, that same report noted that nearly half (49%) of survey respondents don\u2019t view their company\u2019s C-suite as representative of the LGBTQ+ community at all.\nI am a bisexual, pansexual, and Queer woman. I am a CEO who has navigated the challenges experienced by women and Queer people in the workplace. I am a first for Out & Equal\n.\nAnd as I commence my seventh year as CEO of this organization, I am reflecting on my own journey to this role and recognizing the importance and responsibility of advancing movement-making impact by realizing not only firsts, but ensuring seconds, thirds, and beyond are more than achievable, but the norm\n.\nLet\u2019s examine this further.\nFirsts are essential. \nYou have to get through the door and secure a seat at the table. Once you do, how you leverage that experience and earned influence to create sustainable change and build a wider pathway of inclusion and belonging really matters. Firsts can easily be viewed as a checked box and lauded as a victory and assumption that the work of equity, inclusion, and belonging are finished. That could not be further from the truth. When a first is achieved, the work must be accelerated\n.\n \nSeconds are critical. \nJust because a first is achieved, does not mean a second is guaranteed. Leaders and organizations must be intentional to ensure a continued commitment to and investment in pathways of leadership advancement for all\u2014pathways inclusive of historically marginalized and overlooked communities\n.\n \nMovements must be intentional. \nFirst and seconds are foundational to create movement-making impact. How so? They begin to change hearts and minds, set new expectations, and establish a new normality. It\u2019s a reverberating effect that allows individuals to see what is possible for themselves and for others, elevates and empowers new voices, creates opportunities for those who have been overlooked for too long, and unlocks innovation for workplaces and the societies they serve. And as these firsts and seconds grow into a movement, we must always remember to be intentional in our thought process, approach, and decision making. Is our movement inclusive? Are we building a wider pathway that brings everyone along? Are we approaching solutions with an intersectional lens? How are allies and individuals in positions of power leveraging their spheres of influence to elevate and empower historically marginalized and overlooked communities? These are all critical elements to building a movement that is inclusive, intentional, and impactful in meaningful ways.\n \nSo, as we look towards the future and creating cultures rich in inclusion and belonging, let\u2019s acknowledge the challenges all women particularly Queer women, transgender women, and women of color have and continue to face. Let\u2019s be sure we\u2019re investing in their future and growth. Let\u2019s make sure we\u2019re laying the groundwork not for just firsts, but seconds, thirds, and beyond!\n \n \n\u200a\n\u200a\nRecognizing, Honoring, and Celebrating Transgender Day of \nVisibility\n \nNow, more than ever before, visibility and recognition matter.\nAs transgender and nonbinary people face erasure, discrimination, and systemic attacks, allies and the broader LGBTQ+ community and movement have an obligation to stand up for and\nalongside them authentically and intentionally, ensuring they are seen, heard, and protected,\nwhile elevating their remarkable stories, which have shaped the world we live in.\n \nFrom the everyday heroes to the trailblazers and icons, transgender and nonbinary people have pushed the cause of equality forward for all people and created a world that is rich in culture, art, and love.\nOn Transgender Day of Visibility and beyond, we encourage you to:\nSpeak up on behalf of transgender and nonbinary people and don\u2019t let their stories be pushed aside, erased, coopted, and/or forgotten.
