    "body": "Hello, Almendra, \u00a0\nHow are you today? I know you\u2019ve worked with others at LCW and I\u2019ve heard great things about you!\nI wanted to see if by chance you might be up to facilitating a \u201cLeading Inclusively\u201d workshop for one of our clients (a global medical devices company) for an EMEA (mostly European) audience on March 10\nth\n from 11am to 2pm CET (with a 10 min break). We have already designed the content and facilitator notes.\nHere\u2019s the bad news - our budget is quite small at this time due to current strains to our industry, as I\u2019m sure you\u2019re well aware\u2026. So we can\u2019t pay our usual rates at this time. We cannot afford to pay more than $300 per hour of facilitation, so the total would be $300*3 = $900, including prep.\n\u00a0\nWhat do you think? \nWarmly,\nRebecca\n\u00a0\nRebecca M. Parrilla\n \n(MBA, Latina, LGBTQ, Mom)\n(she/her) \nWhy pronouns matter\nHead of Client Solutions\nWe help develop the mindsets and systems needed to foster resilient, diverse, and equitable teams that will be successful in a cross-cultural world.\nWebsite\n\u00a0\n|\n\u00a0\nFacebook\n\u00a0\n|\n\u00a0\nLinkedIn\n\u00a0\nI live and work in Chapel Hill, NC \u2013 on the traditional homelands of the Occaneechi, Shakori, Eno, and Sissipahaw peoples.",

    "body": "Hello Almendra,\n\u00a0\nIt was so lovely to facilitate with you the other month! I was hoping to have an opportunity to work together again, and a new client need has come up. I am reaching out to see if you are both available and interested in supporting a few deliveries of our Understanding Microaggressions training. The courses will be delivered in English, but our client (the Inter-American Development Bank) is eager for a facilitator that can receive and answer questions in Spanish. I also think it will make the training even more effective.\n\u00a0\nAre you interested? And if you are, might you be available for an initial training on June 20 from 3-4:30 PM EST? \n\u00a0\nI\u2019d love to set up a quick time to chat through the project if you\u2019re interested and able (even if you can\u2019t make that specific time work) \u2013 let me know what you think!\n\u00a0\nThanks,\nGrace\n\u00a0\n------------------------------------------------------\nGrace Vottero\n(she/her/hers)\nConsultant,\n LCW\nEmail: \ng.vottero@lcwmail.com\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\nwww\n\u00a0\n|\n\u00a0\nTwitter\n \n|\n\u00a0\nFacebook\n\u00a0\n|\n\u00a0\nLinkedIn\n\u00a0\nTo inspire kindness, deepen\u00a0understanding, and\nfoster equity in\u00a0the communities\u00a0where people\nlive\u00a0and at the organizations where they\u00a0work.",

It runs similarly to Conscious Inclusion so I think it shouldn\u2019t be too unfamiliar.\n\u00a0\nI\u2019m writing today because we have a client who has a new CEO coming in from Italy to the US; and while he has worked globally, this will be his first time living and working in the US and leading a US team that has a strong DEI commitment. The goal is to have a 4-hour session with an IDI to be delivered before February 27\nth\n.\n\u00a0\nIf you are interested, could you please send me availability that we could offer the client where you can dedicate 4 hours. We could compensate you at a rate of $2,000.\n\u00a0\nPlease let me know if this is something you\u2019d like to take on and your availability.\n\u00a0\nTamara\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n-\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nTamara Thorpe (she/her)\nPrincipal Consultant, LCW\nEmail: t.thorpe@lcwmail.com\nPhone: +1-773-888-4942\n \n\u00a0\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\nwww\n\u00a0\n|\n\u00a0\nTwitter\n \n|\n\u00a0\nFacebook\n\u00a0\n|\n\u00a0\nLinkedIn\n\u00a0\n \n\u00a0\nTo inspire kindness, deepen\u00a0understanding, and\nfoster equity in\u00a0the communities\u00a0where people\nlive\u00a0and at the organizations where they\u00a0work.",

I'm cc'ing in Rapha\u00eblle, and am also sharing with Jeffrey, so that he can have the information too.\nRapha\u00eblle and I met briefly before the start, and she gave me some information regarding the mood of the group. She mentioned that this has been a fairly hectic time for them, especially in HR as there has been a lot of pressure on their side. We decided to ask permission to record the session so she could view it later as she wasn't going to be able to attend.\u00a0 We also agreed that I would share that I knew that things were hectic because Rapha\u00eblle and I had spoken. \nThere were 4 participants for the first 1/2 hour and then we were joined by a 5th. They agreed that it was OK to record. They also indicated that they hadn't started lesson 3 yet as they've had it for 2 days. The general mood was collaborative, open and reflective.\nEarlier this morning I shared the recording with Rapha\u00eblle.\nMy key take-aways from the meta conversation on the learning program were:\na greater need for constraint in terms of timing and an increase in remainders. Because of the stress of the HR job, to ensure better support for the autonomous work so that it gets done\nlesson 1 had a much larger scope of work than lesson 2, also some readings were very long. The level of challenge on lesson one was greater too than lesson 2\nthe pair work was very valuable, when followed. Sarah Hinchcliffe-Smith mentioned that she doesn't have a partner and is looking forward to getting one\nthe content and reflection were very eye-opening, they appreciate the challenge of the work\nenjoyment over the IDI debriefs and learning about own levels of competency and areas for growth and development\ntestimonials are very helpful and bring to life the experiences of the cultures represented\nI actually started with a discussion on lesson 2 first and then we went to lesson 1 as lesson 2 was more present for them. \nIn addition to this, during the discussion, Antonine Bocage-Marchand indicated that he doesn't see the DEI strategy, perhaps it is being discussed higher up with regards to policies regarding disabilities and race/ethnicity, however the only place he recognizes it being addressed is in relation to ERGs. \nIt seemed as if others were more aware of the strategy; a little hard to tell though. My recommendation is to check in with HR managers to make sure that they are aware of the strategy, provided that there have been decisions made that will help them to better carry out their roles. \nIf any of you have questions about this or would like further details, do please let me know.\nAll the best, and I hope today's afternoon check in goes well!\n-Almendra",
