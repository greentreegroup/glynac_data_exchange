    "body": "Hello, Almendra, \u00a0\nHow are you today? I know you\u2019ve worked with others at LCW and I\u2019ve heard great things about you!\nI wanted to see if by chance you might be up to facilitating a \u201cLeading Inclusively\u201d workshop for one of our clients (a global medical devices company) for an EMEA (mostly European) audience on March 10\nth\n from 11am to 2pm CET (with a 10 min break). We have already designed the content and facilitator notes.\nHere\u2019s the bad news - our budget is quite small at this time due to current strains to our industry, as I\u2019m sure you\u2019re well aware\u2026. So we can\u2019t pay our usual rates at this time. We cannot afford to pay more than $300 per hour of facilitation, so the total would be $300*3 = $900, including prep.\n\u00a0\nWhat do you think? \nWarmly,\nRebecca\n\u00a0\nRebecca M. Parrilla\n \n(MBA, Latina, LGBTQ, Mom)\n(she/her) \nWhy pronouns matter\nHead of Client Solutions\nWe help develop the mindsets and systems needed to foster resilient, diverse, and equitable teams that will be successful in a cross-cultural world.\nWebsite\n\u00a0\n|\n\u00a0\nFacebook\n\u00a0\n|\n\u00a0\nLinkedIn\n\u00a0\nI live and work in Chapel Hill, NC \u2013 on the traditional homelands of the Occaneechi, Shakori, Eno, and Sissipahaw peoples.",

    "body": "Hello Almendra,\n\u00a0\nIt was so lovely to facilitate with you the other month! I was hoping to have an opportunity to work together again, and a new client need has come up. I am reaching out to see if you are both available and interested in supporting a few deliveries of our Understanding Microaggressions training. The courses will be delivered in English, but our client (the Inter-American Development Bank) is eager for a facilitator that can receive and answer questions in Spanish. I also think it will make the training even more effective.\n\u00a0\nAre you interested? And if you are, might you be available for an initial training on June 20 from 3-4:30 PM EST? \n\u00a0\nI\u2019d love to set up a quick time to chat through the project if you\u2019re interested and able (even if you can\u2019t make that specific time work) \u2013 let me know what you think!\n\u00a0\nThanks,\nGrace\n\u00a0\n------------------------------------------------------\nGrace Vottero\n(she/her/hers)\nConsultant,\n LCW\nEmail: \ng.vottero@lcwmail.com\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\nwww\n\u00a0\n|\n\u00a0\nTwitter\n \n|\n\u00a0\nFacebook\n\u00a0\n|\n\u00a0\nLinkedIn\n\u00a0\nTo inspire kindness, deepen\u00a0understanding, and\nfoster equity in\u00a0the communities\u00a0where people\nlive\u00a0and at the organizations where they\u00a0work.",

It runs similarly to Conscious Inclusion so I think it shouldn\u2019t be too unfamiliar.\n\u00a0\nI\u2019m writing today because we have a client who has a new CEO coming in from Italy to the US; and while he has worked globally, this will be his first time living and working in the US and leading a US team that has a strong DEI commitment. The goal is to have a 4-hour session with an IDI to be delivered before February 27\nth\n.\n\u00a0\nIf you are interested, could you please send me availability that we could offer the client where you can dedicate 4 hours. We could compensate you at a rate of $2,000.\n\u00a0\nPlease let me know if this is something you\u2019d like to take on and your availability.\n\u00a0\nTamara\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n-\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nTamara Thorpe (she/her)\nPrincipal Consultant, LCW\nEmail: t.thorpe@lcwmail.com\nPhone: +1-773-888-4942\n \n\u00a0\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\nwww\n\u00a0\n|\n\u00a0\nTwitter\n \n|\n\u00a0\nFacebook\n\u00a0\n|\n\u00a0\nLinkedIn\n\u00a0\n \n\u00a0\nTo inspire kindness, deepen\u00a0understanding, and\nfoster equity in\u00a0the communities\u00a0where people\nlive\u00a0and at the organizations where they\u00a0work.",

We decided to ask permission to record the session so she could view it later as she wasn't going to be able to attend.\u00a0 We also agreed that I would share that I knew that things were hectic because Rapha\u00eblle and I had spoken. \nThere were 4 participants for the first 1/2 hour and then we were joined by a 5th. They agreed that it was OK to record. They also indicated that they hadn't started lesson 3 yet as they've had it for 2 days. The general mood was collaborative, open and reflective.\nEarlier this morning I shared the recording with Rapha\u00eblle.\nMy key take-aways from the meta conversation on the learning program were:\na greater need for constraint in terms of timing and an increase in remainders. Because of the stress of the HR job, to ensure better support for the autonomous work so that it gets done\nlesson 1 had a much larger scope of work than lesson 2, also some readings were very long. The level of challenge on lesson one was greater too than lesson 2\nthe pair work was very valuable, when followed. Sarah Hinchcliffe-Smith mentioned that she doesn't have a partner and is looking forward to getting one\nthe content and reflection were very eye-opening, they appreciate the challenge of the work\nenjoyment over the IDI debriefs and learning about own levels of competency and areas for growth and development\ntestimonials are very helpful and bring to life the experiences of the cultures represented\nI actually started with a discussion on lesson 2 first and then we went to lesson 1 as lesson 2 was more present for them. \nIn addition to this, during the discussion, Antonine Bocage-Marchand indicated that he doesn't see the DEI strategy, perhaps it is being discussed higher up with regards to policies regarding disabilities and race/ethnicity, however the only place he recognizes it being addressed is in relation to ERGs. \nIt seemed as if others were more aware of the strategy; a little hard to tell though. My recommendation is to check in with HR managers to make sure that they are aware of the strategy, provided that there have been decisions made that will help them to better carry out their roles. \nIf any of you have questions about this or would like further details, do please let me know.\nAll the best, and I hope today's afternoon check in goes well!\n-Almendra",

    "body": "Hello wonderful IDI Partners,\n\u00a0\nI am writing to ask for your help in delivering individual IDI debriefs to senior leaders at Prudential as part of an ongoing multifaceted DEI program. You would be involved in one facet of the program \u2013 individual IDI coaching sessions for leaders.\n\u00a0\nThe program we need your help with is called Building Cultural Intelligence \u2013 it\u2019s basically a Prudential-specific version of our Building a Culture of Inclusion, which you may be familiar with. We are delivering the program systematically to intact leadership teams across the organization \u2013 teams that lead business lines, functions, or geographies. The session includes an IDI group debrief, so leaders are taking the IDI as prework. Afterwards (and where we hope you will come in), each participant will receive a 30-minute Individual Debrief session. Everyone at Prudential (sponsors and participants) are really excited to be going through this journey with us, as we have expanded on the offerings we did last year, and they have all heard wonderful things.\n\u00a0\nTHE ASK: We have another 18 Groups who will be going through this process with us this Calendar year. Each group could be as large as 50 people, so we would love to have you as our primary IDI Facilitators for this journey. If you are interested in this, we ask that you commit to performing at least \n100 of these 30-minute IDI Debriefs by the end of the year, depending on scheduling, to which you would receive $60/30-minute debrief.\n\u00a0 PLEASE NOTE: We realize this price may be below what we are paying you for other engagements, and are hoping that the potential for high volume will help offset that \u2013 unfortunately this client negotiated with strongarm tactics and is paying us very little \u2013 we are just trying to break even and give them a good experience. \n\u00a0\nThe first group that we will need to be scheduling for goes through their Group Debrief on September 8, and have group debriefs almost every week (sometimes twice a week) until the last one on December 8. Ideally, we will have at least a few available times every weekday for participants to choose from, based on your availability, starting on September 9\nth\n, and going through December 30\nth\n (obviously with some holidays and days off excluded).\n\u00a0\nIf this is something you are interested in working with us on, please, let me know and I will send over the required documentation as well as begin working with you to accumulate times.\n\u00a0\nPlease, let me know if you have any questions or concerns.\n\u00a0\nThank you,\n\u00a0\nConner Williams, CPCC\nConsultant\nLCW \n100 S Saunders Rd, Suite 150\nLake Forest, IL 60045 USA\nGender pronouns:\u00a0He/Him/His \u00a0 \n\u00a0\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\nwww\n\u00a0\n|\n\u00a0\nTwitter\n \n|\n\u00a0\nFacebook\n\u00a0\n|\n\u00a0\nLinkedIn",

We\u2019ve partnered with a global DE&I consultancy called\n\u00a0\nLCW\n\u00a0\nto conduct a bias and inclusion audit of FleishmanHillard. As part of this, they are hosting a series of focus groups with several communities across the firm.

As part of the process, LCW is completing an in-depth analysis of organizational mindsets as well as people policies and systems at FleishmanHillard to assess our culture and identify potential biases.\u00a0\u00a0\n\u00a0\nWe understand that we completed the global DE&I and employee engagement surveys earlier in the year, both of which provide critical feedback about the employee experience at FleishmanHillard. With this process we\u2019re looking to better understand\n\u00a0\nhow\n\u00a0\nour people systems and processes can drive a more inclusive culture and address barriers to progress. The focus groups specifically will create a safe space for you to have an interactive dialogue with a third party, allowing us to gain\n\u00a0\ndifferent, deeper and more comprehensive\n\u00a0\ninsights that typically aren\u2019t possible with surveys. All of these initiatives are imperative as we look to drive meaningful impact for our firm and our people. \u202f\u00a0\n\u00a0\nDuring the focus group, LCW will lead a discussion around how our firm can better prioritize the topics and issues that are important to you. Your feedback will help inform a strategic roadmap outlining how FleishmanHillard can advance inclusion throughout the firm, including enhancements to future learning and development. Attached to the invite is a background document with some additional information about LCW and the audit, as well as a short Q&A. You will also find a bio for the LCW consultant who is facilitating the session.\u00a0\u00a0\n\u00a0\nOur employees are the most critical part of our culture. You were recommended for this focus group by your leadership, and we highly encourage you to participate in this important initiative. If you are unable to join, or have additional questions, please reach out to \n@Rachel Coleman (FleishmanHillard)\n soon as possible.\n\u00a0\nAchieving progress is part of everyone\u2019s job at FleishmanHillard, and we are excited to move forward on this next step of our journey.\u00a0\u00a0\n\u00a0\nAs always, thank you for your continued support with helping us become the most inclusive agency in the world.\nFor information about how we process personal data, please visit our privacy policy at https://fleishmanhillard.com/privacy-policy-general/ and our privacy policy applicable to the European Economic Area at https://fleishmanhillard.com/gdpr-privacy-policy/.",

I'm not sure if you'd like me to change the first so it looks more like the last, or if the Universal logo is ok on its own. Let me know and I can edit it again if necessary. \nYes, please make it similar to the last slide so that all logos are sized the same and next to each other. \nI've included the timeline slide at the end so that Paula can go over it in her closing of the workshop. \nGreat. \nI'd like to draw attention to the notes in slide 6. I've included mentioning Jean Pascal Zadi's initiative there. I can remove it if we don't get permission. I think it flows nicely, however if by the end of today I don't hear back, then I won't say it. \nWill defer to Paula, but I don\u2019t think we received permission.\nI'd like to draw attention to the notes in slide 22. Here is where in the debrief we can mention \"must-haves\" vs. \"nice-to-haves\". However, would you like me to bring it up before sending them out into the breakout rooms? As a facilitator I'd like to see them come up with their own ideas and not provide an initial suggestion in case this primes them to think in a particular way. If you are comfortable with that then in the debrief, if they haven't discussed this idea on their own, I can bring it up and we can expand upon it. Is that alright?\u00a0\nIn thinking about it, we want to move away from the term \u201cmust-haves\u201d and \u201cnice to haves\u201d with this group. Let\u2019s keep the conversation framed to be focused on being thoughtful and as representative and authentic as possible without giving specific mandates. And yes, I agree that we can see what ideas they come up with first. \nLast but not least, Vince will be opening up the Zoom room and I'll likely be connecting at about 10 minutes before the start time because I'll be getting back then from teaching my class at Stanford University in Madrid. Vince will also have the pdf of the important content slides ready so that we can share them. \nGreat, I\u2019ll plan to be in 15 minutes prior. Are we able to record the presentation for those who are unable to attend?\n\u00a0\nThank you! I\u2019ll go through this in detail this morning and send any additional notes. \n\u00a0\nBest,\n\u00a0\nJeff\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\nFrom:\n Almendra Staffa-Healey <\na.staffahealey@lcwmail.com\n> \nSent:\n Friday, May 27, 2022 2:51 AM\nTo:\n Cafuir, Jeff (NBCUniversal) <\nJeff.Cafuir@nbcuni.com\n>; Pratt, Paula (NBCUniversal) <\npaula.pratt@nbcuni.com\n>; Tamara Thorpe <\nt.thorpe@lcwmail.com\n>; Vince Bongiovanni <\nv.bongiovanni@lcwmail.com\n>\nCc:\n Thao, Blia (NBCUniversal) <\nBlia.Thao@nbcuni.com\n>; Halloran, Tara (NBCUniversal) <\nTara.Halloran@nbcuni.com\n>\nSubject:\n [EXTERNAL] UPI/LCW Workshop #1 Powerpoint\n\u00a0\nDear Jeff and Paula,\nI'm sending the powerpoint via WeTransfer as it weights too much to attach it to this message. \nI've added the logos to the front slide and end slides.

I'm not sure if you'd like me to change the first so it looks more like the last, or if the Universal logo is ok on its own. Let me know and I can edit it again if necessary. \nYes, please make it similar to the last slide so that all logos are sized the same and next to each other. \nI've included the timeline slide at the end so that Paula can go over it in her closing of the workshop. \nGreat. \nI'd like to draw attention to the notes in slide 6. I've included mentioning Jean Pascal Zadi's initiative there. I can remove it if we don't get permission. I think it flows nicely, however if by the end of today I don't hear back, then I won't say it. \nWill defer to Paula, but I don\u2019t think we received permission.\nI'd like to draw attention to the notes in slide 22. Here is where in the debrief we can mention \"must-haves\" vs. \"nice-to-haves\". However, would you like me to bring it up before sending them out into the breakout rooms? As a facilitator I'd like to see them come up with their own ideas and not provide an initial suggestion in case this primes them to think in a particular way. If you are comfortable with that then in the debrief, if they haven't discussed this idea on their own, I can bring it up and we can expand upon it. Is that alright?\u00a0\nIn thinking about it, we want to move away from the term \u201cmust-haves\u201d and \u201cnice to haves\u201d with this group. Let\u2019s keep the conversation framed to be focused on being thoughtful and as representative and authentic as possible without giving specific mandates. And yes, I agree that we can see what ideas they come up with first. \nLast but not least, Vince will be opening up the Zoom room and I'll likely be connecting at about 10 minutes before the start time because I'll be getting back then from teaching my class at Stanford University in Madrid. Vince will also have the pdf of the important content slides ready so that we can share them. \nGreat, I\u2019ll plan to be in 15 minutes prior. Are we able to record the presentation for those who are unable to attend?\n\u00a0\nThank you! I\u2019ll go through this in detail this morning and send any additional notes. \n\u00a0\nBest,\n\u00a0\nJeff\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\nFrom:\n Almendra Staffa-Healey <\na.staffahealey@lcwmail.com\n> \nSent:\n Friday, May 27, 2022 2:51 AM\nTo:\n Cafuir, Jeff (NBCUniversal) <\nJeff.Cafuir@nbcuni.com\n>; Pratt, Paula (NBCUniversal) <\npaula.pratt@nbcuni.com\n>; Tamara Thorpe <\nt.thorpe@lcwmail.com\n>; Vince Bongiovanni <\nv.bongiovanni@lcwmail.com\n>\nCc:\n Thao, Blia (NBCUniversal) <\nBlia.Thao@nbcuni.com\n>; Halloran, Tara (NBCUniversal) <\nTara.Halloran@nbcuni.com\n>\nSubject:\n [EXTERNAL] UPI/LCW Workshop #1 Powerpoint\n\u00a0\nDear Jeff and Paula,\nI'm sending the powerpoint via WeTransfer as it weights too much to attach it to this message. \nI've added the logos to the front slide and end slides.

We have a better sense of the audience and their readiness for the conversation and sticking points that we will use to build Part 2. We will definitely begin with the content we didn\u2019t cover yesterday on Authentic Inclusive Representation and build on the conversation that came up at the end on casting, reverse discrimination, and actions they can take to grow and diversity their talent pools.\n\u00a0\nOur Tech Team is working on the Zoom recording and link; and I\u2019ll put together the key slides in a PDF. If there were any specific slides you all noted that you want to be sure are included please let me know.\n\u00a0\nWe look forward to opportunities to work with the local teams, and the fall workshop/\n\u00a0\nI\u2019ll be in touch soon with the link and PDF.\n\u00a0\nAll the best,\nTamara\n\u00a0\nFrom:\n Cafuir, Jeff (NBCUniversal) <Jeff.Cafuir@nbcuni.com> \nSent:\n Wednesday, June 1, 2022 10:03 AM\nTo:\n Tamara Thorpe <t.thorpe@lcwmail.com>; Almendra Staffa-Healey <a.staffahealey@lcwmail.com>; Vince Bongiovanni <v.bongiovanni@lcwmail.com>\nCc:\n Thao, Blia (NBCUniversal) <Blia.Thao@nbcuni.com>; Halloran, Tara (NBCUniversal) <Tara.Halloran@nbcuni.com>; Pratt, Paula (NBCUniversal) <paula.pratt@nbcuni.com>\nSubject:\n RE: UPI/LCW Workshop #1 Powerpoint\n\u00a0\nHi LCW Team, \n\u00a0\nThank you for your support in planning and facilitating yesterday\u2019s workshop.

I'm not sure if you'd like me to change the first so it looks more like the last, or if the Universal logo is ok on its own. Let me know and I can edit it again if necessary. \nYes, please make it similar to the last slide so that all logos are sized the same and next to each other. \nI've included the timeline slide at the end so that Paula can go over it in her closing of the workshop. \nGreat. \nI'd like to draw attention to the notes in slide 6. I've included mentioning Jean Pascal Zadi's initiative there. I can remove it if we don't get permission. I think it flows nicely, however if by the end of today I don't hear back, then I won't say it. \nWill defer to Paula, but I don\u2019t think we received permission.\nI'd like to draw attention to the notes in slide 22. Here is where in the debrief we can mention \"must-haves\" vs. \"nice-to-haves\". However, would you like me to bring it up before sending them out into the breakout rooms? As a facilitator I'd like to see them come up with their own ideas and not provide an initial suggestion in case this primes them to think in a particular way. If you are comfortable with that then in the debrief, if they haven't discussed this idea on their own, I can bring it up and we can expand upon it. Is that alright?\u00a0\nIn thinking about it, we want to move away from the term \u201cmust-haves\u201d and \u201cnice to haves\u201d with this group. Let\u2019s keep the conversation framed to be focused on being thoughtful and as representative and authentic as possible without giving specific mandates. And yes, I agree that we can see what ideas they come up with first. \nLast but not least, Vince will be opening up the Zoom room and I'll likely be connecting at about 10 minutes before the start time because I'll be getting back then from teaching my class at Stanford University in Madrid. Vince will also have the pdf of the important content slides ready so that we can share them. \nGreat, I\u2019ll plan to be in 15 minutes prior. Are we able to record the presentation for those who are unable to attend?\n\u00a0\nThank you! I\u2019ll go through this in detail this morning and send any additional notes. \n\u00a0\nBest,\n\u00a0\nJeff\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\nFrom:\n Almendra Staffa-Healey <\na.staffahealey@lcwmail.com\n> \nSent:\n Friday, May 27, 2022 2:51 AM\nTo:\n Cafuir, Jeff (NBCUniversal) <\nJeff.Cafuir@nbcuni.com\n>; Pratt, Paula (NBCUniversal) <\npaula.pratt@nbcuni.com\n>; Tamara Thorpe <\nt.thorpe@lcwmail.com\n>; Vince Bongiovanni <\nv.bongiovanni@lcwmail.com\n>\nCc:\n Thao, Blia (NBCUniversal) <\nBlia.Thao@nbcuni.com\n>; Halloran, Tara (NBCUniversal) <\nTara.Halloran@nbcuni.com\n>\nSubject:\n [EXTERNAL] UPI/LCW Workshop #1 Powerpoint\n\u00a0\nDear Jeff and Paula,\nI'm sending the powerpoint via WeTransfer as it weights too much to attach it to this message. \nI've added the logos to the front slide and end slides.

I'm not sure if you'd like me to change the first so it looks more like the last, or if the Universal logo is ok on its own. Let me know and I can edit it again if necessary. \nYes, please make it similar to the last slide so that all logos are sized the same and next to each other. \nI've included the timeline slide at the end so that Paula can go over it in her closing of the workshop. \nGreat. \nI'd like to draw attention to the notes in slide 6. I've included mentioning Jean Pascal Zadi's initiative there. I can remove it if we don't get permission. I think it flows nicely, however if by the end of today I don't hear back, then I won't say it. \nWill defer to Paula, but I don\u2019t think we received permission.\nI'd like to draw attention to the notes in slide 22. Here is where in the debrief we can mention \"must-haves\" vs. \"nice-to-haves\". However, would you like me to bring it up before sending them out into the breakout rooms? As a facilitator I'd like to see them come up with their own ideas and not provide an initial suggestion in case this primes them to think in a particular way. If you are comfortable with that then in the debrief, if they haven't discussed this idea on their own, I can bring it up and we can expand upon it. Is that alright?\u00a0\nIn thinking about it, we want to move away from the term \u201cmust-haves\u201d and \u201cnice to haves\u201d with this group. Let\u2019s keep the conversation framed to be focused on being thoughtful and as representative and authentic as possible without giving specific mandates. And yes, I agree that we can see what ideas they come up with first. \nLast but not least, Vince will be opening up the Zoom room and I'll likely be connecting at about 10 minutes before the start time because I'll be getting back then from teaching my class at Stanford University in Madrid. Vince will also have the pdf of the important content slides ready so that we can share them. \nGreat, I\u2019ll plan to be in 15 minutes prior. Are we able to record the presentation for those who are unable to attend?\n\u00a0\nThank you!

I'm not sure if you'd like me to change the first so it looks more like the last, or if the Universal logo is ok on its own. Let me know and I can edit it again if necessary. \nYes, please make it similar to the last slide so that all logos are sized the same and next to each other. \nI've included the timeline slide at the end so that Paula can go over it in her closing of the workshop. \nGreat. \nI'd like to draw attention to the notes in slide 6. I've included mentioning Jean Pascal Zadi's initiative there. I can remove it if we don't get permission. I think it flows nicely, however if by the end of today I don't hear back, then I won't say it. \nWill defer to Paula, but I don\u2019t think we received permission.\nI'd like to draw attention to the notes in slide 22. Here is where in the debrief we can mention \"must-haves\" vs. \"nice-to-haves\". However, would you like me to bring it up before sending them out into the breakout rooms? As a facilitator I'd like to see them come up with their own ideas and not provide an initial suggestion in case this primes them to think in a particular way. If you are comfortable with that then in the debrief, if they haven't discussed this idea on their own, I can bring it up and we can expand upon it. Is that alright?\u00a0\nIn thinking about it, we want to move away from the term \u201cmust-haves\u201d and \u201cnice to haves\u201d with this group. Let\u2019s keep the conversation framed to be focused on being thoughtful and as representative and authentic as possible without giving specific mandates. And yes, I agree that we can see what ideas they come up with first. \nLast but not least, Vince will be opening up the Zoom room and I'll likely be connecting at about 10 minutes before the start time because I'll be getting back then from teaching my class at Stanford University in Madrid. Vince will also have the pdf of the important content slides ready so that we can share them. \nGreat, I\u2019ll plan to be in 15 minutes prior. Are we able to record the presentation for those who are unable to attend?\n\u00a0\nThank you! I\u2019ll go through this in detail this morning and send any additional notes. \n\u00a0\nBest,\n\u00a0\nJeff\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\nFrom:\n Almendra Staffa-Healey <\na.staffahealey@lcwmail.com\n> \nSent:\n Friday, May 27, 2022 2:51 AM\nTo:\n Cafuir, Jeff (NBCUniversal) <\nJeff.Cafuir@nbcuni.com\n>; Pratt, Paula (NBCUniversal) <\npaula.pratt@nbcuni.com\n>; Tamara Thorpe <\nt.thorpe@lcwmail.com\n>; Vince Bongiovanni <\nv.bongiovanni@lcwmail.com\n>\nCc:\n Thao, Blia (NBCUniversal) <\nBlia.Thao@nbcuni.com\n>; Halloran, Tara (NBCUniversal) <\nTara.Halloran@nbcuni.com\n>\nSubject:\n [EXTERNAL] UPI/LCW Workshop #1 Powerpoint\n\u00a0\nDear Jeff and Paula,\nI'm sending the powerpoint via WeTransfer as it weights too much to attach it to this message. \nI've added the logos to the front slide and end slides.

I'm not sure if you'd like me to change the first so it looks more like the last, or if the Universal logo is ok on its own.

Here is where in the debrief we can mention \"must-haves\" vs. \"nice-to-haves\". However, would you like me to bring it up before sending them out into the breakout rooms? As a facilitator I'd like to see them come up with their own ideas and not provide an initial suggestion in case this primes them to think in a particular way. If you are comfortable with that then in the debrief, if they haven't discussed this idea on their own, I can bring it up and we can expand upon it. Is that alright?\u00a0\nIn thinking about it, we want to move away from the term \u201cmust-haves\u201d and \u201cnice to haves\u201d with this group. Let\u2019s keep the conversation framed to be focused on being thoughtful and as representative and authentic as possible without giving specific mandates. And yes, I agree that we can see what ideas they come up with first. \nLast but not least, Vince will be opening up the Zoom room and I'll likely be connecting at about 10 minutes before the start time because I'll be getting back then from teaching my class at Stanford University in Madrid. Vince will also have the pdf of the important content slides ready so that we can share them. \nGreat, I\u2019ll plan to be in 15 minutes prior.

I'm not sure if you'd like me to change the first so it looks more like the last, or if the Universal logo is ok on its own. Let me know and I can edit it again if necessary. \nYes, please make it similar to the last slide so that all logos are sized the same and next to each other. \nI've included the timeline slide at the end so that Paula can go over it in her closing of the workshop. \nGreat. \nI'd like to draw attention to the notes in slide 6. I've included mentioning Jean Pascal Zadi's initiative there. I can remove it if we don't get permission. I think it flows nicely, however if by the end of today I don't hear back, then I won't say it. \nWill defer to Paula, but I don\u2019t think we received permission.\nI'd like to draw attention to the notes in slide 22. Here is where in the debrief we can mention \"must-haves\" vs. \"nice-to-haves\". However, would you like me to bring it up before sending them out into the breakout rooms? As a facilitator I'd like to see them come up with their own ideas and not provide an initial suggestion in case this primes them to think in a particular way. If you are comfortable with that then in the debrief, if they haven't discussed this idea on their own, I can bring it up and we can expand upon it. Is that alright?\u00a0\nIn thinking about it, we want to move away from the term \u201cmust-haves\u201d and \u201cnice to haves\u201d with this group. Let\u2019s keep the conversation framed to be focused on being thoughtful and as representative and authentic as possible without giving specific mandates. And yes, I agree that we can see what ideas they come up with first. \nLast but not least, Vince will be opening up the Zoom room and I'll likely be connecting at about 10 minutes before the start time because I'll be getting back then from teaching my class at Stanford University in Madrid. Vince will also have the pdf of the important content slides ready so that we can share them. \nGreat, I\u2019ll plan to be in 15 minutes prior. Are we able to record the presentation for those who are unable to attend?\n\u00a0\nThank you! I\u2019ll go through this in detail this morning and send any additional notes. \n\u00a0\nBest,\n\u00a0\nJeff\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\nFrom:\n Almendra Staffa-Healey <\na.staffahealey@lcwmail.com\n> \nSent:\n Friday, May 27, 2022 2:51 AM\nTo:\n Cafuir, Jeff (NBCUniversal) <\nJeff.Cafuir@nbcuni.com\n>; Pratt, Paula (NBCUniversal) <\npaula.pratt@nbcuni.com\n>; Tamara Thorpe <\nt.thorpe@lcwmail.com\n>; Vince Bongiovanni <\nv.bongiovanni@lcwmail.com\n>\nCc:\n Thao, Blia (NBCUniversal) <\nBlia.Thao@nbcuni.com\n>; Halloran, Tara (NBCUniversal) <\nTara.Halloran@nbcuni.com\n>\nSubject:\n [EXTERNAL] UPI/LCW Workshop #1 Powerpoint\n\u00a0\nDear Jeff and Paula,\nI'm sending the powerpoint via WeTransfer as it weights too much to attach it to this message. \nI've added the logos to the front slide and end slides.

I'm not sure if you'd like me to change the first so it looks more like the last, or if the Universal logo is ok on its own. Let me know and I can edit it again if necessary. \nYes, please make it similar to the last slide so that all logos are sized the same and next to each other. \nI've included the timeline slide at the end so that Paula can go over it in her closing of the workshop. \nGreat. \nI'd like to draw attention to the notes in slide 6. I've included mentioning Jean Pascal Zadi's initiative there. I can remove it if we don't get permission. I think it flows nicely, however if by the end of today I don't hear back, then I won't say it. \nWill defer to Paula, but I don\u2019t think we received permission.\nI'd like to draw attention to the notes in slide 22. Here is where in the debrief we can mention \"must-haves\" vs. \"nice-to-haves\". However, would you like me to bring it up before sending them out into the breakout rooms? As a facilitator I'd like to see them come up with their own ideas and not provide an initial suggestion in case this primes them to think in a particular way. If you are comfortable with that then in the debrief, if they haven't discussed this idea on their own, I can bring it up and we can expand upon it. Is that alright?\u00a0\nIn thinking about it, we want to move away from the term \u201cmust-haves\u201d and \u201cnice to haves\u201d with this group. Let\u2019s keep the conversation framed to be focused on being thoughtful and as representative and authentic as possible without giving specific mandates. And yes, I agree that we can see what ideas they come up with first. \nLast but not least, Vince will be opening up the Zoom room and I'll likely be connecting at about 10 minutes before the start time because I'll be getting back then from teaching my class at Stanford University in Madrid. Vince will also have the pdf of the important content slides ready so that we can share them. \nGreat, I\u2019ll plan to be in 15 minutes prior. Are we able to record the presentation for those who are unable to attend?\n\u00a0\nThank you! I\u2019ll go through this in detail this morning and send any additional notes. \n\u00a0\nBest,\n\u00a0\nJeff\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\nFrom:\n Almendra Staffa-Healey <\na.staffahealey@lcwmail.com\n> \nSent:\n Friday, May 27, 2022 2:51 AM\nTo:\n Cafuir, Jeff (NBCUniversal) <\nJeff.Cafuir@nbcuni.com\n>; Pratt, Paula (NBCUniversal) <\npaula.pratt@nbcuni.com\n>; Tamara Thorpe <\nt.thorpe@lcwmail.com\n>; Vince Bongiovanni <\nv.bongiovanni@lcwmail.com\n>\nCc:\n Thao, Blia (NBCUniversal) <\nBlia.Thao@nbcuni.com\n>; Halloran, Tara (NBCUniversal) <\nTara.Halloran@nbcuni.com\n>\nSubject:\n [EXTERNAL] UPI/LCW Workshop #1 Powerpoint\n\u00a0\nDear Jeff and Paula,\nI'm sending the powerpoint via WeTransfer as it weights too much to attach it to this message. \nI've added the logos to the front slide and end slides.

I'm not sure if you'd like me to change the first so it looks more like the last, or if the Universal logo is ok on its own. Let me know and I can edit it again if necessary. \nYes, please make it similar to the last slide so that all logos are sized the same and next to each other. \nI've included the timeline slide at the end so that Paula can go over it in her closing of the workshop. \nGreat. \nI'd like to draw attention to the notes in slide 6. I've included mentioning Jean Pascal Zadi's initiative there. I can remove it if we don't get permission. I think it flows nicely, however if by the end of today I don't hear back, then I won't say it. \nWill defer to Paula, but I don\u2019t think we received permission.\nI'd like to draw attention to the notes in slide 22. Here is where in the debrief we can mention \"must-haves\" vs. \"nice-to-haves\". However, would you like me to bring it up before sending them out into the breakout rooms? As a facilitator I'd like to see them come up with their own ideas and not provide an initial suggestion in case this primes them to think in a particular way. If you are comfortable with that then in the debrief, if they haven't discussed this idea on their own, I can bring it up and we can expand upon it. Is that alright?\u00a0\nIn thinking about it, we want to move away from the term \u201cmust-haves\u201d and \u201cnice to haves\u201d with this group. Let\u2019s keep the conversation framed to be focused on being thoughtful and as representative and authentic as possible without giving specific mandates. And yes, I agree that we can see what ideas they come up with first. \nLast but not least, Vince will be opening up the Zoom room and I'll likely be connecting at about 10 minutes before the start time because I'll be getting back then from teaching my class at Stanford University in Madrid. Vince will also have the pdf of the important content slides ready so that we can share them. \nGreat, I\u2019ll plan to be in 15 minutes prior. Are we able to record the presentation for those who are unable to attend?\n\u00a0\nThank you!

I'm not sure if you'd like me to change the first so it looks more like the last, or if the Universal logo is ok on its own. Let me know and I can edit it again if necessary. \nYes, please make it similar to the last slide so that all logos are sized the same and next to each other. \nI've included the timeline slide at the end so that Paula can go over it in her closing of the workshop. \nGreat. \nI'd like to draw attention to the notes in slide 6. I've included mentioning Jean Pascal Zadi's initiative there. I can remove it if we don't get permission. I think it flows nicely, however if by the end of today I don't hear back, then I won't say it. \nWill defer to Paula, but I don\u2019t think we received permission.\nI'd like to draw attention to the notes in slide 22. Here is where in the debrief we can mention \"must-haves\" vs. \"nice-to-haves\". However, would you like me to bring it up before sending them out into the breakout rooms? As a facilitator I'd like to see them come up with their own ideas and not provide an initial suggestion in case this primes them to think in a particular way. If you are comfortable with that then in the debrief, if they haven't discussed this idea on their own, I can bring it up and we can expand upon it. Is that alright?\u00a0\nIn thinking about it, we want to move away from the term \u201cmust-haves\u201d and \u201cnice to haves\u201d with this group. Let\u2019s keep the conversation framed to be focused on being thoughtful and as representative and authentic as possible without giving specific mandates. And yes, I agree that we can see what ideas they come up with first. \nLast but not least, Vince will be opening up the Zoom room and I'll likely be connecting at about 10 minutes before the start time because I'll be getting back then from teaching my class at Stanford University in Madrid. Vince will also have the pdf of the important content slides ready so that we can share them. \nGreat, I\u2019ll plan to be in 15 minutes prior. Are we able to record the presentation for those who are unable to attend?\n\u00a0\nThank you!

    "body": "Dear Jeff and Paula,\nI'm sending the powerpoint via WeTransfer as it weights too much to attach it to this message. \nI've added the logos to the front slide and end slides. I'm not sure if you'd like me to change the first so it looks more like the last, or if the Universal logo is ok on its own. Let me know and I can edit it again if necessary.\nI've included the timeline slide at the end so that Paula can go over it in her closing of the workshop.\nI'd like to draw attention to the notes in slide 6. I've included mentioning Jean Pascal Zadi's initiative there. I can remove it if we don't get permission. I think it flows nicely, however if by the end of today I don't hear back, then I won't say it.\nI'd like to draw attention to the notes in slide 22. Here is where in the debrief we can mention \"must-haves\" vs. \"nice-to-haves\". However, would you like me to bring it up before sending them out into the breakout rooms? As a facilitator I'd like to see them come up with their own ideas and not provide an initial suggestion in case this primes them to think in a particular way. If you are comfortable with that then in the debrief, if they haven't discussed this idea on their own, I can bring it up and we can expand upon it. Is that alright?\u00a0\nLast but not least, Vince will be opening up the Zoom room and I'll likely be connecting at about 10 minutes before the start time because I'll be getting back then from teaching my class at Stanford University in Madrid. Vince will also have the pdf of the important content slides ready so that we can share them.\nAll the\u00a0best,\nAlmendra",

As discussed, attached you\u2019ll find:\nItaly\u2019s DEI proposal for reference\nUniversal Pictures logo (blue) to add to the presentation deck cover and a white version to add to the closing slide. Can you also change the GTDI logo on the closing slide to the white version attached?\nI no longer have access to the clip and photo, but here is the context regarding Bad Guys in France:\n\u201cOur Star Talent Jean Pascal ZADI who plays the SHARK in Bad Guys hosted a very special private screening for all the kids from his children school. They are all from the suburb of Paris and some of them never had the opportunity to go to a theatre to see a movie. Jean Pascal had a very motivating, authentic and inspiring message for these kids saying that if \nHE\n could do a voice in a major US Hollywood animated movie, then everybody can.

    "body": "Hi Vince,\nI've only done one group debrief - for Ubisoft and it was only 1 hour. I did it alone, not co-facilitated. So, I don't know what the pay would be for a 2-hour co-facilitated session. I suggest you speak with Tamara and then let me know. I would be more comfortable with this. If you need me to supply a fee, though, do and I will get you a figure.\nWith regards to this Thursday at 4 pm my time, I'm teaching my Stanford class so I'm not available at that time. If you record the meeting, I could watch it and then meet if I have questions, or I can be briefed separately too.\nThank you,\nAlmendra\nFrom:\n Vince Bongiovanni <v.bongiovanni@lcwmail.com>\nSent:\n Tuesday, May 24, 2022 21:56\nTo:\n Almendra Staffa-Healey <a.staffahealey@lcwmail.com>\nSubject:\n RE: Facilitation Opportunity Confirmation\n \n\u00a0\nHi Almendra,\n\u00a0\nIt was nice seeing you earlier today.\n\u00a0\nThat is great news that you are available!

As discussed, attached you\u2019ll find:\nItaly\u2019s DEI proposal for reference\nUniversal Pictures logo (blue) to add to the presentation deck cover and a white version to add to the closing slide. Can you also change the GTDI logo on the closing slide to the white version attached?\nI no longer have access to the clip and photo, but here is the context regarding Bad Guys in France:\n\u201cOur Star Talent Jean Pascal ZADI who plays the SHARK in Bad Guys hosted a very special private screening for all the kids from his children school. They are all from the suburb of Paris and some of them never had the opportunity to go to a theatre to see a movie. Jean Pascal had a very motivating, authentic and inspiring message for these kids saying that if \nHE\n could do a voice in a major US Hollywood animated movie, then everybody can. I thought it is a perfect example of DEI activation in France\u2026The idea came when I was discussing with Jean-Pascal during the dubbing sessions about his background and the opportunities he encountered along his life. As we met again during the film\u2019s Premiere, we decided to organise a special screening with the children of Pantin to show them his work. Our theatre was packed last Wednesday afternoon with a very enthusiastic audience.\u201d\n\u00a0\nWe\u2019ll send over the timeline slide in the coming days, but please let me know if you need anything else. \n\u00a0\nBest,\n\u00a0\nJeff\n\u00a0\n-----Original Appointment-----\nFrom:\n Cafuir, Jeff (NBCUniversal) \nSent:\n Monday, May 16, 2022 2:33 PM\nTo:\n Cafuir, Jeff (NBCUniversal); Halloran, Tara (NBCUniversal); Tamara Thorpe; Vince Bongiovanni; Almendra Staffa-Healey; Pratt, Paula (NBCUniversal)\nCc:\n Schwartz, Joy (NBCUniversal); Thao, Blia (NBCUniversal)\nSubject:\n UPI/LCW Workshop #1 Prep Call (Likely only need 30 mins, but adding extra time just in case)\nWhen:\n Tuesday, May 24, 2022 9:30 AM-10:15 AM (UTC-08:00) Pacific Time (US & Canada).\nWhere:\n Microsoft Teams Meeting\n\u00a0\n(Likely only need 30 mins, but adding extra time just in case)\n________________________________________________________________________________\n \nMicrosoft Teams meeting\n \nJoin on your computer or mobile app\n \nClick here to join the meeting\n \nJoin with a video conferencing device\n \nnbcuni@m.webex.com\n \nVideo Conference ID: \n115 060 070 3 \nAlternate VTC instructions\n \nOr call in (audio only)\n \n+1 323-886-7533,,584553688#\n \n\u00a0 United States, Los Angeles \nPhone Conference ID: \n584 553 688# \nFind a local number\n | \nReset PIN\n \nLearn More\n | \nHelp\n | \nMeeting options\n \n________________________________________________________________________________",

It was great to get to know you better at last week\u2019s offsite. I was hoping to have a few moments to mention a project that I\u2019m working on, but it didn\u2019t arise. So here we go! \n\u00a0\nWe are working with NBCUniversal\u2019s International Theatrical Dubbing regional teams. I\u2019ve built a custom training for their regional managers that we will be delivering on May 31\nst\n.\u00a0 I sent the content over to the client yesterday and I don\u2019t anticipate much feedback; however, if there is any substantive changes that the client would like, I\u2019m hoping that you could take that on since I\u2019ll be out of the office until May 30\nth\n.\n\u00a0\nOne of our external partners, Almendra Staffa-Healy will be facilitating the training, and she is more than capable of making any small amendments or adjustments; however, I wanted to have you as a backup, just in case I totally got it wrong. The deck is here:\n\u00a0\nAnd Vince is the AC and can give you background on the client and the project. This training is the firs of two, the second will be delivered in the fall. I don\u2019t anticipate needing you, but I\u2019ve told Vince to reach out to you if the client comes back with requests for significant changes to the content.\n\u00a0\nBest case scenario, we won\u2019t need your help.
