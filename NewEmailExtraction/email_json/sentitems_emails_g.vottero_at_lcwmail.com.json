Here are a few things I picked up on in two courses that I\u2019d like to see if we can update. I\u2019m happy to get on a call to discuss if you\u2019d like!\n\u00a0\nIntroduction to Conscious Inclusion (Unconscious Bias)\nIn the attached Self Assess Common Microinequities resource guide, could all instances of \u201cmicroinequities\u201d be changed to \u201cmicroaggressions\u201d? We are trying to use that term more consistently at Moog now.\nIn the attached Building and Deepening Relationships resource guide, it mentions \u201cBRGs\u201d but they should be \u201cERGs\u201d.\n\u00a0\nFostering Collaboration\nOn page/slide 8, an example of Janet from Training is used. Could we change Training to Learning and Development? Our training team here is referred to as L&D.\nOn page/slide 8, can we change the example of utilizing a Team Operating Agreement to \"I act collaboratively when I ensure my teammates are aligned on expectations and level of support before starting a new project I'm leading.\"\nOn page/slide 9, can we change Training to learning and Development again?\nOn page/slide 14, it references the DIN model as though it was explained earlier in the video, but I didn\u2019t see that it was. We love the DIN model and would like to figure out how to teach it to employees \u2013 I\u2019m thinking we could either explain it in the video or take it out for now and teach employees another way. Do you have any thoughts?\n\u00a0\nThank you!\n\u00a0\nThank you,\nCrystal\n\u00a0\nCrystal Grasso, MBA, PHR |\n Sr. CG Learning and Development Program Specialist\nMoog Human Resources\nP: \n(716) 687-5843\nM: \n(716) 263-5341\nE:\n \ncturton@moog.com\n \n\u00a0\nThis document does not contain Technical Data or Technology as defined in the ITAR Part 120.10 or EAR Part 772\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\nConfidentiality Notice: This electronic mail transmission is intended for the use of the individual or entity to which it is addressed and may contain confidential and/or proprietary information belonging to the sender.

It also included setting up our vendor profile in their systems, which Nicole did and noted that operations would manage.\u00a0\nI've recently received an email that this system needs updating. Do you know who I should reach out to? Alternatively, I am more than happy to manage this myself for my clients, but would want to be sure to understand who can support with tricky questions. I will also- I believe- need help in resetting the account. Unless Nicole has already shared that account log in info? Their system is Aravo.\u00a0\nThank you in advance for your suggestions!\nBest,\nGrace\u00a0\nGrace Vottero\n(she/her/hers)\nConsultant",
