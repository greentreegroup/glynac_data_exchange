There are some time sensitive things coming up what we need work on, and we will need someone available 9-5 EST. Sorry for the last-minute change. I know you were set to speak with Kaitlin tomorrow. She will cancel that call. If anything changes, I'll let you know.\nThanks in advance for understanding!\nNicole",

We were just discussing the possibility of switching Canada\u2019s program to package their program as a cohort.

    "body": "Hi Rebecca: \n\u00a0\nSome responses and additional thoughts: \n\u00a0\nI don\u2019t have the talk track on the Barriers to Inclusion slide, but I agree with Lukeisha that I\u2019m not entirely sure it fits. What would it look like without identifiers? Can you share that please? \nYes\u2014I\u2019m good with the changes on the Platinum rule slide\nI also flagged for Lukeisha that Denial and Polarization examples. I really like the global example that you shared for Polarization and I think that\u2019s the winner. If you don\u2019t want it, I also think the Polarization can get the same treatment as denial \u201cWhy do we have to make a big deal out of cultural differences?\u201d I also think there is something off about the example of Adaptation. I\u2019m not sure what the examples have to do with working with the ERGs or increasing retention. Can this be made any clearer? \nFor other slides\u2014On slide 2 and 3 we say \u201cGroupM DEI Leads with Inclusion.\u201d Can this be changed to just \u201cGroupM Leads with Inclusion\u201d ? \nRegarding the introductory activity on slide 5, we\u2019re wondering if we need to change the speaker notes to remove the explicit instructions to avoid superficial ways of introducing themselves. If we stick with the example in the introduction (\u201c\nI\u2019m a returned ex-pat who lived and worked in Shanghai, China for a couple of years.\u201d) that might still accomplish the same tone without making some people uncomfortable about participating. \n\u00a0\nDo these changes make sense ?\n\u00a0\nBest,\nBrian\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\nBRIAN DASHEW \n(he/him)\nHead of Learning, North America\n\u2014\u00a0\nwww.groupm.com\n\u00a0\n@groupmworldwide\n\u00a0\nFollow us on LinkedIn\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\nFrom:\n Rebecca Parrilla <r.parrilla@lcwmail.com> \nSent:\n Monday, March 31, 2025 3:24 PM\nTo:\n Lukeisha Paul <Lukeisha.Paul@groupm.com>; Juri Mansour <j.mansour@lcwmail.com>; Safa Aamir <safa.aamir@groupm.com>; Brian Dashew <brian.dashew@groupm.com>; Shelton Rankin <shelton.rankin@groupm.com>\nSubject:\n RE: LCW x GroupM Meeting + Scheduling Sessions\n\u00a0\nExternal:\n \n\u00a0\nThank you. I found the details in \nthis article\n which summarizes things, and \nhere\n is the actual EEOC language. \n\u00a0\nThis part of the summary article is interesting:\nWith respect to training, the EEOC states that:\n\u201cDEI training\u00a0\nmay\u00a0\ngive rise to a \ncolorable\n hostile work environment claim\u201d; and\n\u201cReasonable opposition to a DEI training\u00a0\nmay\n\u00a0constitute protected activity.\u201d\n\u00a0\nI looked it up and a \"colorable hostile work environment claim\" refers to a situation where an employee alleges that their workplace has become abusive or intimidating due to unwelcome conduct based on their protected characteristic (like race, color, religion, sex, etc.) and that this conduct is severe or pervasive enough to create a hostile environment, potentially giving rise to a valid legal claim. There is NOTHING that I see in the content as-is that would reasonably be constituted as \u201cabusive or intimidating\u201d.\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\nMy POV regarding the three slides you sent through:\n\u00a0\nSlide 1 \u2013 I would recommend keeping this slide and removing the diversity identifiers on each quote. We want to make sure that we educate around the presence of all five of these barriers, which are not solely and exclusively experienced by POC, women, LGBTQ+, PwD or other non-dominant groups. They are experienced by people of ALL backgrounds. We know that often they are experienced more often by people of non-dominant groups, but everyone can think of examples where they were afraid of being stereotyped, where they covered, where they experienced greater scrutiny, etc. \n\u00a0\nSlide 2- No, the religious reference is not necessary, I will delete it. I will change the image \u2013 is this image okay?\n\u00a0\nSlide 3 \u2013 \nfor Denial, I will change the quote to \u201cI\u2019m not sure why we \nneed to learn about people\u2019s different cultures\n. If people really want to work here, then they\u2019ll stay here. If they leave then they probably weren\u2019t a good fit anyway.\u201d\u00a0 \nMay I ask for the reasoning behind having a different example of Polarization is required? Currently it\u2019s \u201cWhy do we have to say our pronouns? All for a few people who insist on complicating things - why should they receive special treatment?\u201d At any rate, a different example could be: \u201cI just don\u2019t understand why some global teams don\u2019t ask questions during project meetings, it\u2019s so counterproductive and irritating!\u201d\nRe: Debrief poll for acceptance / adaptation coming across as leading and judgmental, we do objectively know that most people who self assess in the intercultural mindsets are in fact in Minimization, but we don\u2019t have to say that. I will change the speaker notes to simply reiterate what acceptance and adaptation mean, and encourage people to continue practicing understanding and bridging. \n\u00a0\nBest, \nRebecca\n\u00a0\nRebecca M.

I found the details in \nthis article\n which summarizes things, and \nhere\n is the actual EEOC language. \n\u00a0\nThis part of the summary article is interesting:\nWith respect to training, the EEOC states that:\n\u201cDEI training\u00a0\nmay\u00a0\ngive rise to a \ncolorable\n hostile work environment claim\u201d; and\n\u201cReasonable opposition to a DEI training\u00a0\nmay\n\u00a0constitute protected activity.\u201d\n\u00a0\nI looked it up and a \"colorable hostile work environment claim\" refers to a situation where an employee alleges that their workplace has become abusive or intimidating due to unwelcome conduct based on their protected characteristic (like race, color, religion, sex, etc.) and that this conduct is severe or pervasive enough to create a hostile environment, potentially giving rise to a valid legal claim. There is NOTHING that I see in the content as-is that would reasonably be constituted as \u201cabusive or intimidating\u201d.\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\nMy POV regarding the three slides you sent through:\n\u00a0\nSlide 1 \u2013 I would recommend keeping this slide and removing the diversity identifiers on each quote. We want to make sure that we educate around the presence of all five of these barriers, which are not solely and exclusively experienced by POC, women, LGBTQ+, PwD or other non-dominant groups. They are experienced by people of ALL backgrounds. We know that often they are experienced more often by people of non-dominant groups, but everyone can think of examples where they were afraid of being stereotyped, where they covered, where they experienced greater scrutiny, etc. \n\u00a0\nSlide 2- No, the religious reference is not necessary, I will delete it. I will change the image \u2013 is this image okay?\n\u00a0\nSlide 3 \u2013 \nfor Denial, I will change the quote to \u201cI\u2019m not sure why we \nneed to learn about people\u2019s different cultures\n. If people really want to work here, then they\u2019ll stay here. If they leave then they probably weren\u2019t a good fit anyway.\u201d\u00a0 \nMay I ask for the reasoning behind having a different example of Polarization is required? Currently it\u2019s \u201cWhy do we have to say our pronouns? All for a few people who insist on complicating things - why should they receive special treatment?\u201d At any rate, a different example could be: \u201cI just don\u2019t understand why some global teams don\u2019t ask questions during project meetings, it\u2019s so counterproductive and irritating!\u201d\nRe: Debrief poll for acceptance / adaptation coming across as leading and judgmental, we do objectively know that most people who self assess in the intercultural mindsets are in fact in Minimization, but we don\u2019t have to say that. I will change the speaker notes to simply reiterate what acceptance and adaptation mean, and encourage people to continue practicing understanding and bridging. \n\u00a0\nBest, \nRebecca\n\u00a0\nRebecca M.

    "body": "Thank you. I found the details in \nthis article\n which summarizes things, and \nhere\n is the actual EEOC language. \n\u00a0\nThis part of the summary article is interesting:\nWith respect to training, the EEOC states that:\n\u201cDEI training\u00a0\nmay\u00a0\ngive rise to a \ncolorable\n hostile work environment claim\u201d; and\n\u201cReasonable opposition to a DEI training\u00a0\nmay\n\u00a0constitute protected activity.\u201d\n\u00a0\nI looked it up and a \"colorable hostile work environment claim\" refers to a situation where an employee alleges that their workplace has become abusive or intimidating due to unwelcome conduct based on their protected characteristic (like race, color, religion, sex, etc.) and that this conduct is severe or pervasive enough to create a hostile environment, potentially giving rise to a valid legal claim. There is NOTHING that I see in the content as-is that would reasonably be constituted as \u201cabusive or intimidating\u201d.\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\nMy POV regarding the three slides you sent through:\n\u00a0\nSlide 1 \u2013 I would recommend keeping this slide and removing the diversity identifiers on each quote. We want to make sure that we educate around the presence of all five of these barriers, which are not solely and exclusively experienced by POC, women, LGBTQ+, PwD or other non-dominant groups. They are experienced by people of ALL backgrounds. We know that often they are experienced more often by people of non-dominant groups, but everyone can think of examples where they were afraid of being stereotyped, where they covered, where they experienced greater scrutiny, etc. \n\u00a0\nSlide 2- No, the religious reference is not necessary, I will delete it. I will change the image \u2013 is this image okay?\n\u00a0\nSlide 3 \u2013 \nfor Denial, I will change the quote to \u201cI\u2019m not sure why we \nneed to learn about people\u2019s different cultures\n. If people really want to work here, then they\u2019ll stay here. If they leave then they probably weren\u2019t a good fit anyway.\u201d\u00a0 \nMay I ask for the reasoning behind having a different example of Polarization is required? Currently it\u2019s \u201cWhy do we have to say our pronouns? All for a few people who insist on complicating things - why should they receive special treatment?\u201d At any rate, a different example could be: \u201cI just don\u2019t understand why some global teams don\u2019t ask questions during project meetings, it\u2019s so counterproductive and irritating!\u201d\nRe: Debrief poll for acceptance / adaptation coming across as leading and judgmental, we do objectively know that most people who self assess in the intercultural mindsets are in fact in Minimization, but we don\u2019t have to say that. I will change the speaker notes to simply reiterate what acceptance and adaptation mean, and encourage people to continue practicing understanding and bridging. \n\u00a0\nBest, \nRebecca\n\u00a0\nRebecca M.

They can only choose one date and time on the registrant page. If the registrant cancels, they will need to re-register to attend any future sessions.\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u2002\u20022. Registrant cancellations: \u00a0Zoom does NOT send an email to the host when a registrant cancels their \u2002\u2002\u2002\u2002registration. The host has to manually check the registrant list within the Zoom web portal to see who \u2002\u2002\u2002\u2002has cancelled.\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u2002\u2002\u2002\u2002We can pull registration reports- would you want to pull this information in the same cadence of \u2002\u2002\u2002\u2002\u2002\u2002\u2002sending the reminders?

While the Zoom link does prompt users to add the item to their calendar (which happens automatically once the user selects to add the event), there is unfortunately no easy way for their registration to automatically trigger the calendar event creation. \n\u00a0\nThat effectively leaves us with two options: \nUse Zoom registrations which will address the issue of logins and email fidelity, but which requires the user to select the option to have the calendar event created\nUse EventBrite which will address the issue of calendar notifications, but which will leave the problem of logins in place. \n\u00a0\nMy recommendation is that the Zoom registration option has enough practical benefits that it outweighs the potential risk of users needing to select for the calendar invitation. This is especially true because it would still send automatic notifications of enrollment and reminder messages. I do caveat this recommendation with two things: \n\u00a0\nI think we should revisit after the first round of enrollments. If we find that we have seen a precipitous drop in attendance from enrollment (e.g. 80%) then I think we should revert to the EventBrite approach. \nWe have asked for LCW to also confirm that a) we can limit the number of sessions an individual can enroll for, and b) they can cancel registrations if they are unable to attend\n\u00a0\nWanted to check with you before we move this ahead. Are you comfortable with this approach? \n\u00a0\nBest,\nBrian\n\u00a0\nBRIAN DASHEW \n(he/him)\nHead of Learning, North America\n\u2014\u00a0\nwww.groupm.com\n\u00a0\n@groupmworldwide\n\u00a0\nFollow us on LinkedIn\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\nDisclaimer\nThe information contained in this communication from the sender is confidential.

One thing I was looking forward to pinning down today was the \nstart of session deployment\n. \n\u00a0\nI\u2019m so sorry but it\u2019s become very hard for us as a small firm to continue reserving resources (facilitators) on particular dates/times only to postpone since mid-February, and at this point it\u2019s a high priority item for LCW and our CEO to get the sessions hard-scheduled asap. \u00a0\nCan we say with certainty that the first sessions will take place on Friday, May 2\nnd\n?\n \n\u00a0\nI thought it would be helpful to also review the cancellations and postponement language in the SOW \u2013 I will waive the fees that would have been incurred re: the last bullet up until now:\n\u00a0\nCancelations\n \n&\n \nPostponements:\nScheduled sessions may be canceled or postponed at any time before scheduled delivery at no cost, providing the session is rescheduled within six months, any non-refundable travel expenses will still be billed\nScheduled sessions canceled or postponed within 8-14 days of delivery, if not rescheduled, will incur a charge of 50% of the session cost, plus any non-refundable travel expenses\nScheduled sessions canceled or postponed within 3-7 days of delivery, if not rescheduled, will incur a charge of 75% of the session cost, plus any non-refundable travel expenses\nScheduled sessions canceled or postponed within 2 days of delivery, if not rescheduled will incur a charge of the full program fee, plus any non-refundable travel expenses\nCancellation and postponement charges will be invoiced immediately and may not be applied to future sessions Cancellation & postponement fees are in addition to the original session fees\nScheduled sessions postponed more than twice, no matter the notice, will incur a charge of 50% of the session cost, plus any non-refundable travel expenses\n\u00a0\nIf we believe a meeting is necessary to talk about the above, I\u2019d prefer the meeting be held sooner rather than later.\n\u00a0\nThanks, and I look forward to your response!\nBest, \nRebecca\n\u00a0\nRebecca M.

One thing I was looking forward to pinning down today was the \nstart of session deployment\n. \n\u00a0\nI\u2019m so sorry but it\u2019s become very hard for us as a small firm to continue reserving resources (facilitators) on particular dates/times only to postpone since mid-February, and at this point it\u2019s a high priority item for LCW and our CEO to get the sessions hard-scheduled asap. \u00a0\nCan we say with certainty that the first sessions will take place on Friday, May 2\nnd\n?\n \n\u00a0\nI thought it would be helpful to also review the cancellations and postponement language in the SOW \u2013 I will waive the fees that would have been incurred re: the last bullet up until now:\n\u00a0\nCancelations\n \n&\n \nPostponements:\nScheduled sessions may be canceled or postponed at any time before scheduled delivery at no cost, providing the session is rescheduled within six months, any non-refundable travel expenses will still be billed\nScheduled sessions canceled or postponed within 8-14 days of delivery, if not rescheduled, will incur a charge of 50% of the session cost, plus any non-refundable travel expenses\nScheduled sessions canceled or postponed within 3-7 days of delivery, if not rescheduled, will incur a charge of 75% of the session cost, plus any non-refundable travel expenses\nScheduled sessions canceled or postponed within 2 days of delivery, if not rescheduled will incur a charge of the full program fee, plus any non-refundable travel expenses\nCancellation and postponement charges will be invoiced immediately and may not be applied to future sessions Cancellation & postponement fees are in addition to the original session fees\nScheduled sessions postponed more than twice, no matter the notice, will incur a charge of 50% of the session cost, plus any non-refundable travel expenses\n\u00a0\nIf we believe a meeting is necessary to talk about the above, I\u2019d prefer the meeting be held sooner rather than later.\n\u00a0\nThanks, and I look forward to your response!\nBest, \nRebecca\n\u00a0\nRebecca M.

They can only choose one date and time on the registrant page. If the registrant cancels, they will need to re-register to attend any future sessions.\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u2002\u20022. Registrant cancellations: \u00a0Zoom does NOT send an email to the host when a registrant cancels their \u2002\u2002\u2002\u2002registration. The host has to manually check the registrant list within the Zoom web portal to see who \u2002\u2002\u2002\u2002has cancelled.\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u2002\u2002\u2002\u2002We can pull registration reports- would you want to pull this information in the same cadence of \u2002\u2002\u2002\u2002\u2002\u2002\u2002sending the reminders? Shelton shared that the session reminders cadence would be 5\u00a0 days prior \u2002\u2002\u2002\u2002\u2002\u2002to a session, 3 days prior to a session, and 1 day prior to a session.\u00a0 Please confirm.\n\u00a0\nThanks!\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\nJuri Mansour (She/Her)\nConsultant Project Associate\nLCW\nFrom:\n Brian Dashew <\nbrian.dashew@groupm.com\n>\nSent:\n Wednesday, March 26, 2025 8:43 AM\nTo:\n Lukeisha Paul <\nLukeisha.Paul@groupm.com\n>; Shelton Rankin <\nshelton.rankin@groupm.com\n>; Juri Mansour <\nj.mansour@lcwmail.com\n>; Rebecca Parrilla <\nr.parrilla@lcwmail.com\n>\nSubject:\n Recommendation on Culture of Inclusion program enrollment\n \n\u00a0\nHi Lukeisha: \n\u00a0\nI met this morning with Shelton and the LCW team to go over the possibility of automatic calendar notifications through the Zoom enrollment process. While the Zoom link does prompt users to add the item to their calendar (which happens automatically once the user selects to add the event), there is unfortunately no easy way for their registration to automatically trigger the calendar event creation. \n\u00a0\nThat effectively leaves us with two options: \nUse Zoom registrations which will address the issue of logins and email fidelity, but which requires the user to select the option to have the calendar event created\nUse EventBrite which will address the issue of calendar notifications, but which will leave the problem of logins in place. \n\u00a0\nMy recommendation is that the Zoom registration option has enough practical benefits that it outweighs the potential risk of users needing to select for the calendar invitation. This is especially true because it would still send automatic notifications of enrollment and reminder messages. I do caveat this recommendation with two things: \n\u00a0\nI think we should revisit after the first round of enrollments. If we find that we have seen a precipitous drop in attendance from enrollment (e.g. 80%) then I think we should revert to the EventBrite approach. \nWe have asked for LCW to also confirm that a) we can limit the number of sessions an individual can enroll for, and b) they can cancel registrations if they are unable to attend\n\u00a0\nWanted to check with you before we move this ahead. Are you comfortable with this approach? \n\u00a0\nBest,\nBrian\n\u00a0\nBRIAN DASHEW \n(he/him)\nHead of Learning, North America\n\u2014\u00a0\nwww.groupm.com\n\u00a0\n@groupmworldwide\n\u00a0\nFollow us on LinkedIn\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\nDisclaimer\nThe information contained in this communication from the sender is confidential.

They can only choose one date and time on the registrant page. If the registrant cancels, they will need to re-register to attend any future sessions.\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u2002\u20022. Registrant cancellations: \u00a0Zoom does NOT send an email to the host when a registrant cancels their \u2002\u2002\u2002\u2002registration. The host has to manually check the registrant list within the Zoom web portal to see who \u2002\u2002\u2002\u2002has cancelled.\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u2002\u2002\u2002\u2002We can pull registration reports- would you want to pull this information in the same cadence of \u2002\u2002\u2002\u2002\u2002\u2002\u2002sending the reminders? Shelton shared that the session reminders cadence would be 5\u00a0 days prior \u2002\u2002\u2002\u2002\u2002\u2002to a session, 3 days prior to a session, and 1 day prior to a session.\u00a0 Please confirm.\n\u00a0\nThanks!\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\nJuri Mansour (She/Her)\nConsultant Project Associate\nLCW\nFrom:\n Brian Dashew <\nbrian.dashew@groupm.com\n>\nSent:\n Wednesday, March 26, 2025 8:43 AM\nTo:\n Lukeisha Paul <\nLukeisha.Paul@groupm.com\n>; Shelton Rankin <\nshelton.rankin@groupm.com\n>; Juri Mansour <\nj.mansour@lcwmail.com\n>; Rebecca Parrilla <\nr.parrilla@lcwmail.com\n>\nSubject:\n Recommendation on Culture of Inclusion program enrollment\n \n\u00a0\nHi Lukeisha: \n\u00a0\nI met this morning with Shelton and the LCW team to go over the possibility of automatic calendar notifications through the Zoom enrollment process. While the Zoom link does prompt users to add the item to their calendar (which happens automatically once the user selects to add the event), there is unfortunately no easy way for their registration to automatically trigger the calendar event creation. \n\u00a0\nThat effectively leaves us with two options: \nUse Zoom registrations which will address the issue of logins and email fidelity, but which requires the user to select the option to have the calendar event created\nUse EventBrite which will address the issue of calendar notifications, but which will leave the problem of logins in place. \n\u00a0\nMy recommendation is that the Zoom registration option has enough practical benefits that it outweighs the potential risk of users needing to select for the calendar invitation. This is especially true because it would still send automatic notifications of enrollment and reminder messages. I do caveat this recommendation with two things: \n\u00a0\nI think we should revisit after the first round of enrollments. If we find that we have seen a precipitous drop in attendance from enrollment (e.g. 80%) then I think we should revert to the EventBrite approach. \nWe have asked for LCW to also confirm that a) we can limit the number of sessions an individual can enroll for, and b) they can cancel registrations if they are unable to attend\n\u00a0\nWanted to check with you before we move this ahead. Are you comfortable with this approach? \n\u00a0\nBest,\nBrian\n\u00a0\nBRIAN DASHEW \n(he/him)\nHead of Learning, North America\n\u2014\u00a0\nwww.groupm.com\n\u00a0\n@groupmworldwide\n\u00a0\nFollow us on LinkedIn\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\nDisclaimer\nThe information contained in this communication from the sender is confidential.
