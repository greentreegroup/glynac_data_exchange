    "body": "Hi Rebecca: \n\u00a0\nSome responses and additional thoughts: \n\u00a0\nI don\u2019t have the talk track on the Barriers to Inclusion slide, but I agree with Lukeisha that I\u2019m not entirely sure it fits. What would it look like without identifiers? Can you share that please? \nYes\u2014I\u2019m good with the changes on the Platinum rule slide\nI also flagged for Lukeisha that Denial and Polarization examples. I really like the global example that you shared for Polarization and I think that\u2019s the winner. If you don\u2019t want it, I also think the Polarization can get the same treatment as denial \u201cWhy do we have to make a big deal out of cultural differences?\u201d I also think there is something off about the example of Adaptation. I\u2019m not sure what the examples have to do with working with the ERGs or increasing retention. Can this be made any clearer? \nFor other slides\u2014On slide 2 and 3 we say \u201cGroupM DEI Leads with Inclusion.\u201d Can this be changed to just \u201cGroupM Leads with Inclusion\u201d ? \nRegarding the introductory activity on slide 5, we\u2019re wondering if we need to change the speaker notes to remove the explicit instructions to avoid superficial ways of introducing themselves. If we stick with the example in the introduction (\u201c\nI\u2019m a returned ex-pat who lived and worked in Shanghai, China for a couple of years.\u201d) that might still accomplish the same tone without making some people uncomfortable about participating. \n\u00a0\nDo these changes make sense ?\n\u00a0\nBest,\nBrian\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\nBRIAN DASHEW \n(he/him)\nHead of Learning, North America\n\u2014\u00a0\nwww.groupm.com\n\u00a0\n@groupmworldwide\n\u00a0\nFollow us on LinkedIn\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\nFrom:\n Rebecca Parrilla <r.parrilla@lcwmail.com> \nSent:\n Monday, March 31, 2025 3:24 PM\nTo:\n Lukeisha Paul <Lukeisha.Paul@groupm.com>; Juri Mansour <j.mansour@lcwmail.com>; Safa Aamir <safa.aamir@groupm.com>; Brian Dashew <brian.dashew@groupm.com>; Shelton Rankin <shelton.rankin@groupm.com>\nSubject:\n RE: LCW x GroupM Meeting + Scheduling Sessions\n\u00a0\nExternal:\n \n\u00a0\nThank you. I found the details in \nthis article\n which summarizes things, and \nhere\n is the actual EEOC language. \n\u00a0\nThis part of the summary article is interesting:\nWith respect to training, the EEOC states that:\n\u201cDEI training\u00a0\nmay\u00a0\ngive rise to a \ncolorable\n hostile work environment claim\u201d; and\n\u201cReasonable opposition to a DEI training\u00a0\nmay\n\u00a0constitute protected activity.\u201d\n\u00a0\nI looked it up and a \"colorable hostile work environment claim\" refers to a situation where an employee alleges that their workplace has become abusive or intimidating due to unwelcome conduct based on their protected characteristic (like race, color, religion, sex, etc.) and that this conduct is severe or pervasive enough to create a hostile environment, potentially giving rise to a valid legal claim. There is NOTHING that I see in the content as-is that would reasonably be constituted as \u201cabusive or intimidating\u201d.\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\nMy POV regarding the three slides you sent through:\n\u00a0\nSlide 1 \u2013 I would recommend keeping this slide and removing the diversity identifiers on each quote. We want to make sure that we educate around the presence of all five of these barriers, which are not solely and exclusively experienced by POC, women, LGBTQ+, PwD or other non-dominant groups. They are experienced by people of ALL backgrounds. We know that often they are experienced more often by people of non-dominant groups, but everyone can think of examples where they were afraid of being stereotyped, where they covered, where they experienced greater scrutiny, etc. \n\u00a0\nSlide 2- No, the religious reference is not necessary, I will delete it. I will change the image \u2013 is this image okay?\n\u00a0\nSlide 3 \u2013 \nfor Denial, I will change the quote to \u201cI\u2019m not sure why we \nneed to learn about people\u2019s different cultures\n. If people really want to work here, then they\u2019ll stay here. If they leave then they probably weren\u2019t a good fit anyway.\u201d\u00a0 \nMay I ask for the reasoning behind having a different example of Polarization is required? Currently it\u2019s \u201cWhy do we have to say our pronouns? All for a few people who insist on complicating things - why should they receive special treatment?\u201d At any rate, a different example could be: \u201cI just don\u2019t understand why some global teams don\u2019t ask questions during project meetings, it\u2019s so counterproductive and irritating!\u201d\nRe: Debrief poll for acceptance / adaptation coming across as leading and judgmental, we do objectively know that most people who self assess in the intercultural mindsets are in fact in Minimization, but we don\u2019t have to say that. I will change the speaker notes to simply reiterate what acceptance and adaptation mean, and encourage people to continue practicing understanding and bridging. \n\u00a0\nBest, \nRebecca\n\u00a0\nRebecca M.

One thing I was looking forward to pinning down today was the \nstart of session deployment\n. \n\u00a0\nI\u2019m so sorry but it\u2019s become very hard for us as a small firm to continue reserving resources (facilitators) on particular dates/times only to postpone since mid-February, and at this point it\u2019s a high priority item for LCW and our CEO to get the sessions hard-scheduled asap. \u00a0\nCan we say with certainty that the first sessions will take place on Friday, May 2\nnd\n?\n \n\u00a0\nI thought it would be helpful to also review the cancellations and postponement language in the SOW \u2013 I will waive the fees that would have been incurred re: the last bullet up until now:\n\u00a0\nCancelations\n \n&\n \nPostponements:\nScheduled sessions may be canceled or postponed at any time before scheduled delivery at no cost, providing the session is rescheduled within six months, any non-refundable travel expenses will still be billed\nScheduled sessions canceled or postponed within 8-14 days of delivery, if not rescheduled, will incur a charge of 50% of the session cost, plus any non-refundable travel expenses\nScheduled sessions canceled or postponed within 3-7 days of delivery, if not rescheduled, will incur a charge of 75% of the session cost, plus any non-refundable travel expenses\nScheduled sessions canceled or postponed within 2 days of delivery, if not rescheduled will incur a charge of the full program fee, plus any non-refundable travel expenses\nCancellation and postponement charges will be invoiced immediately and may not be applied to future sessions Cancellation & postponement fees are in addition to the original session fees\nScheduled sessions postponed more than twice, no matter the notice, will incur a charge of 50% of the session cost, plus any non-refundable travel expenses\n\u00a0\nIf we believe a meeting is necessary to talk about the above, I\u2019d prefer the meeting be held sooner rather than later.\n\u00a0\nThanks, and I look forward to your response!\nBest, \nRebecca\n\u00a0\nRebecca M.

Parrilla\n \n(MBA, Latina, LGBTQ, Mom)\n(she/her) \nWhy pronouns matter\nHead of Client Solutions\nLCW\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\nFrom:\n Rebecca Parrilla \nSent:\n Monday, March 31, 2025 3:24 PM\nTo:\n Lukeisha Paul <Lukeisha.Paul@groupm.com>; Juri Mansour <j.mansour@lcwmail.com>; Safa Aamir <safa.aamir@groupm.com>; Brian Dashew <brian.dashew@groupm.com>; Shelton Rankin <shelton.rankin@groupm.com>\nSubject:\n RE: LCW x GroupM Meeting + Scheduling Sessions\n\u00a0\nThank you. I found the details in \nthis article\n which summarizes things, and \nhere\n is the actual EEOC language. \n\u00a0\nThis part of the summary article is interesting:\nWith respect to training, the EEOC states that:\n\u201cDEI training\u00a0\nmay\u00a0\ngive rise to a \ncolorable\n hostile work environment claim\u201d; and\n\u201cReasonable opposition to a DEI training\u00a0\nmay\n\u00a0constitute protected activity.\u201d\n\u00a0\nI looked it up and a \"colorable hostile work environment claim\" refers to a situation where an employee alleges that their workplace has become abusive or intimidating due to unwelcome conduct based on their protected characteristic (like race, color, religion, sex, etc.) and that this conduct is severe or pervasive enough to create a hostile environment, potentially giving rise to a valid legal claim. There is NOTHING that I see in the content as-is that would reasonably be constituted as \u201cabusive or intimidating\u201d.\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\nMy POV regarding the three slides you sent through:\n\u00a0\nSlide 1 \u2013 I would recommend keeping this slide and removing the diversity identifiers on each quote. We want to make sure that we educate around the presence of all five of these barriers, which are not solely and exclusively experienced by POC, women, LGBTQ+, PwD or other non-dominant groups. They are experienced by people of ALL backgrounds. We know that often they are experienced more often by people of non-dominant groups, but everyone can think of examples where they were afraid of being stereotyped, where they covered, where they experienced greater scrutiny, etc. \n\u00a0\nSlide 2- No, the religious reference is not necessary, I will delete it. I will change the image \u2013 is this image okay?\n\u00a0\nSlide 3 \u2013 \nfor Denial, I will change the quote to \u201cI\u2019m not sure why we \nneed to learn about people\u2019s different cultures\n. If people really want to work here, then they\u2019ll stay here. If they leave then they probably weren\u2019t a good fit anyway.\u201d\u00a0 \nMay I ask for the reasoning behind having a different example of Polarization is required? Currently it\u2019s \u201cWhy do we have to say our pronouns? All for a few people who insist on complicating things - why should they receive special treatment?\u201d At any rate, a different example could be: \u201cI just don\u2019t understand why some global teams don\u2019t ask questions during project meetings, it\u2019s so counterproductive and irritating!\u201d\nRe: Debrief poll for acceptance / adaptation coming across as leading and judgmental, we do objectively know that most people who self assess in the intercultural mindsets are in fact in Minimization, but we don\u2019t have to say that. I will change the speaker notes to simply reiterate what acceptance and adaptation mean, and encourage people to continue practicing understanding and bridging. \n\u00a0\nBest, \nRebecca\n\u00a0\nRebecca M.

One thing I was looking forward to pinning down today was the \nstart of session deployment\n. \n\u00a0\nI\u2019m so sorry but it\u2019s become very hard for us as a small firm to continue reserving resources (facilitators) on particular dates/times only to postpone since mid-February, and at this point it\u2019s a high priority item for LCW and our CEO to get the sessions hard-scheduled asap. \u00a0\nCan we say with certainty that the first sessions will take place on Friday, May 2\nnd\n?\n \n\u00a0\nI thought it would be helpful to also review the cancellations and postponement language in the SOW \u2013 I will waive the fees that would have been incurred re: the last bullet up until now:\n\u00a0\nCancelations\n \n&\n \nPostponements:\nScheduled sessions may be canceled or postponed at any time before scheduled delivery at no cost, providing the session is rescheduled within six months, any non-refundable travel expenses will still be billed\nScheduled sessions canceled or postponed within 8-14 days of delivery, if not rescheduled, will incur a charge of 50% of the session cost, plus any non-refundable travel expenses\nScheduled sessions canceled or postponed within 3-7 days of delivery, if not rescheduled, will incur a charge of 75% of the session cost, plus any non-refundable travel expenses\nScheduled sessions canceled or postponed within 2 days of delivery, if not rescheduled will incur a charge of the full program fee, plus any non-refundable travel expenses\nCancellation and postponement charges will be invoiced immediately and may not be applied to future sessions Cancellation & postponement fees are in addition to the original session fees\nScheduled sessions postponed more than twice, no matter the notice, will incur a charge of 50% of the session cost, plus any non-refundable travel expenses\n\u00a0\nIf we believe a meeting is necessary to talk about the above, I\u2019d prefer the meeting be held sooner rather than later.\n\u00a0\nThanks, and I look forward to your response!\nBest, \nRebecca\n\u00a0\nRebecca M.

    "body": "Thank you. I found the details in \nthis article\n which summarizes things, and \nhere\n is the actual EEOC language. \n\u00a0\nThis part of the summary article is interesting:\nWith respect to training, the EEOC states that:\n\u201cDEI training\u00a0\nmay\u00a0\ngive rise to a \ncolorable\n hostile work environment claim\u201d; and\n\u201cReasonable opposition to a DEI training\u00a0\nmay\n\u00a0constitute protected activity.\u201d\n\u00a0\nI looked it up and a \"colorable hostile work environment claim\" refers to a situation where an employee alleges that their workplace has become abusive or intimidating due to unwelcome conduct based on their protected characteristic (like race, color, religion, sex, etc.) and that this conduct is severe or pervasive enough to create a hostile environment, potentially giving rise to a valid legal claim. There is NOTHING that I see in the content as-is that would reasonably be constituted as \u201cabusive or intimidating\u201d.\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\nMy POV regarding the three slides you sent through:\n\u00a0\nSlide 1 \u2013 I would recommend keeping this slide and removing the diversity identifiers on each quote. We want to make sure that we educate around the presence of all five of these barriers, which are not solely and exclusively experienced by POC, women, LGBTQ+, PwD or other non-dominant groups. They are experienced by people of ALL backgrounds. We know that often they are experienced more often by people of non-dominant groups, but everyone can think of examples where they were afraid of being stereotyped, where they covered, where they experienced greater scrutiny, etc. \n\u00a0\nSlide 2- No, the religious reference is not necessary, I will delete it. I will change the image \u2013 is this image okay?\n\u00a0\nSlide 3 \u2013 \nfor Denial, I will change the quote to \u201cI\u2019m not sure why we \nneed to learn about people\u2019s different cultures\n. If people really want to work here, then they\u2019ll stay here. If they leave then they probably weren\u2019t a good fit anyway.\u201d\u00a0 \nMay I ask for the reasoning behind having a different example of Polarization is required? Currently it\u2019s \u201cWhy do we have to say our pronouns? All for a few people who insist on complicating things - why should they receive special treatment?\u201d At any rate, a different example could be: \u201cI just don\u2019t understand why some global teams don\u2019t ask questions during project meetings, it\u2019s so counterproductive and irritating!\u201d\nRe: Debrief poll for acceptance / adaptation coming across as leading and judgmental, we do objectively know that most people who self assess in the intercultural mindsets are in fact in Minimization, but we don\u2019t have to say that. I will change the speaker notes to simply reiterate what acceptance and adaptation mean, and encourage people to continue practicing understanding and bridging. \n\u00a0\nBest, \nRebecca\n\u00a0\nRebecca M.

One thing I was looking forward to pinning down today was the \nstart of session deployment\n. \n\u00a0\nI\u2019m so sorry but it\u2019s become very hard for us as a small firm to continue reserving resources (facilitators) on particular dates/times only to postpone since mid-February, and at this point it\u2019s a high priority item for LCW and our CEO to get the sessions hard-scheduled asap. \u00a0\nCan we say with certainty that the first sessions will take place on Friday, May 2\nnd\n?\n \n\u00a0\nI thought it would be helpful to also review the cancellations and postponement language in the SOW \u2013 I will waive the fees that would have been incurred re: the last bullet up until now:\n\u00a0\nCancelations\n \n&\n \nPostponements:\nScheduled sessions may be canceled or postponed at any time before scheduled delivery at no cost, providing the session is rescheduled within six months, any non-refundable travel expenses will still be billed\nScheduled sessions canceled or postponed within 8-14 days of delivery, if not rescheduled, will incur a charge of 50% of the session cost, plus any non-refundable travel expenses\nScheduled sessions canceled or postponed within 3-7 days of delivery, if not rescheduled, will incur a charge of 75% of the session cost, plus any non-refundable travel expenses\nScheduled sessions canceled or postponed within 2 days of delivery, if not rescheduled will incur a charge of the full program fee, plus any non-refundable travel expenses\nCancellation and postponement charges will be invoiced immediately and may not be applied to future sessions Cancellation & postponement fees are in addition to the original session fees\nScheduled sessions postponed more than twice, no matter the notice, will incur a charge of 50% of the session cost, plus any non-refundable travel expenses\n\u00a0\nIf we believe a meeting is necessary to talk about the above, I\u2019d prefer the meeting be held sooner rather than later.\n\u00a0\nThanks, and I look forward to your response!\nBest, \nRebecca\n\u00a0\nRebecca M.

They can only choose one date and time on the registrant page. If the registrant cancels, they will need to re-register to attend any future sessions.\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u2002\u20022. Registrant cancellations: \u00a0Zoom does NOT send an email to the host when a registrant cancels their \u2002\u2002\u2002\u2002registration. The host has to manually check the registrant list within the Zoom web portal to see who \u2002\u2002\u2002\u2002has cancelled.\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u2002\u2002\u2002\u2002We can pull registration reports- would you want to pull this information in the same cadence of \u2002\u2002\u2002\u2002\u2002\u2002\u2002sending the reminders? Shelton shared that the session reminders cadence would be 5\u00a0 days prior \u2002\u2002\u2002\u2002\u2002\u2002to a session, 3 days prior to a session, and 1 day prior to a session.\u00a0 Please confirm.\n\u00a0\nThanks!\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\nJuri Mansour (She/Her)\nConsultant Project Associate\nLCW\nFrom:\n Brian Dashew <\nbrian.dashew@groupm.com\n>\nSent:\n Wednesday, March 26, 2025 8:43 AM\nTo:\n Lukeisha Paul <\nLukeisha.Paul@groupm.com\n>; Shelton Rankin <\nshelton.rankin@groupm.com\n>; Juri Mansour <\nj.mansour@lcwmail.com\n>; Rebecca Parrilla <\nr.parrilla@lcwmail.com\n>\nSubject:\n Recommendation on Culture of Inclusion program enrollment\n \n\u00a0\nHi Lukeisha: \n\u00a0\nI met this morning with Shelton and the LCW team to go over the possibility of automatic calendar notifications through the Zoom enrollment process. While the Zoom link does prompt users to add the item to their calendar (which happens automatically once the user selects to add the event), there is unfortunately no easy way for their registration to automatically trigger the calendar event creation. \n\u00a0\nThat effectively leaves us with two options: \nUse Zoom registrations which will address the issue of logins and email fidelity, but which requires the user to select the option to have the calendar event created\nUse EventBrite which will address the issue of calendar notifications, but which will leave the problem of logins in place. \n\u00a0\nMy recommendation is that the Zoom registration option has enough practical benefits that it outweighs the potential risk of users needing to select for the calendar invitation. This is especially true because it would still send automatic notifications of enrollment and reminder messages. I do caveat this recommendation with two things: \n\u00a0\nI think we should revisit after the first round of enrollments. If we find that we have seen a precipitous drop in attendance from enrollment (e.g. 80%) then I think we should revert to the EventBrite approach. \nWe have asked for LCW to also confirm that a) we can limit the number of sessions an individual can enroll for, and b) they can cancel registrations if they are unable to attend\n\u00a0\nWanted to check with you before we move this ahead. Are you comfortable with this approach? \n\u00a0\nBest,\nBrian\n\u00a0\nBRIAN DASHEW \n(he/him)\nHead of Learning, North America\n\u2014\u00a0\nwww.groupm.com\n\u00a0\n@groupmworldwide\n\u00a0\nFollow us on LinkedIn\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\nDisclaimer\nThe information contained in this communication from the sender is confidential.

One thing I was looking forward to pinning down today was the \nstart of session deployment\n. \n\u00a0\nI\u2019m so sorry but it\u2019s become very hard for us as a small firm to continue reserving resources (facilitators) on particular dates/times only to postpone since mid-February, and at this point it\u2019s a high priority item for LCW and our CEO to get the sessions hard-scheduled asap. \u00a0\nCan we say with certainty that the first sessions will take place on Friday, May 2\nnd\n?\n \n\u00a0\nI thought it would be helpful to also review the cancellations and postponement language in the SOW \u2013 I will waive the fees that would have been incurred re: the last bullet up until now:\n\u00a0\nCancelations\n \n&\n \nPostponements:\nScheduled sessions may be canceled or postponed at any time before scheduled delivery at no cost, providing the session is rescheduled within six months, any non-refundable travel expenses will still be billed\nScheduled sessions canceled or postponed within 8-14 days of delivery, if not rescheduled, will incur a charge of 50% of the session cost, plus any non-refundable travel expenses\nScheduled sessions canceled or postponed within 3-7 days of delivery, if not rescheduled, will incur a charge of 75% of the session cost, plus any non-refundable travel expenses\nScheduled sessions canceled or postponed within 2 days of delivery, if not rescheduled will incur a charge of the full program fee, plus any non-refundable travel expenses\nCancellation and postponement charges will be invoiced immediately and may not be applied to future sessions Cancellation & postponement fees are in addition to the original session fees\nScheduled sessions postponed more than twice, no matter the notice, will incur a charge of 50% of the session cost, plus any non-refundable travel expenses\n\u00a0\nIf we believe a meeting is necessary to talk about the above, I\u2019d prefer the meeting be held sooner rather than later.\n\u00a0\nThanks, and I look forward to your response!\nBest, \nRebecca\n\u00a0\nRebecca M.

While the Zoom link does prompt users to add the item to their calendar (which happens automatically once the user selects to add the event), there is unfortunately no easy way for their registration to automatically trigger the calendar event creation. \n\u00a0\nThat effectively leaves us with two options: \nUse Zoom registrations which will address the issue of logins and email fidelity, but which requires the user to select the option to have the calendar event created\nUse EventBrite which will address the issue of calendar notifications, but which will leave the problem of logins in place. \n\u00a0\nMy recommendation is that the Zoom registration option has enough practical benefits that it outweighs the potential risk of users needing to select for the calendar invitation. This is especially true because it would still send automatic notifications of enrollment and reminder messages. I do caveat this recommendation with two things: \n\u00a0\nI think we should revisit after the first round of enrollments. If we find that we have seen a precipitous drop in attendance from enrollment (e.g. 80%) then I think we should revert to the EventBrite approach. \nWe have asked for LCW to also confirm that a) we can limit the number of sessions an individual can enroll for, and b) they can cancel registrations if they are unable to attend\n\u00a0\nWanted to check with you before we move this ahead. Are you comfortable with this approach? \n\u00a0\nBest,\nBrian\n\u00a0\nBRIAN DASHEW \n(he/him)\nHead of Learning, North America\n\u2014\u00a0\nwww.groupm.com\n\u00a0\n@groupmworldwide\n\u00a0\nFollow us on LinkedIn\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\nDisclaimer\nThe information contained in this communication from the sender is confidential.

    "body": "Hi, team. One thing I was looking forward to pinning down today was the \nstart of session deployment\n. \n\u00a0\nI\u2019m so sorry but it\u2019s become very hard for us as a small firm to continue reserving resources (facilitators) on particular dates/times only to postpone since mid-February, and at this point it\u2019s a high priority item for LCW and our CEO to get the sessions hard-scheduled asap. \u00a0\nCan we say with certainty that the first sessions will take place on Friday, May 2\nnd\n?\n \n\u00a0\nI thought it would be helpful to also review the cancellations and postponement language in the SOW \u2013 I will waive the fees that would have been incurred re: the last bullet up until now:\n\u00a0\nCancelations\n \n&\n \nPostponements:\nScheduled sessions may be canceled or postponed at any time before scheduled delivery at no cost, providing the session is rescheduled within six months, any non-refundable travel expenses will still be billed\nScheduled sessions canceled or postponed within 8-14 days of delivery, if not rescheduled, will incur a charge of 50% of the session cost, plus any non-refundable travel expenses\nScheduled sessions canceled or postponed within 3-7 days of delivery, if not rescheduled, will incur a charge of 75% of the session cost, plus any non-refundable travel expenses\nScheduled sessions canceled or postponed within 2 days of delivery, if not rescheduled will incur a charge of the full program fee, plus any non-refundable travel expenses\nCancellation and postponement charges will be invoiced immediately and may not be applied to future sessions Cancellation & postponement fees are in addition to the original session fees\nScheduled sessions postponed more than twice, no matter the notice, will incur a charge of 50% of the session cost, plus any non-refundable travel expenses\n\u00a0\nIf we believe a meeting is necessary to talk about the above, I\u2019d prefer the meeting be held sooner rather than later.\n\u00a0\nThanks, and I look forward to your response!\nBest, \nRebecca\n\u00a0\nRebecca M.

We were just discussing the possibility of switching Canada\u2019s program to package their program as a cohort. This would entail keeping the May sessions but having the first date be for UYCL and the second date being for the Leading Inclusively session rather that another UYCL. We would then do the same thing in October/November. Would this option work with your team and facilitators?

While the Zoom link does prompt users to add the item to their calendar (which happens automatically once the user selects to add the event), there is unfortunately no easy way for their registration to automatically trigger the calendar event creation. \n\u00a0\nThat effectively leaves us with two options: \nUse Zoom registrations which will address the issue of logins and email fidelity, but which requires the user to select the option to have the calendar event created\nUse EventBrite which will address the issue of calendar notifications, but which will leave the problem of logins in place. \n\u00a0\nMy recommendation is that the Zoom registration option has enough practical benefits that it outweighs the potential risk of users needing to select for the calendar invitation. This is especially true because it would still send automatic notifications of enrollment and reminder messages. I do caveat this recommendation with two things: \n\u00a0\nI think we should revisit after the first round of enrollments. If we find that we have seen a precipitous drop in attendance from enrollment (e.g. 80%) then I think we should revert to the EventBrite approach. \nWe have asked for LCW to also confirm that a) we can limit the number of sessions an individual can enroll for, and b) they can cancel registrations if they are unable to attend\n\u00a0\nWanted to check with you before we move this ahead. Are you comfortable with this approach? \n\u00a0\nBest,\nBrian\n\u00a0\nBRIAN DASHEW \n(he/him)\nHead of Learning, North America\n\u2014\u00a0\nwww.groupm.com\n\u00a0\n@groupmworldwide\n\u00a0\nFollow us on LinkedIn\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\nDisclaimer\nThe information contained in this communication from the sender is confidential.

We are meeting with our Canada team early next week.\nThanks,\nEvan\n\u00a0\nFrom:\n Rebecca Parrilla <r.parrilla@lcwmail.com> \nSent:\n Thursday, March 27, 2025 3:24 PM\nTo:\n Tarshish, Evan (he/him/his) <evan.tarshish@bsci.com>; Juri Mansour <j.mansour@lcwmail.com>; Delgado Carranza, Priscila (she/her/hers) <Priscila.DelgadoCarranza@bsci.com>; Bird, Shani (she/her/hers) <Shani.Bird@bsci.com>\nSubject:\n RE: {External} RE: ARCH Canada New Cohort Options\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\nCAUTION\n: This email originated from outside of the organization.

This would entail keeping the May sessions but having the first date be for UYCL and the second date being for the Leading Inclusively session rather that another UYCL.

While the Zoom link does prompt users to add the item to their calendar (which happens automatically once the user selects to add the event), there is unfortunately no easy way for their registration to automatically trigger the calendar event creation. \n\u00a0\nThat effectively leaves us with two options: \nUse Zoom registrations which will address the issue of logins and email fidelity, but which requires the user to select the option to have the calendar event created\nUse EventBrite which will address the issue of calendar notifications, but which will leave the problem of logins in place. \n\u00a0\nMy recommendation is that the Zoom registration option has enough practical benefits that it outweighs the potential risk of users needing to select for the calendar invitation. This is especially true because it would still send automatic notifications of enrollment and reminder messages. I do caveat this recommendation with two things: \n\u00a0\nI think we should revisit after the first round of enrollments. If we find that we have seen a precipitous drop in attendance from enrollment (e.g. 80%) then I think we should revert to the EventBrite approach. \nWe have asked for LCW to also confirm that a) we can limit the number of sessions an individual can enroll for, and b) they can cancel registrations if they are unable to attend\n\u00a0\nWanted to check with you before we move this ahead. Are you comfortable with this approach? \n\u00a0\nBest,\nBrian\n\u00a0\nBRIAN DASHEW \n(he/him)\nHead of Learning, North America\n\u2014\u00a0\nwww.groupm.com\n\u00a0\n@groupmworldwide\n\u00a0\nFollow us on LinkedIn\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\nPrivileged/Confidential Information may be contained in this message.

While the Zoom link does prompt users to add the item to their calendar (which happens automatically once the user selects to add the event), there is unfortunately no easy way for their registration to automatically trigger the calendar event creation. \n\u00a0\nThat effectively leaves us with two options: \nUse Zoom registrations which will address the issue of logins and email fidelity, but which requires the user to select the option to have the calendar event created\nUse EventBrite which will address the issue of calendar notifications, but which will leave the problem of logins in place. \n\u00a0\nMy recommendation is that the Zoom registration option has enough practical benefits that it outweighs the potential risk of users needing to select for the calendar invitation. This is especially true because it would still send automatic notifications of enrollment and reminder messages. I do caveat this recommendation with two things: \n\u00a0\nI think we should revisit after the first round of enrollments. If we find that we have seen a precipitous drop in attendance from enrollment (e.g. 80%) then I think we should revert to the EventBrite approach. \nWe have asked for LCW to also confirm that a) we can limit the number of sessions an individual can enroll for, and b) they can cancel registrations if they are unable to attend\n\u00a0\nWanted to check with you before we move this ahead. Are you comfortable with this approach? \n\u00a0\nBest,\nBrian\n\u00a0\nBRIAN DASHEW \n(he/him)\nHead of Learning, North America\n\u2014\u00a0\nwww.groupm.com\n\u00a0\n@groupmworldwide\n\u00a0\nFollow us on LinkedIn\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\nPrivileged/Confidential Information may be contained in this message.

We were just discussing the possibility of switching Canada\u2019s program to package their program as a cohort. This would entail keeping the May sessions but having the first date be for UYCL and the second date being for the Leading Inclusively session rather that another UYCL. We would then do the same thing in October/November. Would this option work with your team and facilitators?

A few key points to note:\n\u00a0\nPenang site arrangements: Due to Penang site regulations on food entry, all Penang-based participants will attend both sessions together in one meeting room, as mentioned earlier. Please help arrange the breakout setup so they can join the offline breakout group discussions.\nHRLT participation highlight:\nDaphne Ong, VP HR, APAC, will join both sessions. She\u2019s been a strong supporter of bringing ARCH to APAC from the start, and her presence will be invaluable. Unfortunately, she has a prior commitment as a speaker at an ESG event and will need to step away during the second hour of session 1. It\u2019s not ideal, and I appreciate your support in helping her catch up for session 2.\nPriscilla Hua, HR Leader, Greater China, will attend session 1 only. Unfortunately, she has a key role in the PI kick-off meeting in China next week. She adjusted her flight to join session 1 but can\u2019t extend her schedule for session 2. Given her leadership and commitment, we agreed to make an exception for her to attend session 1 only this round. I appreciate your kind understanding.\n\u00a0\nI\u2019ve also attached the updated BSC Employee Engagement Pulse Survey results, including Penang data.\n\u00a0\nOn a separate note, I\u2019m looking forward to meeting with Yuko next Monday. Please let me know if there\u2019s anything else needed from my side.

We learnt that our Penang manufacturing site has specific regulations on food entry into the workplace. The team will need to book a meeting room so that they can attend the training and have a working lunch, as eating at their cubicles isn\u2019t allowed.\n\u00a0\nEvan and I connected yesterday on other preparations. Our class registration reached 49 pax \u2014 just one more to go. I\u2019ll make a final push to those yet to register and share the participant list with this group by Friday US time, so you can use it to plan the virtual breakouts.\n\u00a0\nAdditionally, I\u2019ll be sending over the APAC Employee Engagement index (including Penang) that we agreed to incorporate into the LI session.\n\u00a0\n@Tarshish, Evan (he/him/his)\n \u2014 feel free to add anything I may have missed.\n\u00a0\nLooking forward to the session!\n\u00a0\nBest regards,\nRose\n\u00a0\nFrom:\n Rebecca Parrilla <\nr.parrilla@lcwmail.com\n> \nSent:\n Thursday, March 20, 2025 2:27 AM\nTo:\n Gu, Rose (she/her/hers) <\nRose.Gu@bsci.com\n>; Ong, Joyce <\nJoyce.Ong@bsci.com\n>; Sarkar, Samrat (he/him/his) <\nSamrat.Sarkar@bsci.com\n>\nCc:\n Juri Mansour <\nj.mansour@lcwmail.com\n>; Tarshish, Evan (he/him/his) <\nevan.tarshish@bsci.com\n>; Delgado Carranza, Priscila (she/her/hers) <\nPriscila.DelgadoCarranza@bsci.com\n>; Bird, Shani (she/her/hers) <\nShani.Bird@bsci.com\n>\nSubject:\n {External} Schedule 15-min call to meet facilitator?\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\nCAUTION\n: This email originated from outside of the organization.

She is located in Kobe, Japan (bio attached), one hour ahead of Singapore.\u00a0 If so, she would be happy to. If you could throw out a few 15-min slots for maybe Monday or Tuesday (or this Friday) I can see if calendars can connect. \nI\u2019d like to schedule a short break in each of the sessions, so that folks have time to grab their lunches. Is there a particular time that the Penang participants expect their lunch to start by, or can I design the break at a natural point somewhere \u2018around\u2019 noon?

A few key points to note:\n\u00a0\nPenang site arrangements: Due to Penang site regulations on food entry, all Penang-based participants will attend both sessions together in one meeting room, as mentioned earlier. Please help arrange the breakout setup so they can join the offline breakout group discussions.\nHRLT participation highlight:\nDaphne Ong, VP HR, APAC, will join both sessions. She\u2019s been a strong supporter of bringing ARCH to APAC from the start, and her presence will be invaluable. Unfortunately, she has a prior commitment as a speaker at an ESG event and will need to step away during the second hour of session 1. It\u2019s not ideal, and I appreciate your support in helping her catch up for session 2.\nPriscilla Hua, HR Leader, Greater China, will attend session 1 only. Unfortunately, she has a key role in the PI kick-off meeting in China next week. She adjusted her flight to join session 1 but can\u2019t extend her schedule for session 2. Given her leadership and commitment, we agreed to make an exception for her to attend session 1 only this round.

She is located in Kobe, Japan (bio attached), one hour ahead of Singapore.\u00a0 If so, she would be happy to. If you could throw out a few 15-min slots for maybe Monday or Tuesday (or this Friday) I can see if calendars can connect. \nI\u2019d like to schedule a short break in each of the sessions, so that folks have time to grab their lunches. Is there a particular time that the Penang participants expect their lunch to start by, or can I design the break at a natural point somewhere \u2018around\u2019 noon?

That doesn't mean anything is wrong with the size of the current package, but something I made their team aware of early on. I've seen some LMS that have a limit on the size of courses. Should they need an adjustment in the course size for them, the videos would need to be re-encoded for a smaller file size. Let's see if they have\u00a0an issue before quoting a few more hours to re-encode and craft a new wrapper.\n\u00a0\nIf they tested MBR and it works, that was the largest file, so perhaps we're all good?\n\u00a0\nBest,\nDustin\n\u00a0\nOn Wed, Dec 11, 2024 at 4:27\n\u202f\nPM Patricia Coleman <\np.coleman@lcwmail.com\n> wrote:\nHi Dustin,\n\u00a0\nWe had our last scheduled call of the year with ColPal.\n\u00a0\nFirst, of all, they are wondering if it is possible to add a survey link ( they would provide) to the package so that participants give their feedback after each e-learning. Let me know if that is doable and if so, out of the type of files, multi vs single scorm, which one can update the current uploaded files without replacing them ( if that is at all possible). Then, we can talk time needed and your fee separately. \n\u00a0\u00a0\nML Recruiting uploaded, tested and works. CBS is working fast, that\u2019s good!\n\u00a0\nPossible COLPAL MLS reported issue ( not LCW):\nIt seems that 1 or maybe 2 ML(s) are too big to upload. Al is checking precedents of this issue as they may have a solution.\n\u00a0\nAl shared that they have had bigger files in the past with up to 12 \u00a0languages.

That doesn't mean anything is wrong with the size of the current package, but something I made their team aware of early on. I've seen some LMS that have a limit on the size of courses. Should they need an adjustment in the course size for them, the videos would need to be re-encoded for a smaller file size. Let's see if they have\u00a0an issue before quoting a few more hours to re-encode and craft a new wrapper.\n\u00a0\nIf they tested MBR and it works, that was the largest file, so perhaps we're all good?\n\u00a0\nBest,\nDustin\n\u00a0\nOn Wed, Dec 11, 2024 at 4:27\n\u202f\nPM Patricia Coleman <\np.coleman@lcwmail.com\n> wrote:\nHi Dustin,\n\u00a0\nWe had our last scheduled call of the year with ColPal.\n\u00a0\nFirst, of all, they are wondering if it is possible to add a survey link ( they would provide) to the package so that participants give their feedback after each e-learning. Let me know if that is doable and if so, out of the type of files, multi vs single scorm, which one can update the current uploaded files without replacing them ( if that is at all possible). Then, we can talk time needed and your fee separately. \n\u00a0\u00a0\nML Recruiting uploaded, tested and works. CBS is working fast, that\u2019s good!\n\u00a0\nPossible COLPAL MLS reported issue ( not LCW):\nIt seems that 1 or maybe 2 ML(s) are too big to upload. Al is checking precedents of this issue as they may have a solution.\n\u00a0\nAl shared that they have had bigger files in the past with up to 12 \u00a0languages. He will advise and ONLY loop back to us if they cannot identify the issue.\n\u00a0\nDustin, Chuck: Have you encountered this issue before?\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\nLet me know if you have any questions,\n\u00a0\nPatricia\n\u00a0\nPatricia M Coleman\u00a0\n(She-Elle-Ella)\nSr Consultant\u00a0\u00a0\nLCW\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\nWebsite\n\u00a0\n|\n\u00a0\nTwitter\n\u00a0\n|\n\u00a0\nFacebook\n\u00a0\n|\n\u00a0\nLinkedIn\nView our upcoming events\n\u00a0| \nSign-up for our newsletter\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\nDisclaimer\nThe information contained in this communication from the sender is confidential.

You can customize the email subject, body of the email, and you can add branding.\u00a0\n\u00a0\nCan our Zoom automatically send registrants a calendar invitation? And can we customize the text on it for them?\n\u00a0\nYes, the Zoom registration confirmation email typically includes an option to add the session details to a participant's calendar by clicking\u00a0an \"Add to Calendar\" button, allowing them to add the event to their\u00a0calendar. But THEY have to click the button and add it.\u00a0 And I can change the email contact to someone besides the primary host, even though it's their account the session is made under.\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00b7\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \nHow does the reg link work when there are many session dates/times to choose from? Do we give them a different reg link for each session? \u00a0A Zoom meeting can have what they call multiple \"occurrences.\" When you select that registration for the occurrences/sessions is required, you get to choose from three options (see below).\u00a0\nYou can set up the registration page to have multiple dates and times for them to choose from. See the example below. No need for a registration page per session.\u00a0\n\u00a0\nPlease let me know\u00a0if you have any questions!\n\u00a0\nThank you,\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\nJuri Mansour (She/Her)\nConsultant Project Associate\nLCW\n\u00a0\nDisclaimer\nThe information contained in this communication from the sender is confidential.

And can we customize the text on it for them?\n\u00a0\nYes, the Zoom registration confirmation email typically includes an option to add the session details to a participant's calendar by clicking\u00a0an \"Add to Calendar\" button, allowing them to add the event to their\u00a0calendar. But THEY have to click the button and add it.\u00a0 And I can change the email contact to someone besides the primary host, even though it's their account the session is made under.\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00b7\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \nHow does the reg link work when there are many session dates/times to choose from?

Regarding your question about splitting the audiences, my recommendation is to separate the groups of native Spanish and Portuguese speakers, provided that you can arrange facilitators for each language. I think this will ensure a more engaging and effective training experience for both groups.\n\u00a0\nI have a couple of questions as well:\n1. Is there a specific number of people we should include for the program for this year? \nWe are looking to have 250 people take each session this year. For 2025, we have 5 sessions of Understanding Your Cultural Lens (UYCL) and 5 Leading Inclusively (LI) sessions. We have another 200 seats for 2026. \n2. How far apart should we schedule the sessions? \nThis really depends on what we decide. I would suggest 1-2 sessions per month starting in May. Ideally, people will sign up for their UYCL and LI sessions at the same time. We can choose to offer more UYCL sessions earlier on and more LI later or we can choose to offer one UYCL and one LI per month and treat the registrations like monthly cohort for the program. \n3. Will there be any local costs associated with the training?\n For 2025 and 2026 this cost is covered by the Global Diversity, Equity, and Inclusion team. The only potential cost I can think of is language translation for the training deck, which would be an additional regional cost. We can talk more about this option if interested at our next meeting. \n\u00a0\nLooking forward to your response and further details.\n\u00a0\nBest regards,\n\u00a0\nLuis Z\u00fa\u00f1iga Gamboa,\n Prin.

Regarding your question about splitting the audiences, my recommendation is to separate the groups of native Spanish and Portuguese speakers, provided that you can arrange facilitators for each language. I think this will ensure a more engaging and effective training experience for both groups.\n\u00a0\nI have a couple of questions as well:\n1. Is there a specific number of people we should include for the program for this year? \nWe are looking to have 250 people take each session this year. For 2025, we have 5 sessions of Understanding Your Cultural Lens (UYCL) and 5 Leading Inclusively (LI) sessions. We have another 200 seats for 2026. \n2. How far apart should we schedule the sessions? \nThis really depends on what we decide. I would suggest 1-2 sessions per month starting in May. Ideally, people will sign up for their UYCL and LI sessions at the same time. We can choose to offer more UYCL sessions earlier on and more LI later or we can choose to offer one UYCL and one LI per month and treat the registrations like monthly cohort for the program. \n3. Will there be any local costs associated with the training?\n For 2025 and 2026 this cost is covered by the Global Diversity, Equity, and Inclusion team. The only potential cost I can think of is language translation for the training deck, which would be an additional regional cost. We can talk more about this option if interested at our next meeting. \n\u00a0\nLooking forward to your response and further details.\n\u00a0\nBest regards,\n\u00a0\nLuis Z\u00fa\u00f1iga Gamboa,\n Prin.

We haven\u2019t met, I\u2019m a Principal Consultant at LCW. Your name was forwarded to me by Patricia Coleman (friend and colleague, SIETAR USA in common) and Sarah Nodarse. I understand you worked with us last year, to help Sarah culturally adapt a session for one of our clients (Boston Scientific Corp). Sarah is no longer at LCW, and I am now the account managers for BSC. \n\u00a0\nWe completed the content a few months ago, and the client is now ready to schedule a couple of sessions. Not the same session you helped us with (which is called \u201cLeading Inclusively\u201d) but a pre-req 2-hr session called \u201cUnderstanding Your Cultural Lens\u201d. We\u2019re looking for a Canadian cultural competence SME and facilitator to help us deliver this course, twice. The target audience are people leaders across departments. \n\u00a0\nWe have the content and facilitator notes ready, and we would of course ensure you are prepared and have everything you need to facilitate effectively.\u00a0 Client\u2019s locations in Canada are Brampton, Mississauga, Ottawa, and Montreal.\n\u00a0\nI\u2019m happy to walk you through the content. It does have some content about the Intercultural Development Continuum/ IDI \u2013 are you certified in this assessment? And if not, how familiar are you with this material?\n\u00a0\nThe client has just proposed the following dates (t\nhe Client\u2019s Canada team would select 1 date from round 1 and one date from round 2):\n\u00a0\nRound 1 options:\nTuesday, May 6, 2025 \u2013 10 am \u2013 12 pm ET\nTuesday, May 13, 2025 \u2013 2 pm \u2013 4 pm ET\n \n\u00a0\nRound 2 options:\nTuesday, May 20, 2025 \u2013 2 pm \u2013 4 pm ET\nTuesday, May 27, 2025\n \n\u2013 10 am \u2013 12 pm ET\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\nHere\u2019s the not-so-great news - our budget is quite small at this time due to current strains to our industry and our small firm\u2026. So we can\u2019t pay our usual rates at this time. We cannot afford to pay more than $250 per hour of facilitation, so the total would be $250*2 hours = $500 * 2 sessions = $1k US (including prep).\n\u00a0\nWould this be something you would be available for and interested in?\n\u00a0\nLater in the year we would ask for your partnership in delivering the 3-hour \u201cLeading Inclusively\u201d course I mentioned above. \n\u00a0\nLooking forward to hearing from you!\nRebecca\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\nRebecca M.

And can we customize the text on it for them?\n\u00a0\nYes, the Zoom registration confirmation email typically includes an option to add the session details to a participant's calendar by clicking\u00a0an \"Add to Calendar\" button, allowing them to add the event to their\u00a0calendar. But THEY have to click the button and add it.\u00a0 And I can change the email contact to someone besides the primary host, even though it's their account the session is made under.\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00b7\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \nHow does the reg link work when there are many session dates/times to choose from? Do we give them a different reg link for each session? \u00a0A Zoom meeting can have what they call multiple \"occurrences.\" When you select that registration for the occurrences/sessions is required, you get to choose from three options (see below).\u00a0\nYou can set up the registration page to have multiple dates and times for them to choose from. See the example below.

Informed the team that Rebecca will be on vacation and unavailable from March 6 through March 14, returning to the office on Monday, March 17. \u00a0\n\u00a0\n2/18/25 \nClient confirms that \n\u00a0that both dates must be rescheduled because they are both on Fridays. \u00a0\n\u00a0\nAs of now, \nwaiting to hear from BSC if the\n \nsame time range (11am-1pm and 11am-2pm local time) works on days other than Fridays for the initial sessions\n. \n\u00a0\nSo this is where we are at the moment. \n\u00a0\nI will of course get back with you as soon as I have new dates.

We can\u2019t afford to pay more than $300 per hour of facilitation, so the total would be $300*2 + $300*3 = $1500 for both sessions including prep. \n\u00a0\nLet me know what you think.\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\nJuri Mansour (She/Her)\nConsultant Project Associate\nLCW\n<image001.jpg>\nFrom:\n Rebecca Parrilla <\nr.parrilla@lcwmail.com\n>\nSent:\n Monday, February 3, 2025 7:47 AM\nTo:\n Yuko Deneuville <\nyuko@yukodeneuville.com\n>\nCc:\n Juri Mansour <\nj.mansour@lcwmail.com\n>\nSubject:\n RE: LCW: Request For Facilitator: APAC - Intercultural Competence SME\n \n\u00a0\nHi, Yuko.

I apologize for the slight delay in my response, as I\u2019ve been in Paris for the end-of-year celebrations.\nThank you so much for reaching out and for considering me for this exciting opportunity. I would be delighted to support LCW and the client in delivering these workshops. Based on my experience facilitating similar programs\u2014including my previous collaboration with LCW\u2014I am confident in my ability to deliver impactful sessions for their Asia Pacific leaders.\nRegarding fees, here is an outline of my expectations for facilitating sessions with prepared material:\nFee for \"Understanding Your Cultural Lens\" (2 hours):\n $800-$950 per session\nFee for \"Leading Inclusively\" (3 hours):\n $1000-$1250 per session\nOf course, if this fee structure does not align with LCW's budget, I am happy to discuss and explore options to ensure a mutually agreeable arrangement. It\u2019s an honor to be considered for this project, and I\u2019m committed to delivering value to both LCW and the client.\nAdditionally, I\u2019ve attached my updated bio and resume adapted to the APAC market, for your reference. Please don\u2019t hesitate to let me know if there are further details or preparations required as we move forward.\nLooking forward to hearing your thoughts!\nWarm regards,\n\u00a0\nYuko\nYuko Deneuville, PCC, CPC & ELI-MP\nIntercultural Transition Coach\nwww.yukodeneuville.com\n\u00a0\nJapan: \n+81 (0)80 3820-9385\nUSA: +1 (585) 490-9385\nyuko@yukodeneuville.com\nMy Linkedin profile\n\u00a0\n<image002.jpg>\n\"Bloom.

You come highly recommended by my friend/colleague Patricia Coleman. I am a Project Manager with LCW, as you know from working on the UL Solutions Global Inclusion Forum.\nWe've been booked to deliver a few virtual workshops for Asia Pacific people leaders from one of our global clients, a large medical devices company. One session is a 2-hour foundational intercultural competence session called \"Understanding Your Cultural Lens,\" and the other is a 3-hour session called \"Leading Inclusively.\" We don't have exact dates yet but have been told they will take place in March/April/May and August/September/October of 2025. We're looking for a skilled and experienced intercultural competence SME/facilitator with an APAC cultural background who would be available and interested in facilitating these sessions for us. The client has leaders in Japan, China, South Korea, India, and five countries in Southeast Asia.\nThe workshops will be delivered in English, but the client has requested multilingual facilitators just in case it's necessary to revert to participants' native language to answer a question. We're also speaking with a native Chinese speaker, for example. The sessions, which will have about 50 participants each (max), will also need to be delivered during reasonable hours in the region (from India to the Philippines).\nWe\u2019re in the early stages of planning, but we've begun looking for people potentially interested in working with us on this project. Can you possibly give us an idea of your fee for such a project (assuming you facilitate two \"UYCL\" sessions and two \"Leading Inclusively\" sessions)? The content is complete, and we would of course ensure you are prepared and have everything you need to facilitate effectively.\nAlso, is this your most recent bio? If not, would you mind sharing an updated bio with us? What is your experience facilitating such workshops for corporates?\nArigato!\nJuri Mansour (She/Her)\nConsultant Project Associate\nLCW\n<image001.jpg>\n\u00a0\nDisclaimer\nThe information contained in this communication from the sender is confidential.

Informed the team that Rebecca will be on vacation and unavailable from March 6 through March 14, returning to the office on Monday, March 17. \u00a0\n\u00a0\n2/18/25 \nClient confirms that \n\u00a0that both dates must be rescheduled because they are both on Fridays. \u00a0\n\u00a0\nAs of now, \nwaiting to hear from BSC if the\n \nsame time range (11am-1pm and 11am-2pm local time) works on days other than Fridays for the initial sessions\n. \n\u00a0\nSo this is where we are at the moment. \n\u00a0\nI will of course get back with you as soon as I have new dates.

The sessions are meant for people leaders, but the HR folks are experiencing it first to help advocate, clarify and support future participants through their HR channels.\n\u00a0\nOur budget is quite small at this time due to current strains to our industry, as I\u2019m sure you\u2019re well aware\u2026. So we can\u2019t pay our usual rates at this time. We can\u2019t afford to pay more than $300 per hour of facilitation, so the total would be $300*2 + $300*3 = $1500 for both sessions including prep. \n\u00a0\nLet me know what you think.\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\nJuri Mansour (She/Her)\nConsultant Project Associate\nLCW\n<image001.jpg>\nFrom:\n Rebecca Parrilla <\nr.parrilla@lcwmail.com\n>\nSent:\n Monday, February 3, 2025 7:47 AM\nTo:\n Yuko Deneuville <\nyuko@yukodeneuville.com\n>\nCc:\n Juri Mansour <\nj.mansour@lcwmail.com\n>\nSubject:\n RE: LCW: Request For Facilitator: APAC - Intercultural Competence SME\n \n\u00a0\nHi, Yuko.

I would be delighted to support LCW and the client in delivering these workshops. Based on my experience facilitating similar programs\u2014including my previous collaboration with LCW\u2014I am confident in my ability to deliver impactful sessions for their Asia Pacific leaders.\nRegarding fees, here is an outline of my expectations for facilitating sessions with prepared material:\nFee for \"Understanding Your Cultural Lens\" (2 hours):\n $800-$950 per session\nFee for \"Leading Inclusively\" (3 hours):\n $1000-$1250 per session\nOf course, if this fee structure does not align with LCW's budget, I am happy to discuss and explore options to ensure a mutually agreeable arrangement.

You come highly recommended by my friend/colleague Patricia Coleman. I am a Project Manager with LCW, as you know from working on the UL Solutions Global Inclusion Forum.\nWe've been booked to deliver a few virtual workshops for Asia Pacific people leaders from one of our global clients, a large medical devices company. One session is a 2-hour foundational intercultural competence session called \"Understanding Your Cultural Lens,\" and the other is a 3-hour session called \"Leading Inclusively.\" We don't have exact dates yet but have been told they will take place in March/April/May and August/September/October of 2025. We're looking for a skilled and experienced intercultural competence SME/facilitator with an APAC cultural background who would be available and interested in facilitating these sessions for us. The client has leaders in Japan, China, South Korea, India, and five countries in Southeast Asia.\nThe workshops will be delivered in English, but the client has requested multilingual facilitators just in case it's necessary to revert to participants' native language to answer a question. We're also speaking with a native Chinese speaker, for example. The sessions, which will have about 50 participants each (max), will also need to be delivered during reasonable hours in the region (from India to the Philippines).\nWe\u2019re in the early stages of planning, but we've begun looking for people potentially interested in working with us on this project. Can you possibly give us an idea of your fee for such a project (assuming you facilitate two \"UYCL\" sessions and two \"Leading Inclusively\" sessions)? The content is complete, and we would of course ensure you are prepared and have everything you need to facilitate effectively.\nAlso, is this your most recent bio? If not, would you mind sharing an updated bio with us? What is your experience facilitating such workshops for corporates?\nArigato!\nJuri Mansour (She/Her)\nConsultant Project Associate\nLCW\n<image001.jpg>\n\u00a0\nDisclaimer\nThe information contained in this communication from the sender is confidential.

Can you explain what that tracking looks like as we will need to make sure we have accurate attendance for this session. In the future, we will be able to track. \nHow will LCW share the course evaluations data for the UYCL and LI sessions? There are survey evaluations at the end of the two presentations.\nIn a previous email from Rebecca on 2/3 she mentioned that she did not find any 2024 course evaluations as BSC has sent their own.

We haven\u2019t met, I\u2019m a Principal Consultant at LCW. Your name was forwarded to me by Patricia Coleman (friend and colleague, SIETAR USA in common) and Sarah Nodarse. I understand you worked with us last year, to help Sarah culturally adapt a session for one of our clients (Boston Scientific Corp). Sarah is no longer at LCW, and I am now the account managers for BSC. \n\u00a0\nWe completed the content a few months ago, and the client is now ready to schedule a couple of sessions. Not the same session you helped us with (which is called \u201cLeading Inclusively\u201d) but a pre-req 2-hr session called \u201cUnderstanding Your Cultural Lens\u201d. We\u2019re looking for a Canadian cultural competence SME and facilitator to help us deliver this course, twice. The target audience are people leaders across departments. \n\u00a0\nWe have the content and facilitator notes ready, and we would of course ensure you are prepared and have everything you need to facilitate effectively.\u00a0 Client\u2019s locations in Canada are Brampton, Mississauga, Ottawa, and Montreal.\n\u00a0\nI\u2019m happy to walk you through the content.

So we can\u2019t pay our usual rates at this time. We cannot afford to pay more than $250 per hour of facilitation, so the total would be $250*2 hours = $500 * 2 sessions = $1k US (including prep).\n\u00a0\nWould this be something you would be available for and interested in?\n\u00a0\nLater in the year we would ask for your partnership in delivering the 3-hour \u201cLeading Inclusively\u201d course I mentioned above. \n\u00a0\nLooking forward to hearing from you!\nRebecca\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\nRebecca M.

We haven\u2019t met, I\u2019m a Principal Consultant at LCW. Your name was forwarded to me by Patricia Coleman (friend and colleague, SIETAR USA in common) and Sarah Nodarse. I understand you worked with us last year, to help Sarah culturally adapt a session for one of our clients (Boston Scientific Corp). Sarah is no longer at LCW, and I am now the account managers for BSC. \n\u00a0\nWe completed the content a few months ago, and the client is now ready to schedule a couple of sessions. Not the same session you helped us with (which is called \u201cLeading Inclusively\u201d) but a pre-req 2-hr session called \u201cUnderstanding Your Cultural Lens\u201d. We\u2019re looking for a Canadian cultural competence SME and facilitator to help us deliver this course, twice. The target audience are people leaders across departments. \n\u00a0\nWe have the content and facilitator notes ready, and we would of course ensure you are prepared and have everything you need to facilitate effectively.\u00a0 Client\u2019s locations in Canada are Brampton, Mississauga, Ottawa, and Montreal.\n\u00a0\nI\u2019m happy to walk you through the content. It does have some content about the Intercultural Development Continuum/ IDI \u2013 are you certified in this assessment? And if not, how familiar are you with this material?\n\u00a0\nThe client has just proposed the following dates (t\nhe Client\u2019s Canada team would select 1 date from round 1 and one date from round 2):\n\u00a0\nRound 1 options:\nTuesday, May 6, 2025 \u2013 10 am \u2013 12 pm ET\nTuesday, May 13, 2025 \u2013 2 pm \u2013 4 pm ET\n \n\u00a0\nRound 2 options:\nTuesday, May 20, 2025 \u2013 2 pm \u2013 4 pm ET\nTuesday, May 27, 2025\n \n\u2013 10 am \u2013 12 pm ET\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\nHere\u2019s the not-so-great news - our budget is quite small at this time due to current strains to our industry and our small firm\u2026. So we can\u2019t pay our usual rates at this time. We cannot afford to pay more than $250 per hour of facilitation, so the total would be $250*2 hours = $500 * 2 sessions = $1k US (including prep).\n\u00a0\nWould this be something you would be available for and interested in?\n\u00a0\nLater in the year we would ask for your partnership in delivering the 3-hour \u201cLeading Inclusively\u201d course I mentioned above. \n\u00a0\nLooking forward to hearing from you!\nRebecca\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\nRebecca M.

We haven\u2019t met, I\u2019m a Principal Consultant at LCW. Your name was forwarded to me by Patricia Coleman (friend and colleague, SIETAR USA in common) and Sarah Nodarse. I understand you worked with us last year, to help Sarah culturally adapt a session for one of our clients (Boston Scientific Corp). Sarah is no longer at LCW, and I am now the account managers for BSC. \n\u00a0\nWe completed the content a few months ago, and the client is now ready to schedule a couple of sessions. Not the same session you helped us with (which is called \u201cLeading Inclusively\u201d) but a pre-req 2-hr session called \u201cUnderstanding Your Cultural Lens\u201d. We\u2019re looking for a Canadian cultural competence SME and facilitator to help us deliver this course, twice. The target audience are people leaders across departments. \n\u00a0\nWe have the content and facilitator notes ready, and we would of course ensure you are prepared and have everything you need to facilitate effectively.\u00a0 Client\u2019s locations in Canada are Brampton, Mississauga, Ottawa, and Montreal.\n\u00a0\nI\u2019m happy to walk you through the content. It does have some content about the Intercultural Development Continuum/ IDI \u2013 are you certified in this assessment? And if not, how familiar are you with this material?\n\u00a0\nThe client has just proposed the following dates (t\nhe Client\u2019s Canada team would select 1 date from round 1 and one date from round 2):\n\u00a0\nRound 1 options:\nTuesday, May 6, 2025 \u2013 10 am \u2013 12 pm ET\nTuesday, May 13, 2025 \u2013 2 pm \u2013 4 pm ET\n \n\u00a0\nRound 2 options:\nTuesday, May 20, 2025 \u2013 2 pm \u2013 4 pm ET\nTuesday, May 27, 2025\n \n\u2013 10 am \u2013 12 pm ET\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\nHere\u2019s the not-so-great news - our budget is quite small at this time due to current strains to our industry and our small firm\u2026. So we can\u2019t pay our usual rates at this time. We cannot afford to pay more than $250 per hour of facilitation, so the total would be $250*2 hours = $500 * 2 sessions = $1k US (including prep).\n\u00a0\nWould this be something you would be available for and interested in?\n\u00a0\nLater in the year we would ask for your partnership in delivering the 3-hour \u201cLeading Inclusively\u201d course I mentioned above. \n\u00a0\nLooking forward to hearing from you!\nRebecca\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\nRebecca M.

We haven\u2019t met, I\u2019m a Principal Consultant at LCW. Your name was forwarded to me by Patricia Coleman (friend and colleague, SIETAR USA in common) and Sarah Nodarse. I understand you worked with us last year, to help Sarah culturally adapt a session for one of our clients (Boston Scientific Corp). Sarah is no longer at LCW, and I am now the account managers for BSC. \n\u00a0\nWe completed the content a few months ago, and the client is now ready to schedule a couple of sessions. Not the same session you helped us with (which is called \u201cLeading Inclusively\u201d) but a pre-req 2-hr session called \u201cUnderstanding Your Cultural Lens\u201d. We\u2019re looking for a Canadian cultural competence SME and facilitator to help us deliver this course, twice. The target audience are people leaders across departments. \n\u00a0\nWe have the content and facilitator notes ready, and we would of course ensure you are prepared and have everything you need to facilitate effectively.\u00a0 Client\u2019s locations in Canada are Brampton, Mississauga, Ottawa, and Montreal.\n\u00a0\nI\u2019m happy to walk you through the content. It does have some content about the Intercultural Development Continuum/ IDI \u2013 are you certified in this assessment? And if not, how familiar are you with this material?\n\u00a0\nThe client has just proposed the following dates (t\nhe Client\u2019s Canada team would select 1 date from round 1 and one date from round 2):\n\u00a0\nRound 1 options:\nTuesday, May 6, 2025 \u2013 10 am \u2013 12 pm ET\nTuesday, May 13, 2025 \u2013 2 pm \u2013 4 pm ET\n \n\u00a0\nRound 2 options:\nTuesday, May 20, 2025 \u2013 2 pm \u2013 4 pm ET\nTuesday, May 27, 2025\n \n\u2013 10 am \u2013 12 pm ET\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\nHere\u2019s the not-so-great news - our budget is quite small at this time due to current strains to our industry and our small firm\u2026. So we can\u2019t pay our usual rates at this time. We cannot afford to pay more than $250 per hour of facilitation, so the total would be $250*2 hours = $500 * 2 sessions = $1k US (including prep).\n\u00a0\nWould this be something you would be available for and interested in?\n\u00a0\nLater in the year we would ask for your partnership in delivering the 3-hour \u201cLeading Inclusively\u201d course I mentioned above. \n\u00a0\nLooking forward to hearing from you!\nRebecca\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\nRebecca M.

And can we customize the text on it for them?\n\u00a0\nYes, the Zoom registration confirmation email typically includes an option to add the session details to a participant's calendar by clicking\u00a0an \"Add to Calendar\" button, allowing them to add the event to their\u00a0calendar. But THEY have to click the button and add it.\u00a0 And I can change the email contact to someone besides the primary host, even though it's their account the session is made under.\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00b7\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \nHow does the reg link work when there are many session dates/times to choose from?

We do not anticipate providing regular reporting on Zoom registration to be an issue. However, I encourage you to keep access to the Eventbright registration until we confirm successful testing.\u00a0\n\u00a0\nCan you confirm the frequency in which you want the registration reporting and if there are specific time frames or dates you review this information?\n\u00a0\nI'll keep you posted.\u00a0\n\u00a0\nThank you,\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\nJuri Mansour (She/Her)\nConsultant Project Associate\nLCW\nFrom:\n Brian Dashew <\nbrian.dashew@groupm.com\n>\nSent:\n Tuesday, March 4, 2025 9:06 AM\nTo:\n Juri Mansour <\nj.mansour@lcwmail.com\n>; Shelton Rankin <\nshelton.rankin@groupm.com\n>; Lukeisha Paul <\nLukeisha.Paul@groupm.com\n>\nCc:\n Rebecca Parrilla <\nr.parrilla@lcwmail.com\n>\nSubject:\n RE: GroupM Zoom Questions\n \n\u00a0\nThanks Juri: \n\u00a0\nThis is super helpful. Would we be able to get regular reporting on the Zoom signups? That is the only other thing missing that we have in our process right now. That would prevent us from sending the reminder emails to people who have already registered and would help us to understand when we are underenrolled in a particular session. \n\u00a0\nBest,\nBrian\n\u00a0\nBRIAN DASHEW \n(he/him)\nHead of Learning, North America\n\u2014\u00a0\nwww.groupm.com\n\u00a0\n@groupmworldwide\n\u00a0\nFollow us on LinkedIn\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\nFrom:\n Juri Mansour <\nj.mansour@lcwmail.com\n> \nSent:\n Tuesday, March 4, 2025 11:06 AM\nTo:\n Shelton Rankin <\nshelton.rankin@groupm.com\n>; Brian Dashew <\nbrian.dashew@groupm.com\n>; Lukeisha Paul <\nLukeisha.Paul@groupm.com\n>\nCc:\n Rebecca Parrilla <\nr.parrilla@lcwmail.com\n>\nSubject:\n GroupM Zoom Questions\n\u00a0\nExternal:\n \n\u00a0\nHi team,\n\u00a0\nAnswers for zoom questions below:\n\u00a0\nCan we customize the Zoom registration confirmation email that goes to participants?\u00a0Yes, the Zoom registration confirmation email can be customized. You can customize the email subject, body of the email, and you can add branding.\u00a0\n\u00a0\nCan our Zoom automatically send registrants a calendar invitation? And can we customize the text on it for them?\n\u00a0\nYes, the Zoom registration confirmation email typically includes an option to add the session details to a participant's calendar by clicking\u00a0an \"Add to Calendar\" button, allowing them to add the event to their\u00a0calendar. But THEY have to click the button and add it.\u00a0 And I can change the email contact to someone besides the primary host, even though it's their account the session is made under.\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00b7\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \nHow does the reg link work when there are many session dates/times to choose from? Do we give them a different reg link for each session? \u00a0A Zoom meeting can have what they call multiple \"occurrences.\" When you select that registration for the occurrences/sessions is required, you get to choose from three options (see below).\u00a0\nYou can set up the registration page to have multiple dates and times for them to choose from. See the example below. No need for a registration page per session.\u00a0\n\u00a0\nPlease let me know\u00a0if you have any questions!\n\u00a0\nThank you,\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\nJuri Mansour (She/Her)\nConsultant Project Associate\nLCW\n\u00a0\nDisclaimer\nThe information contained in this communication from the sender is confidential.

We haven\u2019t met, I\u2019m a Principal Consultant at LCW. Your name was forwarded to me by Patricia Coleman (friend and colleague, SIETAR USA in common) and Sarah Nodarse. I understand you worked with us last year, to help Sarah culturally adapt a session for one of our clients (Boston Scientific Corp). Sarah is no longer at LCW, and I am now the account managers for BSC. \n\u00a0\nWe completed the content a few months ago, and the client is now ready to schedule a couple of sessions. Not the same session you helped us with (which is called \u201cLeading Inclusively\u201d) but a pre-req 2-hr session called \u201cUnderstanding Your Cultural Lens\u201d. We\u2019re looking for a Canadian cultural competence SME and facilitator to help us deliver this course, twice. The target audience are people leaders across departments. \n\u00a0\nWe have the content and facilitator notes ready, and we would of course ensure you are prepared and have everything you need to facilitate effectively.\u00a0 Client\u2019s locations in Canada are Brampton, Mississauga, Ottawa, and Montreal.\n\u00a0\nI\u2019m happy to walk you through the content. It does have some content about the Intercultural Development Continuum/ IDI \u2013 are you certified in this assessment? And if not, how familiar are you with this material?\n\u00a0\nThe client has just proposed the following dates (t\nhe Client\u2019s Canada team would select 1 date from round 1 and one date from round 2):\n\u00a0\nRound 1 options:\nTuesday, May 6, 2025 \u2013 10 am \u2013 12 pm ET\nTuesday, May 13, 2025 \u2013 2 pm \u2013 4 pm ET\n \n\u00a0\nRound 2 options:\nTuesday, May 20, 2025 \u2013 2 pm \u2013 4 pm ET\nTuesday, May 27, 2025\n \n\u2013 10 am \u2013 12 pm ET\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\nHere\u2019s the not-so-great news - our budget is quite small at this time due to current strains to our industry and our small firm\u2026. So we can\u2019t pay our usual rates at this time. We cannot afford to pay more than $250 per hour of facilitation, so the total would be $250*2 hours = $500 * 2 sessions = $1k US (including prep).\n\u00a0\nWould this be something you would be available for and interested in?\n\u00a0\nLater in the year we would ask for your partnership in delivering the 3-hour \u201cLeading Inclusively\u201d course I mentioned above. \n\u00a0\nLooking forward to hearing from you!\nRebecca\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\nRebecca M.

You can customize the email subject, body of the email, and you can add branding.\u00a0\n\u00a0\nCan our Zoom automatically send registrants a calendar invitation? And can we customize the text on it for them?\n\u00a0\nYes, the Zoom registration confirmation email typically includes an option to add the session details to a participant's calendar by clicking\u00a0an \"Add to Calendar\" button, allowing them to add the event to their\u00a0calendar. But THEY have to click the button and add it.\u00a0 And I can change the email contact to someone besides the primary host, even though it's their account the session is made under.\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00b7\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \nHow does the reg link work when there are many session dates/times to choose from? Do we give them a different reg link for each session? \u00a0A Zoom meeting can have what they call multiple \"occurrences.\" When you select that registration for the occurrences/sessions is required, you get to choose from three options (see below).\u00a0\nYou can set up the registration page to have multiple dates and times for them to choose from.

And can we customize the text on it for them?\n\u00a0\nYes, the Zoom registration confirmation email typically includes an option to add the session details to a participant's calendar by clicking\u00a0an \"Add to Calendar\" button, allowing them to add the event to their\u00a0calendar.

Do we give them a different reg link for each session? \u00a0A Zoom meeting can have what they call multiple \"occurrences.\" When you select that registration for the occurrences/sessions is required, you get to choose from three options (see below).\u00a0\nYou can set up the registration page to have multiple dates and times for them to choose from.

We haven\u2019t met, I\u2019m a Principal Consultant at LCW. Your name was forwarded to me by Patricia Coleman (friend and colleague, SIETAR USA in common) and Sarah Nodarse. I understand you worked with us last year, to help Sarah culturally adapt a session for one of our clients (Boston Scientific Corp). Sarah is no longer at LCW, and I am now the account managers for BSC. \n\u00a0\nWe completed the content a few months ago, and the client is now ready to schedule a couple of sessions. Not the same session you helped us with (which is called \u201cLeading Inclusively\u201d) but a pre-req 2-hr session called \u201cUnderstanding Your Cultural Lens\u201d. We\u2019re looking for a Canadian cultural competence SME and facilitator to help us deliver this course, twice. The target audience are people leaders across departments. \n\u00a0\nWe have the content and facilitator notes ready, and we would of course ensure you are prepared and have everything you need to facilitate effectively.\u00a0 Client\u2019s locations in Canada are Brampton, Mississauga, Ottawa, and Montreal.\n\u00a0\nI\u2019m happy to walk you through the content. It does have some content about the Intercultural Development Continuum/ IDI \u2013 are you certified in this assessment? And if not, how familiar are you with this material?\n\u00a0\nThe client has just proposed the following dates (t\nhe Client\u2019s Canada team would select 1 date from round 1 and one date from round 2):\n\u00a0\nRound 1 options:\nTuesday, May 6, 2025 \u2013 10 am \u2013 12 pm ET\nTuesday, May 13, 2025 \u2013 2 pm \u2013 4 pm ET\n \n\u00a0\nRound 2 options:\nTuesday, May 20, 2025 \u2013 2 pm \u2013 4 pm ET\nTuesday, May 27, 2025\n \n\u2013 10 am \u2013 12 pm ET\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\nHere\u2019s the not-so-great news - our budget is quite small at this time due to current strains to our industry and our small firm\u2026. So we can\u2019t pay our usual rates at this time. We cannot afford to pay more than $250 per hour of facilitation, so the total would be $250*2 hours = $500 * 2 sessions = $1k US (including prep).\n\u00a0\nWould this be something you would be available for and interested in?\n\u00a0\nLater in the year we would ask for your partnership in delivering the 3-hour \u201cLeading Inclusively\u201d course I mentioned above. \n\u00a0\nLooking forward to hearing from you!\nRebecca\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\nRebecca M.

I will send the evaluation links/QR code soon. I have a few questions/comments below.\n\u00a0\nCan you provide me with the SOW# for the sessions? \nSOW 2023-317\nI'm guessing the SOW owner is Rebecca for all sessions? \nyes\nZoom Meetings:\nI made all the Zoom meetings under Rebecca's Zoom account. I added the External Zoom account as an alternative host to ALL the meetings.\u00a0\nThe two Canada sessions are under one Registration link. The attendees can choose one of the meetings to register for and it will send them a link.\u00a0\nThe BSC APAC are two separate meetings with registration.\u00a0\nJas Kalra- I added them to Compass as an external consultant/facilitator. Do we want to add more information to their profile such as an email address, phone, amount per facilitation they charge...? \nI'd say yes but\n\u00a0 \n@Rebecca Parrilla\n\u00a0\nto confirm\nFrom:\n\u00a0Kaitlin Nonweiler <\nk.nonweiler@lcwmail.com\n>\nSent:\n\u00a0Monday, March 3, 2025 10:37 AM\nTo:\n\u00a0Juri Mansour <\nj.mansour@lcwmail.com\n>; Rebecca Parrilla <\nr.parrilla@lcwmail.com\n>\nSubject:\n\u00a0Re: Scheduling BSC sessions in March and May\n \n\u00a0\nReceived!

    "body": "Juri, Please see the answers to your questions below. I hope this helps! :)\u00a0\nCan the Zoom link registration email that will go out after a participant registers be customizable so that it is easy to search in their email? \nYes, the Zoom registration confirmation email can be customized. You can customize the email subject, body of the email, and you can add branding.\u00a0\n\u00a0\nCan we set up calendar invitations with zoom registration? For example, once someone registers is there an option to include the event on their calendar?\n \nYes, the\u00a0 Zoom registration confirmation email typically includes an option to add the session details to a participant's calendar by clicking\u00a0an \"Add to Calendar\" button, allowing them to add the event to their\u00a0calendar. But THEY have to click the button and add it.\u00a0 And I can change the email contact to someone besides the primary host, even though its their account the session is made under.\u00a0\nSince there are multiple sessions happening on multiple days, how does this work with zoom registration? Currently I understand that for zoom registration we get a link that would take the participant to the registration page and then when they register, they get a unique link.\nA Zoom meeting can have what they call multiple \"occurrences.\" When you select that registration for the occurances/sessions is required, you get to choose from three options (see below). I think this also answers your last question.\u00a0\nCan we input multiple dates and times for them to choose on that registration page or will we need to have a registration page for every session? \nYes, you can set up the registration page to have multiple dates and times for them to choose from. See the example below. No need for a registration page per session.\u00a0\n-Kaitlin\u00a0\nFrom:\n Juri Mansour <j.mansour@lcwmail.com>\nSent:\n Monday, March 3, 2025 10:46 AM\nTo:\n Kaitlin Nonweiler <k.nonweiler@lcwmail.com>; Rebecca Parrilla <r.parrilla@lcwmail.com>\nSubject:\n GroupM Zoom Registration Questions\n \n\u00a0\nHello Kaitlin,\nI was wondering if you could provide clarity on the following questions regarding Zoom invitation set up in the scenario that a client wanted to have registered zoom links:\nCan the Zoom link registration\u00a0 email that will go out after a participant registers be customizaible so that it is easy to search in their email?\nCan we set up calendar invitations with zoom registration?

    "body": "Hello Kaitlin,\nI was wondering if you could provide clarity on the following questions regarding Zoom invitation set up in the scenario that a client wanted to have registered zoom links:\nCan the Zoom link registration\u00a0 email that will go out after a participant registers be customizaible so that it is easy to search in their email?\nCan we set up calendar invitations with zoom registration? For example, once someone registers is there an option to include the event on their calendar?\nSince there are multiple sessions happening on multiple days, how does this work with zoom registration?

Informed the team that Rebecca will be on vacation and unavailable from March 6 through March 14, returning to the office on Monday, March 17. \u00a0\n\u00a0\n2/18/25 \nClient confirms that \n\u00a0that both dates must be rescheduled because they are both on Fridays. \u00a0\n\u00a0\nAs of now, \nwaiting to hear from BSC if the\n \nsame time range (11am-1pm and 11am-2pm local time) works on days other than Fridays for the initial sessions\n. \n\u00a0\nSo this is where we are at the moment. \n\u00a0\nI will of course get back with you as soon as I have new dates.

The sessions are meant for people leaders, but the HR folks are experiencing it first to help advocate, clarify and support future participants through their HR channels.\n\u00a0\nOur budget is quite small at this time due to current strains to our industry, as I\u2019m sure you\u2019re well aware\u2026. So we can\u2019t pay our usual rates at this time. We can\u2019t afford to pay more than $300 per hour of facilitation, so the total would be $300*2 + $300*3 = $1500 for both sessions including prep. \n\u00a0\nLet me know what you think.\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\nJuri Mansour (She/Her)\nConsultant Project Associate\nLCW\n<image001.jpg>\nFrom:\n Rebecca Parrilla <\nr.parrilla@lcwmail.com\n>\nSent:\n Monday, February 3, 2025 7:47 AM\nTo:\n Yuko Deneuville <\nyuko@yukodeneuville.com\n>\nCc:\n Juri Mansour <\nj.mansour@lcwmail.com\n>\nSubject:\n RE: LCW: Request For Facilitator: APAC - Intercultural Competence SME\n \n\u00a0\nHi, Yuko.

I apologize for the slight delay in my response, as I\u2019ve been in Paris for the end-of-year celebrations.\nThank you so much for reaching out and for considering me for this exciting opportunity. I would be delighted to support LCW and the client in delivering these workshops. Based on my experience facilitating similar programs\u2014including my previous collaboration with LCW\u2014I am confident in my ability to deliver impactful sessions for their Asia Pacific leaders.\nRegarding fees, here is an outline of my expectations for facilitating sessions with prepared material:\nFee for \"Understanding Your Cultural Lens\" (2 hours):\n $800-$950 per session\nFee for \"Leading Inclusively\" (3 hours):\n $1000-$1250 per session\nOf course, if this fee structure does not align with LCW's budget, I am happy to discuss and explore options to ensure a mutually agreeable arrangement. It\u2019s an honor to be considered for this project, and I\u2019m committed to delivering value to both LCW and the client.\nAdditionally, I\u2019ve attached my updated bio and resume adapted to the APAC market, for your reference. Please don\u2019t hesitate to let me know if there are further details or preparations required as we move forward.\nLooking forward to hearing your thoughts!\nWarm regards,\n\u00a0\nYuko\nYuko Deneuville, PCC, CPC & ELI-MP\nIntercultural Transition Coach\nwww.yukodeneuville.com\n\u00a0\nJapan: \n+81 (0)80 3820-9385\nUSA: +1 (585) 490-9385\nyuko@yukodeneuville.com\nMy Linkedin profile\n\u00a0\n<image002.jpg>\n\"Bloom.

You come highly recommended by my friend/colleague Patricia Coleman. I am a Project Manager with LCW, as you know from working on the UL Solutions Global Inclusion Forum.\nWe've been booked to deliver a few virtual workshops for Asia Pacific people leaders from one of our global clients, a large medical devices company. One session is a 2-hour foundational intercultural competence session called \"Understanding Your Cultural Lens,\" and the other is a 3-hour session called \"Leading Inclusively.\" We don't have exact dates yet but have been told they will take place in March/April/May and August/September/October of 2025. We're looking for a skilled and experienced intercultural competence SME/facilitator with an APAC cultural background who would be available and interested in facilitating these sessions for us. The client has leaders in Japan, China, South Korea, India, and five countries in Southeast Asia.\nThe workshops will be delivered in English, but the client has requested multilingual facilitators just in case it's necessary to revert to participants' native language to answer a question. We're also speaking with a native Chinese speaker, for example. The sessions, which will have about 50 participants each (max), will also need to be delivered during reasonable hours in the region (from India to the Philippines).\nWe\u2019re in the early stages of planning, but we've begun looking for people potentially interested in working with us on this project. Can you possibly give us an idea of your fee for such a project (assuming you facilitate two \"UYCL\" sessions and two \"Leading Inclusively\" sessions)? The content is complete, and we would of course ensure you are prepared and have everything you need to facilitate effectively.\nAlso, is this your most recent bio? If not, would you mind sharing an updated bio with us? What is your experience facilitating such workshops for corporates?\nArigato!\nJuri Mansour (She/Her)\nConsultant Project Associate\nLCW\n<image001.jpg>\n\u00a0\nDisclaimer\nThe information contained in this communication from the sender is confidential.

Informed the team that Rebecca will be on vacation and unavailable from March 6 through March 14, returning to the office on Monday, March 17. \u00a0\n\u00a0\n2/18/25 \nClient confirms that \n\u00a0that both dates must be rescheduled because they are both on Fridays. \u00a0\n\u00a0\nAs of now, \nwaiting to hear from BSC if the\n \nsame time range (11am-1pm and 11am-2pm local time) works on days other than Fridays for the initial sessions\n. \n\u00a0\nSo this is where we are at the moment. \n\u00a0\nI will of course get back with you as soon as I have new dates. In the meantime, are there any dates in March or April that you are NOT available?\n\u00a0\nThank you!\nRebecca\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\nRebecca M.

We\u2019re definitely committed to readjusting our rates as soon as our finances stabilize. Unfortunately, it\u2019s hard to predict when that will be\u2026\n\u00a0\nAs soon as I get the signed contract back from you, I\u2019ll send you the workshop materials! (PPT deck, which contains facilitator/speaker notes, and timed agenda). We\u2019ll set up one or more meetings to talk and go over the content, make sure you understand the client context and are comfortable with the material.\n\u00a0\nWe\u2019ll also pass along information about the participant group (roles, cultures) as soon as we get that info from the client. \n\u00a0\nThank you for your flexibility and we\u2019re very much looking forward to working with you on this project!\n\u00a0\nRebecca\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\nRebecca M.

I truly appreciate our collaboration and understand the challenges you are navigating.\nGiven the circumstances, I am willing to exceptionally accept this rate for these sessions.

We almost had snow in Tokyo last week. I have more information regarding sessions below:\n\u00a0\n2-hr \u201cUnderstanding Your Cultural Lens\u201d on Friday, March 7th at 11am Beijing time (Thu @ 9pm CT)\n3-hour \u201cLeading Inclusively\u201d on Friday, March 21st probably at the same time\n\u00a0\nThe audience will be comprised of ~50 HR and Talent Management folks from across APAC (I believe Singapore, Malaysia, India, China [Shanghai, Chengdu, Taipei], Japan). The sessions are meant for people leaders, but the HR folks are experiencing it first to help advocate, clarify and support future participants through their HR channels.\n\u00a0\nOur budget is quite small at this time due to current strains to our industry, as I\u2019m sure you\u2019re well aware\u2026. So we can\u2019t pay our usual rates at this time. We can\u2019t afford to pay more than $300 per hour of facilitation, so the total would be $300*2 + $300*3 = $1500 for both sessions including prep. \n\u00a0\nLet me know what you think.\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\nJuri Mansour (She/Her)\nConsultant Project Associate\nLCW\n<image001.jpg>\nFrom:\n Rebecca Parrilla <\nr.parrilla@lcwmail.com\n>\nSent:\n Monday, February 3, 2025 7:47 AM\nTo:\n Yuko Deneuville <\nyuko@yukodeneuville.com\n>\nCc:\n Juri Mansour <\nj.mansour@lcwmail.com\n>\nSubject:\n RE: LCW: Request For Facilitator: APAC - Intercultural Competence SME\n \n\u00a0\nHi, Yuko.

I apologize for the slight delay in my response, as I\u2019ve been in Paris for the end-of-year celebrations.\nThank you so much for reaching out and for considering me for this exciting opportunity. I would be delighted to support LCW and the client in delivering these workshops. Based on my experience facilitating similar programs\u2014including my previous collaboration with LCW\u2014I am confident in my ability to deliver impactful sessions for their Asia Pacific leaders.\nRegarding fees, here is an outline of my expectations for facilitating sessions with prepared material:\nFee for \"Understanding Your Cultural Lens\" (2 hours):\n $800-$950 per session\nFee for \"Leading Inclusively\" (3 hours):\n $1000-$1250 per session\nOf course, if this fee structure does not align with LCW's budget, I am happy to discuss and explore options to ensure a mutually agreeable arrangement. It\u2019s an honor to be considered for this project, and I\u2019m committed to delivering value to both LCW and the client.\nAdditionally, I\u2019ve attached my updated bio and resume adapted to the APAC market, for your reference. Please don\u2019t hesitate to let me know if there are further details or preparations required as we move forward.\nLooking forward to hearing your thoughts!\nWarm regards,\n\u00a0\nYuko\nYuko Deneuville, PCC, CPC & ELI-MP\nIntercultural Transition Coach\nwww.yukodeneuville.com\n\u00a0\nJapan: \n+81 (0)80 3820-9385\nUSA: +1 (585) 490-9385\nyuko@yukodeneuville.com\nMy Linkedin profile\n\u00a0\n<image002.jpg>\n\"Bloom.

You come highly recommended by my friend/colleague Patricia Coleman. I am a Project Manager with LCW, as you know from working on the UL Solutions Global Inclusion Forum.\nWe've been booked to deliver a few virtual workshops for Asia Pacific people leaders from one of our global clients, a large medical devices company. One session is a 2-hour foundational intercultural competence session called \"Understanding Your Cultural Lens,\" and the other is a 3-hour session called \"Leading Inclusively.\" We don't have exact dates yet but have been told they will take place in March/April/May and August/September/October of 2025. We're looking for a skilled and experienced intercultural competence SME/facilitator with an APAC cultural background who would be available and interested in facilitating these sessions for us. The client has leaders in Japan, China, South Korea, India, and five countries in Southeast Asia.\nThe workshops will be delivered in English, but the client has requested multilingual facilitators just in case it's necessary to revert to participants' native language to answer a question. We're also speaking with a native Chinese speaker, for example. The sessions, which will have about 50 participants each (max), will also need to be delivered during reasonable hours in the region (from India to the Philippines).\nWe\u2019re in the early stages of planning, but we've begun looking for people potentially interested in working with us on this project. Can you possibly give us an idea of your fee for such a project (assuming you facilitate two \"UYCL\" sessions and two \"Leading Inclusively\" sessions)? The content is complete, and we would of course ensure you are prepared and have everything you need to facilitate effectively.\nAlso, is this your most recent bio? If not, would you mind sharing an updated bio with us? What is your experience facilitating such workshops for corporates?\nArigato!\nJuri Mansour (She/Her)\nConsultant Project Associate\nLCW\n<image001.jpg>\n\u00a0\nDisclaimer\nThe information contained in this communication from the sender is confidential.

Informed the team that Rebecca will be on vacation and unavailable from March 6 through March 14, returning to the office on Monday, March 17. \u00a0\n\u00a0\n2/18/25 \nClient confirms that \n\u00a0that both dates must be rescheduled because they are both on Fridays. \u00a0\n\u00a0\nAs of now, \nwaiting to hear from BSC if the\n \nsame time range (11am-1pm and 11am-2pm local time) works on days other than Fridays for the initial sessions\n. \n\u00a0\nSo this is where we are at the moment. \n\u00a0\nI will of course get back with you as soon as I have new dates.

The sessions are meant for people leaders, but the HR folks are experiencing it first to help advocate, clarify and support future participants through their HR channels.\n\u00a0\nOur budget is quite small at this time due to current strains to our industry, as I\u2019m sure you\u2019re well aware\u2026.

You come highly recommended by my friend/colleague Patricia Coleman. I am a Project Manager with LCW, as you know from working on the UL Solutions Global Inclusion Forum.\nWe've been booked to deliver a few virtual workshops for Asia Pacific people leaders from one of our global clients, a large medical devices company. One session is a 2-hour foundational intercultural competence session called \"Understanding Your Cultural Lens,\" and the other is a 3-hour session called \"Leading Inclusively.\" We don't have exact dates yet but have been told they will take place in March/April/May and August/September/October of 2025. We're looking for a skilled and experienced intercultural competence SME/facilitator with an APAC cultural background who would be available and interested in facilitating these sessions for us. The client has leaders in Japan, China, South Korea, India, and five countries in Southeast Asia.\nThe workshops will be delivered in English, but the client has requested multilingual facilitators just in case it's necessary to revert to participants' native language to answer a question. We're also speaking with a native Chinese speaker, for example. The sessions, which will have about 50 participants each (max), will also need to be delivered during reasonable hours in the region (from India to the Philippines).\nWe\u2019re in the early stages of planning, but we've begun looking for people potentially interested in working with us on this project. Can you possibly give us an idea of your fee for such a project (assuming you facilitate two \"UYCL\" sessions and two \"Leading Inclusively\" sessions)? The content is complete, and we would of course ensure you are prepared and have everything you need to facilitate effectively.\nAlso, is this your most recent bio? If not, would you mind sharing an updated bio with us? What is your experience facilitating such workshops for corporates?\nArigato!\nJuri Mansour (She/Her)\nConsultant Project Associate\nLCW\n<image001.jpg>\n\u00a0\nDisclaimer\nThe information contained in this communication from the sender is confidential.

We almost had snow in Tokyo last week. I have more information regarding sessions below:\n\u00a0\n2-hr \u201cUnderstanding Your Cultural Lens\u201d on Friday, March 7th at 11am Beijing time (Thu @ 9pm CT)\n3-hour \u201cLeading Inclusively\u201d on Friday, March 21st probably at the same time\n\u00a0\nThe audience will be comprised of ~50 HR and Talent Management folks from across APAC (I believe Singapore, Malaysia, India, China [Shanghai, Chengdu, Taipei], Japan). The sessions are meant for people leaders, but the HR folks are experiencing it first to help advocate, clarify and support future participants through their HR channels.\n\u00a0\nOur budget is quite small at this time due to current strains to our industry, as I\u2019m sure you\u2019re well aware\u2026. So we can\u2019t pay our usual rates at this time. We can\u2019t afford to pay more than $300 per hour of facilitation, so the total would be $300*2 + $300*3 = $1500 for both sessions including prep. \n\u00a0\nLet me know what you think.\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\nJuri Mansour (She/Her)\nConsultant Project Associate\nLCW\n<image001.jpg>\nFrom:\n Rebecca Parrilla <\nr.parrilla@lcwmail.com\n>\nSent:\n Monday, February 3, 2025 7:47 AM\nTo:\n Yuko Deneuville <\nyuko@yukodeneuville.com\n>\nCc:\n Juri Mansour <\nj.mansour@lcwmail.com\n>\nSubject:\n RE: LCW: Request For Facilitator: APAC - Intercultural Competence SME\n \n\u00a0\nHi, Yuko.

I apologize for the slight delay in my response, as I\u2019ve been in Paris for the end-of-year celebrations.\nThank you so much for reaching out and for considering me for this exciting opportunity. I would be delighted to support LCW and the client in delivering these workshops. Based on my experience facilitating similar programs\u2014including my previous collaboration with LCW\u2014I am confident in my ability to deliver impactful sessions for their Asia Pacific leaders.\nRegarding fees, here is an outline of my expectations for facilitating sessions with prepared material:\nFee for \"Understanding Your Cultural Lens\" (2 hours):\n $800-$950 per session\nFee for \"Leading Inclusively\" (3 hours):\n $1000-$1250 per session\nOf course, if this fee structure does not align with LCW's budget, I am happy to discuss and explore options to ensure a mutually agreeable arrangement. It\u2019s an honor to be considered for this project, and I\u2019m committed to delivering value to both LCW and the client.\nAdditionally, I\u2019ve attached my updated bio and resume adapted to the APAC market, for your reference. Please don\u2019t hesitate to let me know if there are further details or preparations required as we move forward.\nLooking forward to hearing your thoughts!\nWarm regards,\n\u00a0\nYuko\nYuko Deneuville, PCC, CPC & ELI-MP\nIntercultural Transition Coach\nwww.yukodeneuville.com\n\u00a0\nJapan: \n+81 (0)80 3820-9385\nUSA: +1 (585) 490-9385\nyuko@yukodeneuville.com\nMy Linkedin profile\n\u00a0\n<image002.jpg>\n\"Bloom.

You come highly recommended by my friend/colleague Patricia Coleman. I am a Project Manager with LCW, as you know from working on the UL Solutions Global Inclusion Forum.\nWe've been booked to deliver a few virtual workshops for Asia Pacific people leaders from one of our global clients, a large medical devices company. One session is a 2-hour foundational intercultural competence session called \"Understanding Your Cultural Lens,\" and the other is a 3-hour session called \"Leading Inclusively.\" We don't have exact dates yet but have been told they will take place in March/April/May and August/September/October of 2025. We're looking for a skilled and experienced intercultural competence SME/facilitator with an APAC cultural background who would be available and interested in facilitating these sessions for us. The client has leaders in Japan, China, South Korea, India, and five countries in Southeast Asia.\nThe workshops will be delivered in English, but the client has requested multilingual facilitators just in case it's necessary to revert to participants' native language to answer a question. We're also speaking with a native Chinese speaker, for example. The sessions, which will have about 50 participants each (max), will also need to be delivered during reasonable hours in the region (from India to the Philippines).\nWe\u2019re in the early stages of planning, but we've begun looking for people potentially interested in working with us on this project. Can you possibly give us an idea of your fee for such a project (assuming you facilitate two \"UYCL\" sessions and two \"Leading Inclusively\" sessions)? The content is complete, and we would of course ensure you are prepared and have everything you need to facilitate effectively.\nAlso, is this your most recent bio? If not, would you mind sharing an updated bio with us? What is your experience facilitating such workshops for corporates?\nArigato!\nJuri Mansour (She/Her)\nConsultant Project Associate\nLCW\n<image001.jpg>\n\u00a0\nDisclaimer\nThe information contained in this communication from the sender is confidential.

Informed the team that Rebecca will be on vacation and unavailable from March 6 through March 14, returning to the office on Monday, March 17. \u00a0\n\u00a0\n2/18/25 \nClient confirms that \n\u00a0that both dates must be rescheduled because they are both on Fridays. \u00a0\n\u00a0\nAs of now, \nwaiting to hear from BSC if the\n \nsame time range (11am-1pm and 11am-2pm local time) works on days other than Fridays for the initial sessions\n. \n\u00a0\nSo this is where we are at the moment. \n\u00a0\nI will of course get back with you as soon as I have new dates.

We almost had snow in Tokyo last week.

The sessions are meant for people leaders, but the HR folks are experiencing it first to help advocate, clarify and support future participants through their HR channels.\n\u00a0\nOur budget is quite small at this time due to current strains to our industry, as I\u2019m sure you\u2019re well aware\u2026. So we can\u2019t pay our usual rates at this time. We can\u2019t afford to pay more than $300 per hour of facilitation, so the total would be $300*2 + $300*3 = $1500 for both sessions including prep. \n\u00a0\nLet me know what you think.\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\nJuri Mansour (She/Her)\nConsultant Project Associate\nLCW\n<image001.jpg>\nFrom:\n Rebecca Parrilla <\nr.parrilla@lcwmail.com\n>\nSent:\n Monday, February 3, 2025 7:47 AM\nTo:\n Yuko Deneuville <\nyuko@yukodeneuville.com\n>\nCc:\n Juri Mansour <\nj.mansour@lcwmail.com\n>\nSubject:\n RE: LCW: Request For Facilitator: APAC - Intercultural Competence SME\n \n\u00a0\nHi, Yuko.

I would be delighted to support LCW and the client in delivering these workshops. Based on my experience facilitating similar programs\u2014including my previous collaboration with LCW\u2014I am confident in my ability to deliver impactful sessions for their Asia Pacific leaders.\nRegarding fees, here is an outline of my expectations for facilitating sessions with prepared material:\nFee for \"Understanding Your Cultural Lens\" (2 hours):\n $800-$950 per session\nFee for \"Leading Inclusively\" (3 hours):\n $1000-$1250 per session\nOf course, if this fee structure does not align with LCW's budget, I am happy to discuss and explore options to ensure a mutually agreeable arrangement.

You come highly recommended by my friend/colleague Patricia Coleman. I am a Project Manager with LCW, as you know from working on the UL Solutions Global Inclusion Forum.\nWe've been booked to deliver a few virtual workshops for Asia Pacific people leaders from one of our global clients, a large medical devices company. One session is a 2-hour foundational intercultural competence session called \"Understanding Your Cultural Lens,\" and the other is a 3-hour session called \"Leading Inclusively.\" We don't have exact dates yet but have been told they will take place in March/April/May and August/September/October of 2025. We're looking for a skilled and experienced intercultural competence SME/facilitator with an APAC cultural background who would be available and interested in facilitating these sessions for us. The client has leaders in Japan, China, South Korea, India, and five countries in Southeast Asia.\nThe workshops will be delivered in English, but the client has requested multilingual facilitators just in case it's necessary to revert to participants' native language to answer a question. We're also speaking with a native Chinese speaker, for example. The sessions, which will have about 50 participants each (max), will also need to be delivered during reasonable hours in the region (from India to the Philippines).\nWe\u2019re in the early stages of planning, but we've begun looking for people potentially interested in working with us on this project. Can you possibly give us an idea of your fee for such a project (assuming you facilitate two \"UYCL\" sessions and two \"Leading Inclusively\" sessions)? The content is complete, and we would of course ensure you are prepared and have everything you need to facilitate effectively.\nAlso, is this your most recent bio? If not, would you mind sharing an updated bio with us? What is your experience facilitating such workshops for corporates?\nArigato!\nJuri Mansour (She/Her)\nConsultant Project Associate\nLCW\n<image001.jpg>\n\u00a0\nDisclaimer\nThe information contained in this communication from the sender is confidential.

Informed the team that Rebecca will be on vacation and unavailable from March 6 through March 14, returning to the office on Monday, March 17. \u00a0\n\u00a0\n2/18/25 \nClient confirms that \n\u00a0that both dates must be rescheduled because they are both on Fridays. \u00a0\n\u00a0\nAs of now, \nwaiting to hear from BSC if the\n \nsame time range (11am-1pm and 11am-2pm local time) works on days other than Fridays for the initial sessions\n. \n\u00a0\nSo this is where we are at the moment. \n\u00a0\nI will of course get back with you as soon as I have new dates.

The sessions are meant for people leaders, but the HR folks are experiencing it first to help advocate, clarify and support future participants through their HR channels.\n\u00a0\nOur budget is quite small at this time due to current strains to our industry, as I\u2019m sure you\u2019re well aware\u2026. So we can\u2019t pay our usual rates at this time. We can\u2019t afford to pay more than $300 per hour of facilitation, so the total would be $300*2 + $300*3 = $1500 for both sessions including prep. \n\u00a0\nLet me know what you think.\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\nJuri Mansour (She/Her)\nConsultant Project Associate\nLCW\n<image001.jpg>\nFrom:\n Rebecca Parrilla <\nr.parrilla@lcwmail.com\n>\nSent:\n Monday, February 3, 2025 7:47 AM\nTo:\n Yuko Deneuville <\nyuko@yukodeneuville.com\n>\nCc:\n Juri Mansour <\nj.mansour@lcwmail.com\n>\nSubject:\n RE: LCW: Request For Facilitator: APAC - Intercultural Competence SME\n \n\u00a0\nHi, Yuko.

I would be delighted to support LCW and the client in delivering these workshops. Based on my experience facilitating similar programs\u2014including my previous collaboration with LCW\u2014I am confident in my ability to deliver impactful sessions for their Asia Pacific leaders.\nRegarding fees, here is an outline of my expectations for facilitating sessions with prepared material:\nFee for \"Understanding Your Cultural Lens\" (2 hours):\n $800-$950 per session\nFee for \"Leading Inclusively\" (3 hours):\n $1000-$1250 per session\nOf course, if this fee structure does not align with LCW's budget, I am happy to discuss and explore options to ensure a mutually agreeable arrangement. It\u2019s an honor to be considered for this project, and I\u2019m committed to delivering value to both LCW and the client.\nAdditionally, I\u2019ve attached my updated bio and resume adapted to the APAC market, for your reference. Please don\u2019t hesitate to let me know if there are further details or preparations required as we move forward.\nLooking forward to hearing your thoughts!\nWarm regards,\n\u00a0\nYuko\nYuko Deneuville, PCC, CPC & ELI-MP\nIntercultural Transition Coach\nwww.yukodeneuville.com\n\u00a0\nJapan: \n+81 (0)80 3820-9385\nUSA: +1 (585) 490-9385\nyuko@yukodeneuville.com\nMy Linkedin profile\n\u00a0\n<image002.jpg>\n\"Bloom.

You come highly recommended by my friend/colleague Patricia Coleman. I am a Project Manager with LCW, as you know from working on the UL Solutions Global Inclusion Forum.\nWe've been booked to deliver a few virtual workshops for Asia Pacific people leaders from one of our global clients, a large medical devices company. One session is a 2-hour foundational intercultural competence session called \"Understanding Your Cultural Lens,\" and the other is a 3-hour session called \"Leading Inclusively.\" We don't have exact dates yet but have been told they will take place in March/April/May and August/September/October of 2025. We're looking for a skilled and experienced intercultural competence SME/facilitator with an APAC cultural background who would be available and interested in facilitating these sessions for us. The client has leaders in Japan, China, South Korea, India, and five countries in Southeast Asia.\nThe workshops will be delivered in English, but the client has requested multilingual facilitators just in case it's necessary to revert to participants' native language to answer a question. We're also speaking with a native Chinese speaker, for example. The sessions, which will have about 50 participants each (max), will also need to be delivered during reasonable hours in the region (from India to the Philippines).\nWe\u2019re in the early stages of planning, but we've begun looking for people potentially interested in working with us on this project. Can you possibly give us an idea of your fee for such a project (assuming you facilitate two \"UYCL\" sessions and two \"Leading Inclusively\" sessions)? The content is complete, and we would of course ensure you are prepared and have everything you need to facilitate effectively.\nAlso, is this your most recent bio? If not, would you mind sharing an updated bio with us? What is your experience facilitating such workshops for corporates?\nArigato!\nJuri Mansour (She/Her)\nConsultant Project Associate\nLCW\n<image001.jpg>\n\u00a0\nDisclaimer\nThe information contained in this communication from the sender is confidential.
